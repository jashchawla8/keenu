If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion. If this Pepe fudder shown in the image held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth. So, look all around on CMC and I can nearly guarantee on this post itself that you will find some lowlife dedicated to fudding kendu inu. With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to 10-15 million from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot back up to 50 milly. Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

These are the 3 who have noticed us. As seen above, Kendu found itself placed top and centre on a Coinbase Wallet advertisement through our communities engagement alone. Now, every single other coin shown within that image has been listed except for Kendu. That meaning it is only a matter of time.

There is also other rewards that can be given through this same campaign through trading on the app and giving volume! so basically through pure hardwork, dedication and old school running it up, the KENDU community has single handedly been noticed by three top exchanges. To be noticed, yet alone have individual campaigns given out purely through the exchanges own desires, is so incredibly bullish it can not be understated. Now, imagine the future of kendu and what listings we might get when we start pulling back to ATH and getting that volume. A coinbase ad, Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign. What other coins do you see running on an OKX campaign, what other coins with a Bitget giveaway? Kendu is found sitting pretty with the likes of BTC and ETH on the coinbase ad aswell. The thing is though, anyone can compete in the Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign! so if you yourself are interested in doing so, get competing! it is a wonderful opportunity for anyone, whether you are already a kendu holder or not, to try and win some goods through signing up for both the OKX campaign and the Bitget giveaway.

Beyond the obvious conflict of interests of CMC having a potential bias in rankings for Binance/BNB v. Competitors.

First, I’m staggered by how many people are hostile towards bitcoin (I mean, if it’s not your jam, just move on). But I’m really amazed by how their arguments boil down to some form of name calling: “ponzi scheme”, “crypto bros”, “beanie babies”, when those comparisons don’t hold up over just a little bit of scrutiny. On the other hand, the arguments for bitcoin tend to be well reasoned and have substance. The contrast is stark to someone who only cares about logic. Of course, the news articles play on these name calling tactics in more of a subtle, “intellectual” way to give the appearance of a substantive argument, when there is none. I guess I’m just floored by how many people are fooled by this, and how rarely people use logical reasoning or critical thinking for themselves, despite all the lip service that is paid to “critical thinking”. Even people that appear intelligent because they have a large vocabulary, good rhetorical skills, are charismatic, etc, really can’t think logically. The best they can do is parrot an argument made by someone else. Sometimes I’m jealous because I’ve never been able to do this convincingly. Just wanted to share this observation. Guess it’s not new to me because, by teaching math to college students, I witness how many people are just not able to reason for themselves, and instead rely on other tactics, like associations, memorization, cheating (lol) to get by. It still surprises me though.","I’m a professor of mathematics, so I pay attention to logic and basically logic only",Positive

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons. 1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!** # ""Why was Pepecoin created?"" The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto. The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract. From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw. We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority. # Mining Rewards |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000| # Inflation Rate Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact. # Official Communities * Reddit: [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord) # Reddit Tip Bot Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

And sorry in advance if this is the wrong place to talk about this. I'm not deeply involved in the crypto world. I have some basic knowledge, own a bit of BTC and ETH, but I don't have much understanding of altcoins or their ecosystems. For the past two years, a friend of mine has been heavily invested in following the TREAT, BONE, Okinami, and Ryoshi ecosystems. The only knowledge I have about this space is what she has shared with me. The problem is that I'm genuinely concerned about how deeply she's invested in this. She owns a significant amount of $TREAT and is convinced it's the next big thing in crypto—that it's just a matter of time before $TREAT dominates the market. She believes ""the trap is about to close,"" whatever that means. From an outsider's perspective, it sometimes feels like she's caught up in something unhealthy, almost like being trapped in a cult. Recently, she lost her apartment and is now living in a truck. Her health—both physical and mental—is deteriorating, and she's isolating herself more and more, refusing to see people.

I want you to send this to them. The costs of printing U.S. dollars involve multiple layers, including material costs, operational costs, labor, security, and transportation. Here's a breakdown of the known variables and their approximate contributions: # Material Costs * **Paper**: U.S. currency is printed on a special blend of 75% cotton and 25% linen paper. * **Ink and Dyes**: Currency uses specialized inks, including color-shifting ink for security features. * **Holograms and Security Threads**: Features like watermarks and microprinting add to the cost. *Approximate Costs*: Around **$0.08 to $0.13 per note** for materials alone. This is just the cost to produce a single bank note of varying denominations. THis does not include the below costs ive outlined. # Printing Machinery * **Machines**: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) uses high-tech presses that are expensive to purchase, maintain, and operate. * **Maintenance and Upgrades**: Ongoing servicing of these machines is essential. *Annual Costs*: Estimated **tens of millions of dollars**, depending on production levels and upgrades # Labor * Skilled labor includes designers, press operators, inspectors, and administrative staff. * BEP employs approximately 2,000 people across its facilities in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas. *Labor Costs*: Estimated at **hundreds of millions annually**, as the BEP's total operational budget (including labor and materials) for producing currency is around **$1 billion annually**. I mean someone needs to do the physical work and we need to pay them for it. There is also their healthcare coverage and other expendables that go into their exitance as workers at the facility. # Security * **Guards**: The BEP contracts armed guards and uses advanced surveillance systems. * **Transportation**: Secure trucks and police escorts are used to move currency. * **Insurance**: Covers risks during production and transportation. *Security Costs*: Not explicitly broken out but a significant portion of the BEP's budget. Security can be either from a private inhouse or subcontracting company so the costs for this can vary but lets say security is provided by itself of the BEP in all stages. They can run up the charge reducing its overhead in the year end so again not only do they print money out of thin air but they can out of thin air, create there own costs of operation. # Waste Management (everything is poop) * **Abatement**: Disposing of waste ink, defective notes, and other by-products must comply with strict environmental regulations. * **Recycling**: Some waste materials, like paper, may be recycled into products like insulation. *Estimated Costs*: **Millions annually**, depending on waste volume and disposal methods. # Transportation * **Vehicles**: Armored vehicles equipped with GPS tracking. * **Permits and Escorts**: Required for high-security transport across states. *Estimated Costs*: **Tens of millions annually**. # Utilities and Overheads * **Electricity**: High energy consumption for lighting, machines, and climate-controlled environments. * **Water**: Used for cooling machinery and cleaning. *Utility Costs*: **Tens of millions annually**. The more they print, the more they work err-go the more it costs. # Total Approximate Costs The BEP estimates the cost of printing currency at **$0.07 to $0.15 per note**, depending on the denomination and security features. The total annual cost of printing currency (all denominations) is in the range of **$800 million to $1 billion**. Now lets not forget what happened in 2023 * **Volume of Production**: In 2023, the BEP produced approximately 7.6 billion notes. * **Inflation of Operational Costs**: Rising material and labor costs can increase expenses. For more precise numbers, the BEP's annual reports provide detailed financial breakdowns, **though specific security-related expenses are often classified**. Let say we wanted to ESTIMATE the grand total of all costs involved in printing the USD. We can find the number to be around $1.5 Billion ANNUALLY. This does not factor in how much money it takes to DESTROY money. The total cost falls between **$1.15 billion and $1.95 billion annually**, with **$1.5 billion** being a reasonable mid-range estimate. This estimate is based on publicly available data from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) and does not account for classified security expenses, which may add additional costs.",https://preview,Positive

That said, I still think there’s opportunity to make big moves, even with all the uncertainty. I’m in it, and yeah and finally making some money after 8 years, I’ve got FOLO, but I’m trying to be smart, selling in percentages as I go. What’s your take?

Several years ago we bought some XRP on a whim from a friend. It was located in binance apparently, not sure exactly how we got it there it was like 2018. Needless to say it just kinda sat there. Well with the spike my wife told me we should take a look and possibly sell them. Turns out several years ago binance stopped allowing folks in the US to use their accounts, we didnt know.. But hey looks like we could send our currency to another account.. So we decided to send it to a coinbase account we had, that was empty. Unfortunately, me being new thought to get the address i choose the company that is sending it, not the currency itself so I chose something called binanceus. I started the transaction, but something came up and my wife finished it. Turns out we sent XRP from binance, whom had to wrap it (wrapped xrp) because it was going to a different network. Well Coinbase doesnt deal with wrapped xrp, and said they cannot send it back as they dont deal with this kind of currency, binance also cannot help as its out of their establishment already. Coinbase did say that if they eventually accept wrapped xrp it will show up in our account. Is there any other way to get this back or a we just screwed? thanks.","Good day all, First off very new to crypto",Positive

Doesnt mean I know anything. It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10% Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place. This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever. And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter. With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future. I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 2022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened. I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess.

My question is, are the days of the wealthy (or anyone) building a large BTC position with anonymity, over? Correct me if I am wrong, but if someone buys through any regulated intermediary (Coinbase, brokerage firm, etc), the KYC will leave a paper trail of ownership by name and reporting that info to the IRS and government is required. It also seems that if someone wished to buy $10M of Bitcoin via some un-regulated international entity, there would be higher counterparty risks that dissuade the individual from doing so. Satoshi and those whose work he built on, included ""semi-anonymity"" into Bitcoin for a reason. You could see the wallets but not the real names. Not having a trusted intermediary was not just a feature, it was a benefit. Obviously this was their wish, since we still have no idea who Satoshi even is fifteen years later. When one sells BTC for a profit, the IRS in form 8949 asks for data on the original purchase and sale. But the IRS does not ask whether one owns BTC individually until a sale. At least.... so far. Just watch, that will change, I assure you.

Key Points of the Argument 1. Renewable Energy is Often Overproduced Many renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, produce electricity intermittently and sometimes generate more power than the grid can use or store during peak production times. For instance, during a sunny or windy day, energy production might exceed local demand, leading to curtailment (wasted energy). 2. BTC Mining is Location and Time Agnostic Bitcoin mining can be done anywhere with cheap electricity, and miners can ramp up or down their operations quickly. This makes it an ideal ""energy buyer of last resort."" Miners are willing to buy electricity that would otherwise go unused, often at a discounted rate. 3. Incentivizing Renewable Energy Investment By providing a guaranteed buyer for surplus energy, BTC mining can make renewable energy projects more financially viable. For example: A solar farm in a remote area might not be connected to a grid with high enough demand to justify its cost. BTC miners can set up nearby to consume and monetize the excess power. This extra income stream from mining reduces the risk and improves the return on investment for renewable energy developers. 4. Promoting Grid Stability Renewables can cause grid instability due to their variability. Bitcoin miners, as flexible energy consumers, can help balance the grid. During periods of high renewable output, miners increase consumption. When demand from other users rises, miners can scale down operations to free up energy for the grid. 5. Driving Innovation in Energy Storage and Distribution The presence of BTC mining operations might encourage further innovation in energy storage and transmission technologies. As mining grows, the incentive to develop cost-effective ways to store and transport renewable energy increases. Counterarguments to Consider While the argument is compelling, critics raise valid concerns: Environmental Impact: BTC mining still consumes large amounts of energy, and in regions where fossil fuels dominate, it can indirectly support non-renewable energy use. Opportunity Costs: The resources used for mining could arguably be better spent on other technologies, like energy storage or efficiency improvements. Economic Viability Without Subsidies: Some question whether mining alone can consistently provide enough economic incentive to justify renewable projects without additional subsidies or regulatory support. Examples Iceland and Hydropower: In Iceland, Bitcoin miners tap into abundant and cheap geothermal and hydropower energy, which otherwise might not have been fully utilized. Texas and Wind Power: In the U.S., Bitcoin mining operations have partnered with renewable energy producers to use excess wind and solar power during off-peak hours. This synergy between Bitcoin mining and renewable energy could play a role in transitioning to a more sustainable energy system, provided it's managed responsibly. PS.

""I faded kendu, i could have had millions"" Buy the blood, reap the rewards https://preview.redd.it/i1manmcupx3e1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f9c21289f4f109f67aaf80eca603ac521ff7cd0 # So why $KENDU? There is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs ""Chads"", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach. We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat. Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU https://preview.redd.it/rfeng5dtpx3e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=c65897680492dacb99635af44a130f223a8426bf We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction. This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams. We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

Sound advice, right? It emphasizes the risk of the market and the importance of not overextending yourself financially. But here's a thought I’ve been reflecting on, especially as we navigate another cycle of bull market hype: many people who believe in Bitcoin still try to time the market. They plan to sell at the top, wait for the dip, and buy back in, hoping to accumulate more BTC. While taking profits is reasonable, it carries significant risks. Here’s the quote I find more useful: “Sell only what you can afford to lose”—and I mean this in Bitcoin terms. If you sell your BTC, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to buy back at a lower price. The market might run away from you, and you could end up buying back fewer BTC for the same or higher cost. In trying to optimize your stack, you could lose part of it altogether. This isn’t financial advice, but more of a mindset shift I’ve been embracing. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, think carefully before parting with your sats. Sometimes, the best move is simply holding on for the ride. What are your thoughts? Does this resonate, or do you still try to time the market?","It's a common saying in the crypto world: ""Only invest what you can afford to lose",Positive

Bitcoin and all of crypto is actually a software technology called ""blockchain"" Everything you do on the internet requires a protocol. Examples are Videos (Mp4 is the protocol) audio (Mp3 is the protocol) Every link you click that directs you somewhere online is another protocol. Bitcoin and crypto is another protocol layer ontop of everything. Why that is important is because of the transfer of data. Currently we live in a 1to1 (one piece of data at a time) Imagine I'm giving you a bottle of water. I can either hand you 1 bottle at a time. Or a whole case, or a whole pallet, or a whole truck load at a time. That's essentially what blockchain (all of crypto) does. The more people that are on the planet. The more data you're going to use and the faster you need that data to transfer This is just one of the problems bitcoin and crypto solves. To keep things simple without going crazy with too much to read for ya I'll say this Bitcoin is like digital gold Ethereum is like digital Oil (literally needed for every crypto transaction) That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's literally 1,000's more crypto with use cases all over the board from infrastructure to banking to governments already using them including brics nation and India using xrp ripple for all oil transactions (oil is in the cars, it's cooking oil, it's used in all polyester fabrics). Feel free to ask any questions. I'm here to help. I've been in the space for about 3 years myself and the community is tremendous and filled with a lot of really smart talented people. Let's help each other. To find the right crypto you wanna be looking at infrastructure. For instance currently in this cycle. These are some of the top crypto to buy right now. Gaming , RWA (real world assets), Ai, Dpin. (Everyone feel free to add your best picks with supporting reasons) For those who are new. To start What you do is go download 2 apps. Coinmarketcap.com And Crypto Bubbles Use both of these with each other Crypto bubbles gives you price analysis And on Coinmarketcap you can sort projects by category. Crypto Bubbles will show you yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly. On any one particular project If it's more green than red across the board then it's worth looking further into. The higher percentage the better. When in doubt zoom out (Learn your Crypto lingo) When you're looking for something good it's best to find something that's up for the year. Then the month and week. Bitcoin moves 1st then Ethereum then everything else. Their will be day long periods of everything needing to catch up. Sometimes weeks or months. (Whats everyone's experience with this?) Here's a tip. All prices will fluctuate. When bitcoin goes down and you start seeing a lot of red. Use crypto bubbles and watch what recovers on the hour and daily the fastest. This usually indicates a strong project with more potential. Making it worth looking into further. Using coinmarketcap you can find the project's main webpage and do research on who owns the company, how strong the community is on different platforms, how many developers they have, who their partners are. Etc. *************************** *************************** The name of the game is doing your own research. Know who and what you're spending your hard earned money on regardless of what other people say. *************************** *************************** If anyone has anything to add to this let's grow and educate each other. This community is smart and strong. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Add resources. Which influencers do you follow. What websites do you use and why. What charts do you recommend.

Ease of Token Creation: Clanker simplifies the process of token creation to the point where it's accessible to anyone with basic social media skills. Users can deploy tokens by simply tagging Clanker on the Farcaster platform, describing their desired token, thereby lowering the entry barriers for token creators and potentially attracting a broader user base to the Base ecosystem. 2. Community Engagement and Viral Potential: The integration of token deployment with social media platforms like Farcaster encourages community participation. Memes and viral content can naturally lead to increased attention and, consequently, adoption. Clanker's tokens often become memes themselves, which can drive speculative interest and trading volume, furthering the network's visibility 3. Profit Sharing Mechanism: Clanker's model includes sharing a portion of the fees with the users who request token deployments. This financial incentive could encourage more people to use Clanker for launching tokens, thus increasing activity on Base. The promise of earning from the liquidity pool fees makes it an attractive proposition for users looking to participate in the crypto space in a potentially profitable manner. 4. Innovation in Tokenomics: By introducing tokens like LUM, which were autonomously created through AI collaboration, Clanker showcases innovative tokenomics. This not only promotes the idea of AI in blockchain but also piques interest in how tokens can be generated, possibly drawing tech enthusiasts and investors curious about new token models. 5. Fostering Decentralized Social Interaction: Clanker's operation within the Farcaster ecosystem highlights how blockchain can intersect with decentralized social networks. This intersection can lead to new forms of interaction and economic models where social engagement directly correlates with token creation, potentially making Base a hub for such activities. 6. Market Activity Boost: The surge in transaction volumes due to Clanker's activity indicates its substantial impact on the network's activity. High transaction volumes often correlate with increased interest and investment in a blockchain, which could lead to greater adoption as more participants are drawn to where the action is. Is obvous this could attract adoption for the base blockchain especially as many degen have also start speculating that the next top memecoin will come from either base chain or Sui but what do you think?

I want you to think back to what everyone was saying about touch screen cell phones, the internet, self driving cars, Uber just to name a few.

Sure prices fluctuate. Everything does. You fill up your gas tank just to drive, empty it then fill it back up. You work, get money then are forced to pay bills so you go work some more and start the process all over again. Everyone is pointing out the obvious of the prices fluctuating so much. But what do you think your bank account does? People might be broke but they're still buying Starbucks and McDonald's when they're hungry instead of investing. At least with investing you can learn to make your money work for you. Its Absolutely no different than buying lotto or investing in traditional stock markets. And how many people still do it? Hell even in the hourse races you should still do research on the horse you're betting on. Why should it be any different when investing? Whether it's stock or crypto or anything else? When you buy a house, don't you go research the reality company? Don't you go find out what the neighborhood is like? Dont you request a viewing of the property? When you buy any kind of insurance (Life, Medical, renter's, Car). Don't you compare rates? So tell me why should it be any different when investing? It shouldn't really matter what it is. You insure everything else. Why wouldn't you insure your money? Crypto isn't just currency. It has actual use cases. These crypto companies are actually at its core just software companies Just don't be stupid with it. If you're smart with it and learn proper risk management. Learn the cycles and how to find entry and exit points **************** Here's a task for anyone skeptical. Go search up on Google what the average APY/ APR is for a credit card and a savings account. Then go look up the numbers these crypto's are doing in a days/weeks/month's time. Do your own research.

I wanted to summarize the key points for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. All these gems came directly from the comments—big thanks to everyone who contributed! (Link to the original post at the end.) Key Takeaways: 🔸 Diversification is crucial: Spread your investments across sectors (real-world use cases, market cap, and even meme coins). But don’t overdo it—5 to 10 solid picks are better than spreading too thin. 🔸 Timing matters: While earlier in the year might have been better, now is still a reasonable time. Always keep some cash on hand to average down if the market dips. 🔸 Look beyond hype: Focus on altcoins with real-world utility or emerging potential. Exchange tokens and coins that haven’t peaked yet could offer great opportunities. 🔸 New vs. old projects: Top 100 coins that are newer and haven’t been through previous bull runs may outperform older projects. 🔸 Have a strategy: Avoid FOMO. Think long-term, consider privacy coins for uncertain times, and focus on what each project brings to the table.

These services include decentralized lending and borrowing, staking, and yield farming, allowing users to maximize the potential of their MANTRA tokens by earning additional rewards or lending them for a fee. In a world where governments and central banks are tightening control over traditional financial systems, cryptocurrencies like MANTRA provide a powerful alternative, giving individuals greater control over their own money. One of the standout features of MANTRA is its privacy. Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and ring signatures, it ensures that transactions remain untraceable and unlinkable. This makes MANTRA a go-to choice for those who prioritize privacy in their financial dealings. The currency’s governance model is another key aspect. MANTRA is governed by the consensus of its community members who hold MANTRA tokens, ensuring that no single entity has control over its operations. This decentralized approach makes it a truly community-driven currency. Additionally, MANTRA is designed to be both fast and scalable. By utilizing a proof-of-stake model, it allows for quick transaction confirmations while minimizing energy consumption, unlike traditional proof-of-work systems.

XION: Simplifying Web3 Without Wallets or Complexity ,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1h30nbo/xion_simplifying_web3_without_wallets_or/,,1,1.0,2,Past_Hotel_5987,1732928099.0,"USDC, Avalanche, Polkadot, Cosmos, Mina, Gas, Ark, Mode, Ren, MAD, AVA, Kin, MON, UNI","Web3 is often seen as complicated—wallets, gas fees, and technical jargon can scare off new users. XION is here to change that by offering a much simpler blockchain experience. What is XION? XION is a Layer 1 blockchain designed with user experience in mind. Instead of traditional wallets, it uses a ""meta-account"" that removes the hassle of managing private keys and paying gas fees. You can even pay fees in USDC, making things more predictable. Fee Abstraction Made Easy One of the biggest headaches in Web3 is dealing with fluctuating gas fees. XION solves this by allowing users to pay fees in USDC, making it way easier to manage transactions without worrying about price changes in crypto. Meta-Account: No More Wallets The ""meta-account"" model eliminates the need for traditional wallets. It allows for centralized management with security features like multi-factor authentication, making it easier for non-crypto users to get started. Better Cross-Chain Interoperability Interoperability between blockchains is a huge issue. XION simplifies this by letting users interact with multiple blockchains via a single account. No more juggling multiple wallets. Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche work on blockchain communication, but XION goes a step further. While Polkadot and Cosmos allow blockchains to communicate, users still need to manage multiple wallets and complicated processes. XION makes it seamless, allowing multiple chains to work together without the user even noticing. Conclusion XION aims to make blockchain easier for everyone by eliminating common Web3 barriers like wallets, gas fees, and interoperability. While it’s still early, XION could help bring blockchain to the masses. Their token is listed on Bitget Pre-market and their TGE is coming soon. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xion/","Web3 is often seen as complicated—wallets, gas fees, and technical jargon can scare off new users",Positive

Holding on has definitely paid off! Instead of letting your SOL sit idle, why not put it to work? Staking is an excellent way to do this. You have options like BGSOL, which lets you stake your SOL while maintaining liquidity for trading or further investments. Let's discuss how to maximize your returns while ensuring security. The Solana blockchain offers various staking options with competitive yields. BGSOL, for instance, provides an attractive APR, allowing you to stake without tying up your funds, thus offering both flexibility and growth potential. Moreover, Marinade Finance provides an APY over 11% through native staking, self-custody, and automatic delegation to top validators, ensuring both high returns and safety. They have an impressive track record with 8M $SOL TVL, making them a strong contender. You might also look into BNSOL by Binance, which offers liquid staking supported by a major exchange, adding an extra layer of security if you're already familiar with their services. If maximizing APY is your goal, these platforms are your playground. Keep in mind, though, that higher APRs can carry higher risks, so it's crucial to balance potential returns with security. Social media buzz suggests Marinade Finance is on an upward trend due to its performance and reliability, making it a good option for diversifying your staking approach. Staking isn't just about stashing your assets away; it's about growing them as you anticipate the next big Solana move. Whether you choose BGSOL, Marinade Finance, or explore other staking options on the Solana network, you're well-positioned to leverage Solana's market surge without the hassle of constant trading. Keep those earnings up and your investments safe!

I was initially drawn to Kendu just a couple of months after its inception because I noticed that unlike many memecoins, it was attempting to build out out an actual ecosystem (with the Chads Marketplace being the centrepiece of this), but also because it seemed pretty decentralised in that it emphasises community putting effort in instead of just someone at the top calling the shots. On the point about the ecosystem, I’ve [previously gone into how I’ll be putting my skills as an outside dev to build some third-party, open source tooling for the Marketplace when it launches](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1fyeurm/looking_forward_to_building_open_source_tools_for/) but also [some other ways I could see more utility coming to the project](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1fz23bh/bringing_utility_by_getting_kendu_listed_on_more/). On top of this sort of stuff, I also announced months ago that my own fairly small project, Ingex, [would look to launch a small collection on the Chads Marketplace when the latter goes live](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/1fzznt3/ingex_revenuebearing_tokens_explained_and_our/). Fast forward to today, and I’m just going to try and be as straight forward about this as possible. I think there’s been a few missteps within Kendu in recent days (and I think the dev himself has posted that he could have gone about some things in a better way). I even got to the point where I started to look at whether I should reassess some of my plans for the ecosystem. In the end, I realised two things though: going back to earlier, Kendu is *not* just one person or even a small team, it’s decentralised community of thousands of people, many of which post about it day in and day out, and it doesn’t seem like the core of this community is going anywhere. The second thing is that the main fundamentals, like launching the Chads Marketplace still seem to be on track as far as I can tell, and there hasn’t been any scaling back on the ambitions that were laid out by the team. So with those two things, and as long as nothing major changes in this respect, I will be continuing with the plans I set out months ago in terms of launching on the Chads Marketplace and even putting my skills to use by building out some open source tooling for the ecosystem. Like I said, I think the fundamentals are still there and I’m not too concerned about the short term price either because I’ve seen other projects trend downwards for long periods only to suddenly shoot up based on longer term prospects. **On this note, please consider also [supporting our project directly](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex/overview) as we've been working hard on this stuff with months now, have been consistent in meeting our milestones, and have seen the value of our token triple in recent weeks (check sale history) before we've even made our main set of annoucements.** Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu","First, a very quick background",Positive

You've likely heard the term DePIN circulating in the tech world, but what does it really mean? Let's break it down! What is DePIN? DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network. At its core, DePIN uses blockchain technology to manage and operate physical infrastructure—such as data storage, computing power, and telecommunications—decentralized. This approach shifts control from large corporations to a network of independent participants, promoting resilience, security, and user empowerment. Key Components of DePIN: 🔹 Decentralization: DePIN distributes infrastructure management across a blockchain network, removing the reliance on a single central authority. This eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risk of outages or cyberattacks. 🔹 Tokenized Incentives: Participants earn tokens by contributing resources like computing power, storage, or bandwidth. This incentivizes a self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem. 🔹Physical Infrastructure Integration: DePIN bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds by incorporating real-world assets, from decentralized data centers to community-powered telecom networks. 🔹 Points of Presence (PoPs): Distributed infrastructure points (PoPs) form the backbone of DePIN networks. At Serenity, we’re building a robust global network of PoPs to challenge the centralized dominance of tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our PoPs ensure resilience, speed, and true decentralization. Why DePIN is the Future: DePIN represents a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is managed. By decentralizing control, it democratizes access, enhances security, and fosters innovation. Industries like data storage, energy, telecommunications, and computing are already being transformed by DePIN models. Serenity's Role in DePIN: At Serenity, we're leading the way with our decentralized storage solutions: \- sBox: Secure, decentralized storage with biometric access and inheritance planning features powered by the SERSH token. \- Infrastructure Expansion: Our growing network of PoPs offers a powerful alternative to Big Tech's centralized dominance. \- Community Empowerment: With Serenity’s DePIN approach, Users! Not corporations! Control their data. Discover how Serenity’s DePIN solutions can empower you!

"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gz8rkc/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,,32,0.89,48,RegardedQt314,1732502722.0,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dai, Mina, ORDI, Memecoin, Amp, Ark, DIA, WHY, Kin, MON, Diamond, Kendu Inu, UNI","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar. **Facts** * We are the cusp of having 15K holders * Kendu is almost 10 months old * We rank top 10% in subreddit size * We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed * Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE) * Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase) * We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more. * We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine * Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu * We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started * We have the best organic community in the space, bar none Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive. We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun. There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends. ""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have: \- Inspired people hustling daily \- 6+ months old \- Survived multiple large drops \- Holder Count growing every month \- $20 Billion+ Target \- Great Distribution + Diamondhands"" Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well. Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.
