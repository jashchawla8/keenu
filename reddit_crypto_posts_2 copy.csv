My parents bought bitcoin.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h4644a/my_parents_bought_bitcoin/,,733,0.96,147,Remarkablecrumble,1733068072.0,"Bitcoin, XPLA, Ren, Kin, MON","My parents have heard me talking about bitcoin and asked if I would be willing to buy some on their behalf. I explained the risks, the possibility of a 80% drop, and they still wanted to move forward with the view of holding for at least 5 years. I helped them buy and move to cold storage. The first investment (other than a house) that they have ever put money into. Im so proud."

They said Pepe was dead. They said it was over for Shib. They say the same for us.... (Kendu Inu),https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1h44jol/they_said_pepe_was_dead_they_said_it_was_over_for/,,70,0.91,45,soFinished,1733063655.0,"Shiba Inu, Pepe, Dai, Degen, Status, Ark, Wen, WHY, Ren, ARC, Botto, Kin, MON, Kendu Inu, UNI","Welcome to the world of DeFi where a coin can only truly be dead when the community has abandoned it. If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion. If this Pepe fudder shown in the image held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth. So, look all around on CMC and I can nearly guarantee on this post itself that you will find some lowlife dedicated to fudding kendu inu. With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to 10-15 million from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot back up to 50 milly. Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green. Look at this account lose out on millions: [https:\/\/x.com\/AltcoinDailyio\/status\/1654893606292062209](https://preview.redd.it/7ylg1dlaw84e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=644f68d700111b1d9fdec5bbe5f0619599e28ff4) Look at the shib chart before its god candle happened, at the lows you would probably say that it's dead.... then you would lose out on a 60000%+ gain: https://preview.redd.it/dlre25raz84e1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=036d6dec415b999d0af9b3c78cc885a6bcd1056d Study the Shiba Inu chart, clearly, it's not over until it's over. There is always hope. Kendu will win, now is the time to load up and keep a clear mind. Lock tf in. Helmets on.

10k cash what to put in ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1h3uus8/10k_cash_what_to_put_in/,,88,0.82,345,AgitatedJackfruit780,1733026285.0,"Solana, XRP","I have 10k coming my way in exactly 11 days. I’m feeling fomo now because everything is already pumping and I feel like I’ll miss out on some big gains. If you can’t tell by the first sentences I’m new to this lol…baby new… Anywho. What should I do with the 10k if I want to be smart about it? I hold some Solana now and pocket change of BTC and ETH. XRP, doge and some others. Nothing big. This would be my biggest investment"

In 2021 everyone and their grandma were buying. You were also bombarded by shills on YT constantly and elon musk livestream scams. 2024 feels like a silent bullrun. Perhaps this is just like 2020, no one cared until the tippy top. Or maybe people got burned in 2021 and left. I know ppl lost so much money from crypto in my country that they banned leverage, stables and only btc / eth can be bought now."
