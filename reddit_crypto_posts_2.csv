Does it add *anything* relevant to the subreddit other than a reinforcement and magnification of the already obvious sentiment of the moment? I would rather see people posting (and rewarded for) their own predictions backed up by long winded (even if vague and biased) DD than some worthless nobody from nowhere pulling a number out of thin air. Posting these links here only drives traffic to these sites and encourages *more* articles of the same manner. I think the grip on ""shilling"" posts needs to be loosened a bit and ""prediction"" articles needs to be tightened. I'm happy to listen to someone claim how awesome and undiscovered xyz coin is even if they're already heavily invested. I can tell they're pushing it, I'm sure we all can. I still find that more useful than an article about how X ""could"" go to Y."

They said Pepe was dead. They said it was over for Shib. They say the same for us....

If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion. If this Pepe fudder shown in the image held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth. So, look all around on CMC and I can nearly guarantee on this post itself that you will find some lowlife dedicated to fudding kendu inu. With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to 10-15 million from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot back up to 50 milly. Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

In this approach, at a very high level, users race to solve a very complex cryptographic puzzle. The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain. Proof-of-Work suffers from several flaws. *First Flaw: Proof-of-Work Does Not Scale.* Proof-of-work is very slow. Bitcoin‚Äôs crypto puzzles are so hard in order to guarantee that one solution is found only every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners try to solve the crypto puzzle. We can understand expensive and fast. But expensive and slow is hard to understand. The world is a large place and one block of transactions every 10 minutes is hardly enough. *Second Flaw: Proof-of-Work Results in De-Facto Centralization.* Proof-of-work has caused a tremendous concentration of power. This centralization is a consequence of the fact that Proof-of-Work is both expensive and wasteful. The amount of computation performed by the *miners* ‚Äî that is, the users trying to solve the crypto puzzles ‚Äîis stunning. Mining today utilizes racks and racks of specialized hardware and consumes an enormous amount of electricity. One miner wins the race and generates the new block, and the efforts of all the others are wasted. Without the subsidies that Bitcoin currently offers, the cost of posting a single transaction on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is around $20. Not the way to go if you want to use the blockchain for everyday transactions like buying a slice of pizza or if you want to use it offer financial services to those 2.2 billion who are currently not served by the financial system. The common user would lose money if she tried to solve the crypto puzzle with her laptop. Win or lose, she must pay for the electricity necessary to power the computations of her laptop. This amount of electricity may not be big, but her probability of winning is so small that, in expectation, she would lose money. Only professional miners, who have made the capital expenditure necessary to buy racks and racks of hyper specialized mining equipment, can expect to make a small profit. Accordingly, only they participate in block generation. Furthermore, miners consociate in *mining pools*. Today, Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is controlled by just three mining pools and Ethereum‚Äôs by just two mining pools. If they so decide, or if they are bribed to do so, these mining pools can rewrite the database: they can erase blocks or change the order of blocks. Proof-of-work has turned what was intended to be a decentralized system into an extremely centralized one. *Third Flaw: Proof-of-Work Is Not Secure.* As we said, any blockchain that is centralized, whether by design or *de facto*, is insecure. But proof-of-work has additional vulnerabilities, and it is especially vulnerable to network attacks. A blockchain ultimately is a communication protocol, and any such protocol is executed over an underlying communication network. An adversary may thus attack either the protocol ‚Äî e.g., by sending messages that are different from the prescribed ones ‚Äî or the communication network itself ‚Äî e.g., by interfering with routers, cables, etc. Just how insecure proof-of-work is may be underestimated because the current way of analyzing a blockchain‚Äôs security is flawed. This analysis typically focuses only on protocol attacks and neglects network attacks that, especially in the context of proof-of-work, can be deadly. For instance, in a proof-of-work blockchain, an adversary capable of partitioning the communication network for an hour or two could double-spend with impunity. In a successful partitioning attack, an adversary prevents the messages sent by the users belonging to a set of users A from reaching the users in a separate set B, and vice versa. Network partitioning has not attracted much attention, because it is considered too expensive to be practical. But the cost of a network attack may be justified, once the gains are high enough. A truly borderless economy may be valued in trillions of dollars. And an adversary may be willing to ‚Äòinvest‚Äô millions of dollars, if he stands to illicitly gain billions of dollars. *Fourth Flaw: Forks.* Another disadvantage of proof-of-work is the unavoidable existence of *forks*. Whenever two or more users solve the crypto puzzles within a few seconds of each other, the chain branches because users may now see multiple candidates for the next block. A fork may continue to exist for a while, and all its branches may even be elongated by the addition of new blocks. But eventually, all branches but one will die, and all the blocks in the dead branches will disappear. Forks are an unwelcome source of uncertainty and delay. If a payment made to you appears in the latest block added to the chain, you cannot consider yourself paid and ship the goods. This is so because some branch may overcome the current chain and your block may end up in a dead branch and vanish. Before considering yourself paid, you would need to wait for a sequence of blocks to be added to yours, so as to minimize the chance that a soft fork will arise and the block containing your payment will end up on a dead branch. How long should you wait for? Some people recommend six blocks to be added after yours to be confident that your block will remain on the chain. Others recommend an even longer wait, if the payment made to you is sizable. Thus, rather than waiting ten minutes, to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours. Some people have suggested making the crypto puzzles easier in order to speed up the process, for instance by making it possible to find a solution every minute, rather than every 10 minutes. However, by doing so, the probability of getting two solutions within a few seconds of each other increases significantly. The system can cope with an occasional soft fork, but not with very frequent forks. Expenses, slowness, and uncertainty are indeed major flaws in the proof-of-work approach, but they pale in comparison with its fatal flaw. *The Fatal Flaw in Proof-of-Work.* Recall the already discussed fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* In proof-of-work, this small part of the economy is that owned by the miners. Since the miners own only a small fraction of the money in a proof-of-work blockchain, the chain is not secure. ***Delegated Proof-of-Stake*** A different approach is delegated proof-of-stake (PoS). This is a very simple idea. The community empowers a few special users, the *delegates*, to choose the next block, at least for a while. (For example, in EOS, the number of the delegates is 21.) Delegated PoS is, therefore, centralized from the get-go. Hopefully, the chosen delegates are honest to begin with. However, relying on delegates remaining honest for a long time is risky. Once again, we have that *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a delegated-PoS blockchain the delegates may own a tiny fraction of the total money in the system, yet the whole blockchain is secure if and only if the majority of delegates are honest. *Additional Security Problems.* Even assuming that there is an ironclad guarantee that all the delegates will remain honest forever, they can easily be attacked. In particular, they can be brought down by a denial of service (DoS) attack. In such an attack, an adversary bombards any user of his choice with zillions of junk messages, causing the buffer of that unfortunate user to overflow. If a delegate were so bombarded, he would be unable to perform his job, namely collating new and valid transactions into the next block. The blockchain would grind to a halt. DoS attacks are quite cheap and can be mounted instantly against not only 21 people but even 1000 people. Since delegates are known, even if they were kept in power for just a day or an hour or a minute, a determined adversary could bring down all the delegates by a fast DoS attack. ***Bonded Proof-of-Stake*** Bonded PoS allows 20 users, 200 users, as many as are willing, to put some money on the table ‚Äî a bond ‚Äî where they can no longer touch it. These are the users who select the next block on behalf of all of us. If they misbehave, their money is confiscated. Does this approach work? Let me ask a simpler question: how much of your disposable income can you afford to put hostage on the table? The answer is a very small amount. Bonded PoS therefore, not only makes it possible, but actually makes it *easy* for big thieves with deep pockets to put a disproportionate amount of money on the table for the sole purpose of controlling the blockchain. But so what? If they misbehave, they lose their hostage money. However, a truly decentralized, scalable and secure blockchain should secure trillions of dollars in assets. And by misbehaving, a malicious user stands to make a few billion dollars. This being the case, do you think that he may fear having a few million dollars confiscated? This is just the price of doing business. And it is a small price at that. Once more, in bonded PoS, we have the same fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a bonded PoS this small part of the economy consists of (the owners of) ‚Äúthe money laying hostage on the table.‚Äù In sum, prior approaches suffer from several drawbacks. We need a better design. **Algorand‚Äôs Logic and Pure Proof-of-Stake.** Algorand‚Äôs logic is simple: it ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the *majority* of the economy, and makes it impossible for a small subset of the economy to control the fate of the whole economy. Algorand is based on a new Proof-of-Stake: *Pure* *PoS*. Essentially, a Pure PoS does not try to keep users honest by the fear of imposing fines. Rather, it makes cheating by a minority of the money impossible and cheating by a majority of the money stupid. In Algorand no money is ever hostage. All money is always where it should be: in your wallet, at your fingertips ready to be spent, or in the various financial instruments that the Algorand blockchain offers you. When you take in consideration all the money in the system, wherever it may be, the system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands. As we said, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be silly for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave so as to devalue their own holdings. For example, in proof-of-work or bonded PoS, a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, only the owners of the majority of the money could prevent other users from transacting. But if they did so, the reputation of the currency would be greatly harmed, the currency would no longer universally accepted, and its purchasing power would be greatly diminished. Not a good outcome for the owners of the majority of the money. **Implementing Pure PoS.** Let us now see how Algorand uses pure PoS for choosing the next block. Remember the trilemma? We want block generation to be simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized. At a very high level, in Algorand, a new block is constructed in two phases. * In the first phase, a single token is randomly selected, and its owner is the user who proposes the next block. * In the second phase, 1000 tokens are selected among all tokens currently in the system. The owners of these 1000 tokens are selected to be part of a phase-2 ‚Äòcommittee,‚Äô which approves the block proposed by the first user. Accordingly, some member of the committee may be chosen twice or more generally some k times, in which case, that member will have k votes in the committee to approve the next block. Why is the second phase necessary? In any society, and blockchains are no exception, there is always a small percentage of bad actors to be found; let us say 1 percent. Maybe 2 percent. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a very dangerous society, 10 percent may be bad actors. Perhaps even 20 percent! But in no society will bad actors be in a majority; otherwise, there would not be a society. A society exists insofar as the majority of its members follow prescribed rules. Assume that 10 percent of the tokens in Algorand belong to dishonest people. Then, one in ten times, the user selected in phase 1 to propose a block may be a bad actor. Accordingly, he may tell some users that the block is X and other users that the block is Y and so on and so forth, thereby creating disagreement about what the blockchain is. Phase 2 eliminates this problem. Indeed, if you select at random 1000 tokens when at most 10 percent of the tokens are in dishonest hands, the probability that the majority of the selected coins belong to bad actors, that is, the probability that the majority of the committee‚Äôs votes are cast by bad actors is so low as to be negligible. Assume that, this time around, you have not been selected to propose a block. Nor have you been selected to be part of a committee to approve a proposed block. But you see that a given block B has been approved by, say, 700 votes of the committee. Then, you know that B is indeed the next block. **A Key Question.** At this high-level description, several questions naturally arise. Let us start with the most obvious one: *Who randomly chooses the committee?* Suppose I tell you that I do. Then you might say ‚ÄúThat is the most centralized system ever, and you are at the center of it!‚Äù Suppose I tell you that all users discuss until they agree on a thousand committee members who then agree on the block. Then you might tell me that, humanity being what it is, an entire lifetime is not going to be enough to select the thousand committee members that we require. Algorand takes an unorthodox approach: *the committee members select themselves.* You may think ‚ÄúWhat? That is a terrible idea! Because if I am a bad actor, I am going to select myself to be a member of this committee. And the next. And the one after that‚Ä¶‚Äù But not so fast. To belong to the committee, one of your coins must win an individual, cryptographically fair lottery that you run in isolation ‚Äî that is, without talking to anyone else ‚Äî in the privacy of your own computer. And since the lottery is cryptographically fair, you cannot alter the chances of being selected in the slightest. (Not even a nation state with huge computational resources would be able to increase the probability of being selected.) To select 1,000 random tokens among, say, 10,000,000,000 tokens, each token is selected with probability 1,000/10,000,000,000 ‚Äî i.e., with probability 1 in 10 million. So, as soon as a user sees a block being proposed, she asks herself: can I be a member of the committee selected to approve a block? And how many votes will I have? To answer these questions, she runs the cryptographic lottery on her laptop for each one of the tokens that she owns. (If a user has n tokens, additional technology essentially allows her to run a single lottery instead of n separate lotteries!) Once a user runs her lottery, one of two cases occurs. Either none of her tokens wins the lottery, in which case whatever opinion she expresses about the block will be ignored. Or some k>1of her tokens win the lottery, in which case, she obtains a winning ticket, namely a short proof that everybody can easily verify that she has k votes in the committee. In this latter case, she propagates through the network (i) a winning ticket proving that she has k votes and (ii) her opinion about the block. **Solving the Trilemma**. Let me argue that this sketched approach is ‚Äî finally! ‚Äî simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized. *Scalability.* How long does it take for a user to run her own lottery? Roughly a microsecond, no matter how many tokens she has. That is indeed superfast. (Additionally, all the lotteries are run independently of each other, so that no user has to wait for other users to finish running their lotteries.) Once selected, each member propagates to the network a single, short and immediately computed message. So no matter how many users are in the system, the maximum number of messages that need to be propagated is 1000 short messages. Is this scalable? Yes! *Security.* Now we come to security. Assume that I am a very powerful adversary, capable of corrupting users extremely quickly whenever I want. Clearly, I would love to corrupt the members of the committee, but I have a problem: I do not know who they are. This is so because committee members are selected by a secretly run, cryptographically fair, individual lottery. Thus, only they know who they are, up to the moment in which they propagate through the network both their winning tickets and their opinions about the block. Only at that time I might learn who the committee members are and, given my super powers, I can immediately corrupt the entire committee. But so what? Corrupting them at this time is too late. Whatever the committee members had to say, they have already said, and their winning tickets and up-or-down opinions about the block are virally propagating throughout the network. I have no more power to put their messages back in the bottle than a government has the power to put back in the bottle messages virally propagated by WikiLeaks. In other words, the Algorand approach is secure because beforehand, an adversary does not know whom to corrupt, and by the time he does, corruption is useless. Contrast this with having a fixed 1000-strong committee. As discussed before, even if the committee stayed in power for a minute, it would be vulnerable to a DoS attack. If the committee stayed in power for much longer, say a week, then the members could even be corrupted in the physical world via traditional means such as bribes. In Algorand‚Äôs case however, one would not know against whom to mount a DoS attack and once the committee has spoken, the DoS attack is useless. *Decentralization.* Finally, we come to decentralization. Are there a few users in charge of choosing the next block? No, there are not. Nor is there a fixed, 1000-strong, committee in charge of approving the block. This time, a committee has been randomly (and secretly) selected. Next time, a different committee will be randomly (and secretly) selected. Everybody has the chance of participating in the generation of a new block. *Algorand‚Äôs Non-Forkable Chain.* An additional advantage of Algorand‚Äôs technology is that its chain never forks. This is so because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. Accordingly, in Algorand all transactions are final. Once a block appears, you can count on it to be forever part of the chain. And if the new block contains a payment made to you, you may consider yourself paid and send the goods immediately. The financial world has already its own risks and there is no need to burden it with the additional uncertainty of \`block disappearance.‚Äô By the way, when I said that Algorand‚Äôs chain never forks, I somewhat lied. Indeed, forks may occur in Algorand but they are very rare. The probability of forking in Algorand is, by design, 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∏. This probability may appear a strange choice, but it actually has a natural explanation. Physicists tell us that 10¬π‚Å∏ happens to be the number of seconds from the Big Bang until now. In other words, if you produce a block a second, a very good clip by the way, you may see a soft fork, but you would have to wait for the lifetime of the universe to see it."

Out of 17 predictions analyzed, 15 were wrong, 1 was partially correct, and only 1 was fully accurate. [Link to the video is **here**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FId5Ji-Tw0E) I don't want to waste anyone's time (+ ADHD here) so I'll get right into it. **METHODOLOGY** I made a spreadsheet ([available here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uglm1iXVYqLXjYGah6_co7agDBlXK4i7ZuMC6aZrHaE/edit?usp=sharing)) where I kept track of Ben's exact statements and predictions regarding Bitcoin (price and dominance), Ethereum, and altcoins. The idea behind it wasn't to publish this or make a video about it - it was to use it for my own sanity, because I felt many of his predictions fell short, but could never point my finger as to why. I focused on predictions made in 2023 for fair evaluation, since some need months/years to play out. Then, I methodically checked each prediction against actual market performance and noted if it panned out or not. I made a video about it because, honestly, it's easier and faster to follow than clicking on each link in the spreadsheet. I'm not a youtuber, I don't need your subs, and this is the only video I'll ever publish. I just want to inform you. **CONCLUSIONS** Out of 17 statements that I followed up on, 15 ended up not panning out. 1 was partially correct, and another one was fully correct. Ben's predictions missed on the timing component, the value component, or both (in most cases). I won't go into specific statements - you have either the spreadsheet or the video to take a look at. **TAKEAWAY** In the end, this isn't about Ben at all. It's about EVERY YouTube and X crypto personality you follow. Here's the critical advice: * Document EXACT statements - when an influencer makes a prediction, write down the EXACT words, including specific price targets, time frames, and conditions. * Beware of narrative shifting - many influencers have a habit of slowly tweaking their narrative. They'll subtly modify their original statement over time so that when something eventually happens, they can claim they ""predicted"" it. * Time and value matter - a prediction isn't just about being right eventually. The specific time frame and exact value are crucial. If someone predicts Bitcoin will hit $100k ""sometime in the future"", that's not a real prediction. Start a spreadsheet. Track the precise claims. Compare them to actual market performance. You'll be shocked how often ""expert"" predictions fall apart under scrutiny. Bottom Line: Do your own research. Be critical. Don't worship any single crypto influencer, no matter how popular they are."

On the other hand, the arguments for bitcoin tend to be well reasoned and have substance. The contrast is stark to someone who only cares about logic. Of course, the news articles play on these name calling tactics in more of a subtle, ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù way to give the appearance of a substantive argument, when there is none. I guess I‚Äôm just floored by how many people are fooled by this, and how rarely people use logical reasoning or critical thinking for themselves, despite all the lip service that is paid to ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù. Even people that appear intelligent because they have a large vocabulary, good rhetorical skills, are charismatic, etc, really can‚Äôt think logically. The best they can do is parrot an argument made by someone else. Sometimes I‚Äôm jealous because I‚Äôve never been able to do this convincingly. Just wanted to share this observation. Guess it‚Äôs not new to me because, by teaching math to college students, I witness how many people are just not able to reason for themselves, and instead rely on other tactics, like associations, memorization, cheating (lol) to get by.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons. 1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!** # ""Why was Pepecoin created?"" The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto. The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract. From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw. We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority. # Mining Rewards |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000| # Inflation Rate Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact. # Official Communities * Reddit: [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord) # Reddit Tip Bot Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

I want you to send this to them. The costs of printing U.S. dollars involve multiple layers, including material costs, operational costs, labor, security, and transportation. Here's a breakdown of the known variables and their approximate contributions: # Material Costs * **Paper**: U.S. currency is printed on a special blend of 75% cotton and 25% linen paper. * **Ink and Dyes**: Currency uses specialized inks, including color-shifting ink for security features. * **Holograms and Security Threads**: Features like watermarks and microprinting add to the cost. *Approximate Costs*: Around **$0.08 to $0.13 per note** for materials alone. This is just the cost to produce a single bank note of varying denominations. THis does not include the below costs ive outlined. # Printing Machinery * **Machines**: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) uses high-tech presses that are expensive to purchase, maintain, and operate. * **Maintenance and Upgrades**: Ongoing servicing of these machines is essential. *Annual Costs*: Estimated **tens of millions of dollars**, depending on production levels and upgrades # Labor * Skilled labor includes designers, press operators, inspectors, and administrative staff. * BEP employs approximately 2,000 people across its facilities in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas. *Labor Costs*: Estimated at **hundreds of millions annually**, as the BEP's total operational budget (including labor and materials) for producing currency is around **$1 billion annually**. I mean someone needs to do the physical work and we need to pay them for it. There is also their healthcare coverage and other expendables that go into their exitance as workers at the facility. # Security * **Guards**: The BEP contracts armed guards and uses advanced surveillance systems. * **Transportation**: Secure trucks and police escorts are used to move currency. * **Insurance**: Covers risks during production and transportation. *Security Costs*: Not explicitly broken out but a significant portion of the BEP's budget. Security can be either from a private inhouse or subcontracting company so the costs for this can vary but lets say security is provided by itself of the BEP in all stages. They can run up the charge reducing its overhead in the year end so again not only do they print money out of thin air but they can out of thin air, create there own costs of operation. # Waste Management (everything is poop) * **Abatement**: Disposing of waste ink, defective notes, and other by-products must comply with strict environmental regulations. * **Recycling**: Some waste materials, like paper, may be recycled into products like insulation. *Estimated Costs*: **Millions annually**, depending on waste volume and disposal methods. # Transportation * **Vehicles**: Armored vehicles equipped with GPS tracking. * **Permits and Escorts**: Required for high-security transport across states. *Estimated Costs*: **Tens of millions annually**. # Utilities and Overheads * **Electricity**: High energy consumption for lighting, machines, and climate-controlled environments. * **Water**: Used for cooling machinery and cleaning. *Utility Costs*: **Tens of millions annually**. The more they print, the more they work err-go the more it costs. # Total Approximate Costs The BEP estimates the cost of printing currency at **$0.07 to $0.15 per note**, depending on the denomination and security features. The total annual cost of printing currency (all denominations) is in the range of **$800 million to $1 billion**. Now lets not forget what happened in 2023 * **Volume of Production**: In 2023, the BEP produced approximately 7.6 billion notes. * **Inflation of Operational Costs**: Rising material and labor costs can increase expenses. For more precise numbers, the BEP's annual reports provide detailed financial breakdowns, **though specific security-related expenses are often classified**. Let say we wanted to ESTIMATE the grand total of all costs involved in printing the USD. We can find the number to be around $1.5 Billion ANNUALLY. This does not factor in how much money it takes to DESTROY money. The total cost falls between **$1.15 billion and $1.95 billion annually**, with **$1.5 billion** being a reasonable mid-range estimate. This estimate is based on publicly available data from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) and does not account for classified security expenses, which may add additional costs."

I‚Äôm the kind of person you‚Äôd label *that insane schizo conspiracy theorist*. The one you‚Äôd laugh at, mock in group chats, or call delusional in Reddit threads. That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm used to it. But here‚Äôs the thing about ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù people‚Äîthey‚Äôre often the first to see patterns others ignore. So laugh all you want, but in a few years, when the dust settles, I‚Äôll be the one saying, ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù What am I talking about? Bitcoin. The dollar. Wealth inequality. The future of money. Let me show you a blueprint for a system that‚Äôs being built right in front of your eyes‚Äîone that most of you either don‚Äôt see or refuse to believe. You‚Äôll probably roll your eyes and call me crazy, but remember this moment when it all starts happening. # Bitcoin‚Äôs Origins: A Perfectly Timed ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù Let‚Äôs start with Bitcoin‚Äôs origin story. It‚Äôs 2008‚Äîthe financial crisis has shattered trust in banks and governments. Amid this chaos, a pseudonymous figure named Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin white paper, promising a decentralized, deflationary currency immune to manipulation. People eat it up. It‚Äôs the ultimate middle finger to the establishment, right? But let‚Äôs think critically here. **How convenient is it that Bitcoin emerged precisely when global trust in centralized systems was at an all-time low?** Too convenient. Timing matters, and the timing of Bitcoin‚Äôs release feels less like a coincidence and more like an engineered response. And let‚Äôs not ignore Bitcoin‚Äôs technological roots. The SHA-256 algorithm, which secures Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, was developed by the NSA. While SHA-256 is open-source and widely used, it‚Äôs not a stretch to suggest the U.S. government may have had a hand in shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs foundations. After all, who benefits most from a digital, transparent, and traceable financial system? (Yes, I said traceable‚Äîbecause don‚Äôt let anyone fool you into thinking Bitcoin is truly anonymous. It‚Äôs pseudonymous, and every transaction is permanently etched onto a public ledger.) If you‚Äôre still with me, here‚Äôs the kicker: The U.S. government didn‚Äôt need to announce Bitcoin as their creation. They let it grow organically, fueled by libertarian ideals and distrust in the system. They knew people would adopt it out of rebellion, unknowingly building the infrastructure for the very financial surveillance system they feared. # Proof of Adoption: The Quiet Infiltration by the Elite Now, let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs happened since. Bitcoin, once a niche experiment for tech enthusiasts, has grown into a trillion-dollar asset class. And here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: the very institutions Bitcoin was supposed to undermine are now its biggest backers. * **BlackRock**: The world‚Äôs largest asset manager, with deep ties to governments and central banks, has been filing for Bitcoin ETFs and pushing institutional adoption. Fun fact: BlackRock‚Äôs CEO, Larry Fink, was once critical of Bitcoin, calling it a tool for money laundering. Now? He‚Äôs all-in. Ask yourself: why the sudden 180-degree shift? * **MicroStrategy**: Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has been one of Bitcoin‚Äôs loudest advocates, investing billions of corporate funds into BTC. This isn‚Äôt just a corporate strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs part of a larger trend of institutions quietly accumulating Bitcoin while the average person hesitates. * **Fidelity and Other Financial Giants**: Companies like Fidelity have been laying the groundwork for institutional Bitcoin adoption for years. These firms don‚Äôt make moves without inside knowledge or government alignment. The narrative is clear: **Bitcoin is no longer the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs currency.‚Äù** It‚Äôs being hoarded by the same elite entities that control traditional finance. And if you think governments aren‚Äôt involved, you‚Äôre kidding yourself. They‚Äôre just letting their proxies‚Äîcompanies like BlackRock‚Äîdo the dirty work. # Why the U.S. Government Needs Bitcoin Here‚Äôs where the puzzle pieces really come together. The U.S. dollar is in decline. Inflation is eroding its value, national debt is skyrocketing, and global rivals like China and Russia are pushing for alternatives. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are even developing their own reserve currency to challenge the dollar‚Äôs dominance. The U.S. government knows this. They know the dollar‚Äôs days as the global reserve currency are numbered. And what‚Äôs the best way to transition out of a failing system? **Control the replacement before your rivals do.** Bitcoin offers a solution: 1. **Deflationary Economics**: With its fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation. This makes it an attractive reserve asset for nations and institutions. 2. **Global Neutrality**: Bitcoin isn‚Äôt tied to any one country, making it a perfect candidate for a new global financial system‚Äîone that the U.S. can influence quietly through early accumulation. 3. **Debt Reset Potential**: If Bitcoin‚Äôs value skyrockets (say, to $1 million or more per coin), governments holding large reserves could sell portions to pay off national debt or fund programs. It‚Äôs a clean slate for a broken system. # The Trap of Bitcoin ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù But here‚Äôs the kicker: while Bitcoin appears to promise financial freedom, it‚Äôs also a Trojan Horse for unprecedented control. Governments aren‚Äôt just sitting idly by‚Äîthey‚Äôre developing **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** to complement or even compete with Bitcoin. These CBDCs will: * Be programmable, meaning governments can control how you spend your money. * Be trackable, erasing any semblance of financial privacy. * Tie directly to social systems, potentially linking your finances to things like credit scores or even social behavior. Here‚Äôs the twisted beauty of it: Bitcoin will pave the way for mass adoption of digital currencies. Once people are comfortable with Bitcoin, governments will step in with CBDCs, offering stability and convenience. And by then, it‚Äôll be too late. You‚Äôll already be trapped in the system. # Wealth Inequality and the New World Order Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat this: Bitcoin will make some people unimaginably rich. But who benefits most? Early adopters and institutions. The average person, who buys in late or doesn‚Äôt buy at all, will be left behind. This isn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit‚Äôs by design. When fiat currencies collapse and Bitcoin takes center stage, the wealth divide will become unbridgeable. The elites will hold Bitcoin, land, and other hard assets. The rest? They‚Äôll own depreciating fiat and worthless debt. This isn‚Äôt just financial inequality‚Äîit‚Äôs systemic anarchy, a world where power consolidates further into the hands of the few. # But I Know What You‚Äôre Thinking‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSchizo ramblings,‚Äù right? ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs insane.‚Äù Sure. Laugh it up. Call me crazy. But just remember: every major upheaval in history was dismissed as impossible until it happened. People laughed at those who warned about the 2008 financial crisis. They laughed at Snowden‚Äôs revelations about mass surveillance. And they‚Äôre laughing now at the idea that Bitcoin is anything other than a benevolent invention. But when you‚Äôre watching Bitcoin hit seven figures, when the dollar is collapsing, and when governments are rolling out CBDCs with a smile, just remember this post. I‚Äôll be back to say, ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù # One Final Thought You don‚Äôt have to believe me. In fact, I don‚Äôt expect you to. But start asking questions. Why are institutions hoarding Bitcoin? Why are governments tolerating something that supposedly threatens their power? And why is a system built on ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù being quietly co-opted by the very entities it was meant to replace? Think critically. Connect the dots. And when the pieces fall into place, just remember: you heard it here first."

I'll start with myself and my crypto journey. I first came across bitcoin in the 2017 hype cycle and was swing trading. After little success I converted to being a passive long term investor. My mantra became time in the market rather than timing the market. I invested in btc and many of the largest cap alts periodically. As time went on it seemed that bitcoin was the only one performing long term. Most alts suffered enormous losses when everything crashed. So did btc, but it recovered well. As I continued to learn about economics it's become clear to me the bitcoin is the best play by far. At this stage I'm only buying btc and a little eth. I've been gradually selling most of my long term held alts. It pains me to say that I sold doge and xrp probably way too early, midway through their recent runs. I also sold some smaller alt positions before things took off recently and rebalanced them to bitcoin. The alts I've exited were not much of my portfolio but the fomo is real. That said I'm going to continue selling all of them except for btc, eth, sol and maybe bnb as these are my long term plays (again most of this is btc and I'll always continue to stack sats). What gives me comfort is that I'm happy to hodl btc as I strongly believe in it, when it crashes I see this as an opportunity. My allocation is currently about 85% btc, 10% eth, 2% sol and bnb each and 1% a handful of others. What about you?"

My $2000 went down to $1000 so I had to sell! if only I didnt it would have been worth 2.3mil! Do you think these people would have sold if Shib went up in only a straight line? \----- The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments. An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded. It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.

There is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs ""Chads"", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach. We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat. Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU https://preview.redd.it/rfeng5dtpx3e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=c65897680492dacb99635af44a130f223a8426bf We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction. This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams. We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

But hey looks like we could send our currency to another account.. So we decided to send it to a coinbase account we had, that was empty. Unfortunately, me being new thought to get the address i choose the company that is sending it, not the currency itself so I chose something called binanceus. I started the transaction, but something came up and my wife finished it. Turns out we sent XRP from binance, whom had to wrap it (wrapped xrp) because it was going to a different network. Well Coinbase doesnt deal with wrapped xrp, and said they cannot send it back as they dont deal with this kind of currency, binance also cannot help as its out of their establishment already. Coinbase did say that if they eventually accept wrapped xrp it will show up in our account. Is there any other way to get this back or a we just screwed? thanks."

BTC mining and renewables,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h46cr9/btc_mining_and_renewables/,,0,0.5,0,ah__there_is_another,1733068719.0,"Bitcoin, Solar, RAMP","The argument that Bitcoin mining helps incentivize renewable energy development rests on the unique characteristics of BTC mining and the challenges of renewable energy production. Key Points of the Argument 1. Renewable Energy is Often Overproduced Many renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, produce electricity intermittently and sometimes generate more power than the grid can use or store during peak production times. For instance, during a sunny or windy day, energy production might exceed local demand, leading to curtailment (wasted energy). 2. BTC Mining is Location and Time Agnostic Bitcoin mining can be done anywhere with cheap electricity, and miners can ramp up or down their operations quickly. This makes it an ideal ""energy buyer of last resort."" Miners are willing to buy electricity that would otherwise go unused, often at a discounted rate. 3. Incentivizing Renewable Energy Investment By providing a guaranteed buyer for surplus energy, BTC mining can make renewable energy projects more financially viable. For example: A solar farm in a remote area might not be connected to a grid with high enough demand to justify its cost. BTC miners can set up nearby to consume and monetize the excess power. This extra income stream from mining reduces the risk and improves the return on investment for renewable energy developers. 4. Promoting Grid Stability Renewables can cause grid instability due to their variability. Bitcoin miners, as flexible energy consumers, can help balance the grid. During periods of high renewable output, miners increase consumption. When demand from other users rises, miners can scale down operations to free up energy for the grid. 5. Driving Innovation in Energy Storage and Distribution The presence of BTC mining operations might encourage further innovation in energy storage and transmission technologies. As mining grows, the incentive to develop cost-effective ways to store and transport renewable energy increases. Counterarguments to Consider While the argument is compelling, critics raise valid concerns: Environmental Impact: BTC mining still consumes large amounts of energy, and in regions where fossil fuels dominate, it can indirectly support non-renewable energy use. Opportunity Costs: The resources used for mining could arguably be better spent on other technologies, like energy storage or efficiency improvements. Economic Viability Without Subsidies: Some question whether mining alone can consistently provide enough economic incentive to justify renewable projects without additional subsidies or regulatory support. Examples Iceland and Hydropower: In Iceland, Bitcoin miners tap into abundant and cheap geothermal and hydropower energy, which otherwise might not have been fully utilized. Texas and Wind Power: In the U.S., Bitcoin mining operations have partnered with renewable energy producers to use excess wind and solar power during off-peak hours. This synergy between Bitcoin mining and renewable energy could play a role in transitioning to a more sustainable energy system, provided it's managed responsibly. PS. AI generated, but I found it useful, so thought I'd share."

Ease of Token Creation: Clanker simplifies the process of token creation to the point where it's accessible to anyone with basic social media skills. Users can deploy tokens by simply tagging Clanker on the Farcaster platform, describing their desired token, thereby lowering the entry barriers for token creators and potentially attracting a broader user base to the Base ecosystem. 2. Community Engagement and Viral Potential: The integration of token deployment with social media platforms like Farcaster encourages community participation. Memes and viral content can naturally lead to increased attention and, consequently, adoption. Clanker's tokens often become memes themselves, which can drive speculative interest and trading volume, furthering the network's visibility 3. Profit Sharing Mechanism: Clanker's model includes sharing a portion of the fees with the users who request token deployments. This financial incentive could encourage more people to use Clanker for launching tokens, thus increasing activity on Base. The promise of earning from the liquidity pool fees makes it an attractive proposition for users looking to participate in the crypto space in a potentially profitable manner. 4. Innovation in Tokenomics: By introducing tokens like LUM, which were autonomously created through AI collaboration, Clanker showcases innovative tokenomics. This not only promotes the idea of AI in blockchain but also piques interest in how tokens can be generated, possibly drawing tech enthusiasts and investors curious about new token models. 5. Fostering Decentralized Social Interaction: Clanker's operation within the Farcaster ecosystem highlights how blockchain can intersect with decentralized social networks. This intersection can lead to new forms of interaction and economic models where social engagement directly correlates with token creation, potentially making Base a hub for such activities. 6. Market Activity Boost: The surge in transaction volumes due to Clanker's activity indicates its substantial impact on the network's activity. High transaction volumes often correlate with increased interest and investment in a blockchain, which could lead to greater adoption as more participants are drawn to where the action is. Is obvous this could attract adoption for the base blockchain especially as many degen have also start speculating that the next top memecoin will come from either base chain or Sui but what do you think?

As a result of this cyclic investment into BTC, the alts and meme coins also benefit with a new surge of capital, and it's sustained by the speculative investment that these cryptos will be institutionally adopted or gain real world utility and reflect their actual $ value in use-case one day. Everyone is now elated because they've 100x'd their portfolios, look at all the cryptos in their wallet, still having no idea what they actually do and decide it's time to cash out. Those who timed it right make out like bandits and the majority are left holding their near worthless bags until the next cycle. The market tanks and crabs for 3 years because at some point the speculative bubble bursts when everyone wakes up and realizes there's still no real-world adoption or use-case for any of this that affects 90% of the population outside of talking about it on subreddits and niche programmers in their sandbox. This happens every 4 years as a self-fulfilling prophecy and I don't know whether this year to believe it will be any different or we might actually see crypto become integrated in our day-to-day and partially break free from the 3 years of crab market until the prophecy is fulfilled like the Halley's Comet hopium we've been surviving off."

Whether it's Michael Saylor via Microstrategy, or others via Coinbase, Goldman Sachs or Blackrock, which I am very sure handles massive purchases for their clients. My question is, are the days of the wealthy (or anyone) building a large BTC position with anonymity, over? Correct me if I am wrong, but if someone buys through any regulated intermediary (Coinbase, brokerage firm, etc), the KYC will leave a paper trail of ownership by name and reporting that info to the IRS and government is required. It also seems that if someone wished to buy $10M of Bitcoin via some un-regulated international entity, there would be higher counterparty risks that dissuade the individual from doing so. Satoshi and those whose work he built on, included ""semi-anonymity"" into Bitcoin for a reason. You could see the wallets but not the real names. Not having a trusted intermediary was not just a feature, it was a benefit. Obviously this was their wish, since we still have no idea who Satoshi even is fifteen years later. When one sells BTC for a profit, the IRS in form 8949 asks for data on the original purchase and sale. But the IRS does not ask whether one owns BTC individually until a sale. At least.... so far. Just watch, that will change, I assure you. So.... are the days of individuals purchasing large sums of BTC without government knowing exactly who they are and how much they have.....over?"

Sound advice, right? It emphasizes the risk of the market and the importance of not overextending yourself financially. But here's a thought I‚Äôve been reflecting on, especially as we navigate another cycle of bull market hype: many people who believe in Bitcoin still try to time the market. They plan to sell at the top, wait for the dip, and buy back in, hoping to accumulate more BTC. While taking profits is reasonable, it carries significant risks. Here‚Äôs the quote I find more useful: ‚ÄúSell only what you can afford to lose‚Äù‚Äîand I mean this in Bitcoin terms. If you sell your BTC, there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll be able to buy back at a lower price. The market might run away from you, and you could end up buying back fewer BTC for the same or higher cost. In trying to optimize your stack, you could lose part of it altogether. This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but more of a mindset shift I‚Äôve been embracing. If you believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value, think carefully before parting with your sats. Sometimes, the best move is simply holding on for the ride. What are your thoughts? Does this resonate, or do you still try to time the market?"

It‚Äôs from 2013, launched days after Dogecoin and was meant to be the cat counter part to the first dog coin launched. Understanding that Dogecoin took off because of the memeability of DOGE, it seems like the cat version (while not as meme able), should have some for historic value? The first cat coin ever launched, the counter part to Dogecoin, all seem like strong narratives, especially in todays world of thousands of terrible meme coins being launched a day. History seems to be a constant in holding value, Dogecoin, CryptoPunks, EtherRocks, etc. I can‚Äôt figure out why it only has a $10M market cap? Dogecoin has a market cap of $62B. A coin as old as Dogecoin, that is the cat counter part shouldn‚Äôt least have a 1/100 value, which is a 62x. To me, it seems reasonable to have at least 1/10 the value, which is then a x620. Maybe there is something in the history which is why it never gained popularity? I bought a small amount, as a collector of historic ‚Äúfirst‚Äù tokens. The cat version of Dogecoin with the same historic provenance seems worth a gamble to me. Their twitter is CatcoinOfficial. Kind of hard to buy at the moment (only one exchange), but there is always rewards to those that buy before it gets on the ‚Äúbigger and easier‚Äù exchanges."

The majority of people have essentially argued that Bitcoin is a store of value. Fiat down, Bitcoin up. Isn‚Äôt that the same as any other asset? People are comparing Bitcoin to gold, but gold has been proven to not only be a bad store of value, but also a terrible asset. What makes Bitcoin a better investment choice than an asset that actually produces something? As a store of value, I also take objection. Its history to date has shown that it‚Äôs NOT a good store of value as tomorrow it might be worth half what I paid for it. For a non producing asset to increase in value that assets demand must increase. So, the argument seems to be that demand for Bitcoin will always increase because all alternative investments will be unable to match its ability to both store value and appreciate over time. Is that about right? I don‚Äôt disagree that fiat currency is a BAD investment. Holding dollars long term is a guaranteed loser. I also agree that Bitcoin will benefit from being first.

Bitcoin and all of crypto is actually a software technology called ""blockchain"" Everything you do on the internet requires a protocol. Examples are Videos (Mp4 is the protocol) audio (Mp3 is the protocol) Every link you click that directs you somewhere online is another protocol. Bitcoin and crypto is another protocol layer ontop of everything. Why that is important is because of the transfer of data. Currently we live in a 1to1 (one piece of data at a time) Imagine I'm giving you a bottle of water. I can either hand you 1 bottle at a time. Or a whole case, or a whole pallet, or a whole truck load at a time. That's essentially what blockchain (all of crypto) does. The more people that are on the planet. The more data you're going to use and the faster you need that data to transfer This is just one of the problems bitcoin and crypto solves. To keep things simple without going crazy with too much to read for ya I'll say this Bitcoin is like digital gold Ethereum is like digital Oil (literally needed for every crypto transaction) That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's literally 1,000's more crypto with use cases all over the board from infrastructure to banking to governments already using them including brics nation and India using xrp ripple for all oil transactions (oil is in the cars, it's cooking oil, it's used in all polyester fabrics). Feel free to ask any questions. I'm here to help. I've been in the space for about 3 years myself and the community is tremendous and filled with a lot of really smart talented people. Let's help each other. To find the right crypto you wanna be looking at infrastructure. For instance currently in this cycle. These are some of the top crypto to buy right now. Gaming , RWA (real world assets), Ai, Dpin. (Everyone feel free to add your best picks with supporting reasons) For those who are new. To start What you do is go download 2 apps. Coinmarketcap.com And Crypto Bubbles Use both of these with each other Crypto bubbles gives you price analysis And on Coinmarketcap you can sort projects by category. Crypto Bubbles will show you yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly. On any one particular project If it's more green than red across the board then it's worth looking further into. The higher percentage the better. When in doubt zoom out (Learn your Crypto lingo) When you're looking for something good it's best to find something that's up for the year. Then the month and week. Bitcoin moves 1st then Ethereum then everything else. Their will be day long periods of everything needing to catch up. Sometimes weeks or months. (Whats everyone's experience with this?) Here's a tip. All prices will fluctuate. When bitcoin goes down and you start seeing a lot of red. Use crypto bubbles and watch what recovers on the hour and daily the fastest. This usually indicates a strong project with more potential. Making it worth looking into further. Using coinmarketcap you can find the project's main webpage and do research on who owns the company, how strong the community is on different platforms, how many developers they have, who their partners are. Etc. *************************** *************************** The name of the game is doing your own research. Know who and what you're spending your hard earned money on regardless of what other people say. *************************** *************************** If anyone has anything to add to this let's grow and educate each other. This community is smart and strong. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Add resources. Which influencers do you follow. What websites do you use and why. What charts do you recommend.

I want you to think back to what everyone was saying about touch screen cell phones, the internet, self driving cars, Uber just to name a few. I had someone tell me investing in crypto is like gambling on the digital horse races. Everything in life is a gamble. There's no guarantee on anything except death and meeting God. Sure prices fluctuate. Everything does. You fill up your gas tank just to drive, empty it then fill it back up. You work, get money then are forced to pay bills so you go work some more and start the process all over again. Everyone is pointing out the obvious of the prices fluctuating so much. But what do you think your bank account does? People might be broke but they're still buying Starbucks and McDonald's when they're hungry instead of investing. At least with investing you can learn to make your money work for you. Its Absolutely no different than buying lotto or investing in traditional stock markets. And how many people still do it? Hell even in the hourse races you should still do research on the horse you're betting on. Why should it be any different when investing? Whether it's stock or crypto or anything else? When you buy a house, don't you go research the reality company? Don't you go find out what the neighborhood is like? Dont you request a viewing of the property? When you buy any kind of insurance (Life, Medical, renter's, Car). Don't you compare rates? So tell me why should it be any different when investing? It shouldn't really matter what it is. You insure everything else. Why wouldn't you insure your money? Crypto isn't just currency. It has actual use cases. These crypto companies are actually at its core just software companies Just don't be stupid with it. If you're smart with it and learn proper risk management. Learn the cycles and how to find entry and exit points **************** Here's a task for anyone skeptical. Go search up on Google what the average APY/ APR is for a credit card and a savings account. Then go look up the numbers these crypto's are doing in a days/weeks/month's time. Do your own research. Then tell me I'm wrong. I promise you I'm right ***********"

These services include decentralized lending and borrowing, staking, and yield farming, allowing users to maximize the potential of their MANTRA tokens by earning additional rewards or lending them for a fee. In a world where governments and central banks are tightening control over traditional financial systems, cryptocurrencies like MANTRA provide a powerful alternative, giving individuals greater control over their own money. One of the standout features of MANTRA is its privacy. Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and ring signatures, it ensures that transactions remain untraceable and unlinkable. This makes MANTRA a go-to choice for those who prioritize privacy in their financial dealings. The currency‚Äôs governance model is another key aspect. MANTRA is governed by the consensus of its community members who hold MANTRA tokens, ensuring that no single entity has control over its operations. This decentralized approach makes it a truly community-driven currency. Additionally, MANTRA is designed to be both fast and scalable. By utilizing a proof-of-stake model, it allows for quick transaction confirmations while minimizing energy consumption, unlike traditional proof-of-work systems. Now, $OM, the native token of the MANTRA ecosystem, is listed on Bitget Exchange, offering users even more opportunities to trade and engage with the growing MANTRA ecosystem. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mantra"

But don‚Äôt overdo it‚Äî5 to 10 solid picks are better than spreading too thin. üî∏ Timing matters: While earlier in the year might have been better, now is still a reasonable time. Always keep some cash on hand to average down if the market dips. üî∏ Look beyond hype: Focus on altcoins with real-world utility or emerging potential. Exchange tokens and coins that haven‚Äôt peaked yet could offer great opportunities. üî∏ New vs. old projects: Top 100 coins that are newer and haven‚Äôt been through previous bull runs may outperform older projects. üî∏ Have a strategy: Avoid FOMO.

XION is here to change that by offering a much simpler blockchain experience. What is XION? XION is a Layer 1 blockchain designed with user experience in mind. Instead of traditional wallets, it uses a ""meta-account"" that removes the hassle of managing private keys and paying gas fees. You can even pay fees in USDC, making things more predictable. Fee Abstraction Made Easy One of the biggest headaches in Web3 is dealing with fluctuating gas fees. XION solves this by allowing users to pay fees in USDC, making it way easier to manage transactions without worrying about price changes in crypto. Meta-Account: No More Wallets The ""meta-account"" model eliminates the need for traditional wallets. It allows for centralized management with security features like multi-factor authentication, making it easier for non-crypto users to get started. Better Cross-Chain Interoperability Interoperability between blockchains is a huge issue. XION simplifies this by letting users interact with multiple blockchains via a single account. No more juggling multiple wallets. Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche work on blockchain communication, but XION goes a step further. While Polkadot and Cosmos allow blockchains to communicate, users still need to manage multiple wallets and complicated processes. XION makes it seamless, allowing multiple chains to work together without the user even noticing. Conclusion XION aims to make blockchain easier for everyone by eliminating common Web3 barriers like wallets, gas fees, and interoperability. While it‚Äôs still early, XION could help bring blockchain to the masses. Their token is listed on Bitget Pre-market and their TGE is coming soon. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xion/"

Holding on has definitely paid off! Instead of letting your SOL sit idle, why not put it to work? Staking is an excellent way to do this. You have options like BGSOL, which lets you stake your SOL while maintaining liquidity for trading or further investments. Let's discuss how to maximize your returns while ensuring security. The Solana blockchain offers various staking options with competitive yields. BGSOL, for instance, provides an attractive APR, allowing you to stake without tying up your funds, thus offering both flexibility and growth potential. Moreover, Marinade Finance provides an APY over 11% through native staking, self-custody, and automatic delegation to top validators, ensuring both high returns and safety. They have an impressive track record with 8M $SOL TVL, making them a strong contender. You might also look into BNSOL by Binance, which offers liquid staking supported by a major exchange, adding an extra layer of security if you're already familiar with their services. If maximizing APY is your goal, these platforms are your playground. Keep in mind, though, that higher APRs can carry higher risks, so it's crucial to balance potential returns with security. Social media buzz suggests Marinade Finance is on an upward trend due to its performance and reliability, making it a good option for diversifying your staking approach. Staking isn't just about stashing your assets away; it's about growing them as you anticipate the next big Solana move. Whether you choose BGSOL, Marinade Finance, or explore other staking options on the Solana network, you're well-positioned to leverage Solana's market surge without the hassle of constant trading.

"As a third-party project that‚Äôs looking to launch on the Kendu Chads Marketplace when it goes live, I wanted to give my perspective",https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1h05c1b/as_a_thirdparty_project_thats_looking_to_launch/,,4,0.75,20,lemond4455,1732601942.0,"Core, JUST","First, a very quick background. I was initially drawn to Kendu just a couple of months after its inception because I noticed that unlike many memecoins, it was attempting to build out out an actual ecosystem (with the Chads Marketplace being the centrepiece of this), but also because it seemed pretty decentralised in that it emphasises community putting effort in instead of just someone at the top calling the shots. On the point about the ecosystem, I‚Äôve [previously gone into how I‚Äôll be putting my skills as an outside dev to build some third-party, open source tooling for the Marketplace when it launches](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1fyeurm/looking_forward_to_building_open_source_tools_for/) but also [some other ways I could see more utility coming to the project](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1fz23bh/bringing_utility_by_getting_kendu_listed_on_more/). On top of this sort of stuff, I also announced months ago that my own fairly small project, Ingex, [would look to launch a small collection on the Chads Marketplace when the latter goes live](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/1fzznt3/ingex_revenuebearing_tokens_explained_and_our/). Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm just going to try and be as straight forward about this as possible. I think there‚Äôs been a few missteps within Kendu in recent days (and I think the dev himself has posted that he could have gone about some things in a better way). I even got to the point where I started to look at whether I should reassess some of my plans for the ecosystem. In the end, I realised two things though: going back to earlier, Kendu is *not* just one person or even a small team, it‚Äôs decentralised community of thousands of people, many of which post about it day in and day out, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like the core of this community is going anywhere. The second thing is that the main fundamentals, like launching the Chads Marketplace still seem to be on track as far as I can tell, and there hasn‚Äôt been any scaling back on the ambitions that were laid out by the team. So with those two things, and as long as nothing major changes in this respect, I will be continuing with the plans I set out months ago in terms of launching on the Chads Marketplace and even putting my skills to use by building out some open source tooling for the ecosystem. Like I said, I think the fundamentals are still there and I‚Äôm not too concerned about the short term price either because I‚Äôve seen other projects trend downwards for long periods only to suddenly shoot up based on longer term prospects. **On this note, please consider also [supporting our project directly](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex/overview) as we've been working hard on this stuff with months now, have been consistent in meeting our milestones, and have seen the value of our token triple in recent weeks (check sale history) before we've even made our main set of annoucements.** Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu"

You've likely heard the term DePIN circulating in the tech world, but what does it really mean? Let's break it down! What is DePIN? DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network. At its core, DePIN uses blockchain technology to manage and operate physical infrastructure‚Äîsuch as data storage, computing power, and telecommunications‚Äîdecentralized. This approach shifts control from large corporations to a network of independent participants, promoting resilience, security, and user empowerment. Key Components of DePIN: üîπ Decentralization: DePIN distributes infrastructure management across a blockchain network, removing the reliance on a single central authority. This eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risk of outages or cyberattacks. üîπ Tokenized Incentives: Participants earn tokens by contributing resources like computing power, storage, or bandwidth. This incentivizes a self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem. üîπPhysical Infrastructure Integration: DePIN bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds by incorporating real-world assets, from decentralized data centers to community-powered telecom networks. üîπ Points of Presence (PoPs): Distributed infrastructure points (PoPs) form the backbone of DePIN networks. At Serenity, we‚Äôre building a robust global network of PoPs to challenge the centralized dominance of tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our PoPs ensure resilience, speed, and true decentralization. Why DePIN is the Future: DePIN represents a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is managed. By decentralizing control, it democratizes access, enhances security, and fosters innovation. Industries like data storage, energy, telecommunications, and computing are already being transformed by DePIN models. Serenity's Role in DePIN: At Serenity, we're leading the way with our decentralized storage solutions: \- sBox: Secure, decentralized storage with biometric access and inheritance planning features powered by the SERSH token. \- Infrastructure Expansion: Our growing network of PoPs offers a powerful alternative to Big Tech's centralized dominance. \- Community Empowerment: With Serenity‚Äôs DePIN approach, Users! Not corporations! Control their data. Discover how Serenity‚Äôs DePIN solutions can empower you!

The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar. **Facts** * We are the cusp of having 15K holders * Kendu is almost 10 months old * We rank top 10% in subreddit size * We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed * Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE) * Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase) * We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more. * We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine * Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu * We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started * We have the best organic community in the space, bar none Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive. We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun. There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends. ""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have: \- Inspired people hustling daily \- 6+ months old \- Survived multiple large drops \- Holder Count growing every month \- $20 Billion+ Target \- Great Distribution + Diamondhands"" Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well. Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.
