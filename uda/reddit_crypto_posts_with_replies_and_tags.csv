I‚Äôm afraid of Defi. Should I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1h5xtt4/im_afraid_of_defi_should_i/,,8,0.83,50,Horror-Badger9314,1733259113.0,"USDC, TRON, Dai, Aave, Safe, JUST, FLEX, IQ, Ark, Usual, Wen, Mode, Ren, ARC, MAD, Kin, Tectonic, Troll, MON, UNI",I want to add around 20k usd and chase for around 15% APY in stable. At AAVE this is not that hard but even there I‚Äôm a little afraid. Am I just old? How risky is that?,"It is risky, all smart contracts are risky. But there are people in Aave with millions of dollars and they've had millions of dollars worth of audits on their smart contracts.  Also, the APY is variable because a bunch of old people in governments don't set the interest rates. Before you use a protocol, always read the docs, even if you don't understand all of it, you will at least understand some of it and it's important to understand how they work because a lot of people put money into Aave when the interest rates are high without knowing how the rates work and then month later think Aave is scamming them because the rates went down  More than likely you're looking around a 4-6% on average APY on most stables. Some days it will be 30%, some days it will be 1%. In the last bull market rates on Aave for USDC reached over 90% at one point, but averaged out it was 4% || more risky than buying tbills or putting into something like a wealthfront  but outside of the smart contracts getting hacked, as long as the servers / nodes running the chain are still up, it's as safe as you can get in defi. every loan is overcollateralized (meaning the borrowers get liquidated if they can't repay the loan, and you are made whole)  they have 33 billion in liquidity, by far the largest lending protocol || The APY is flexible. Don't expect it to remain this high in a general crypto bear market.  Do you have crypto experience & are managing your funds with a hardware wallet? If yes then go for it.  AAVE is open source code & only offers over-collaterized loans for the assets that others supply. You aren't locked into any terms or such. || It‚Äôs not particularly risky to use AAVE; however, those rates are variable and likely to fall back to around 5-8% soon. Most stablecoin rates in defi coalesce around that area these days, which is where the Dai Savings Rate currently sits. Honestly, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not worth it. You‚Äôll get a better APY on average from a broad-based index ETF. Stablecoin yields are really better for people who, for whatever reason, can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to go off chain. || Would love to see what people have to say about this as well || If you have absolutely no idea what you are doing then it is super risky. || Don‚Äôt trust aave, its not like a bank. Coins can be hacked etc || DeFi is generally not risky when you choose the right project... My opinion is that you can have decentralized nodes and get passive income + with a good token and growth potential you take into consideration. I think it's about 25% on Rivalz Network and it's the first Intel Layer AI project, that came to mind, but there are a lot of good options. In addition, following the AI ‚Äã‚Äãnarrative, a lot of money will come there in the next 3 years, all the researches say so. || Personally, I like to yield farm stablecoin LPs on Quickswap (r/quickswap). It‚Äôll payout in $quick, but you can swap back into more stables after claiming.   Most rates are 15%+ currently, and even during the bear market they were 8-10% || Be afraid? No! Be cautious? Yes! Defi is great but do your research, don't just dive right in without educating yourself || Afraid is a strong word, but you need to understand that there are no free lunches  The first thing you need to ask yourself is ‚Äúwhere the yield is coming from?‚Äù. The second question is ‚Äúwhat would potentially prevent me from taking my funds out and walk away‚Äù  Until you have good understanding of both answers,  you probably shouldn‚Äôt play (unless you enjoy being the exit liquidity) || In reality, you're gonna net around 9%. Still great tho, definitely better than a savings account || Chasing high interest rates on stablecoins in DeFi sounds great! hmmm hunmmmmmm sounds familiar can‚Äôt put my finger on it‚Ä¶.. might have rhymed with Tuna || You probably won't average out to 15% on Aave.  It's usually like 4 to 7 and maybe once a week or so it'll be like 20%+ for a few hours. || scared money don't make money || Do not do it you have too many risks such as smart contract,phishing,crypto drainer honestly its not worth it. Protect your money and manage your risk || Start small and build up your confidence || USDE stablecoin pays APY of 29% on Bitget || Very. Not much is stopping these lenders from sunsetting, so  you want to spread that risk across platforms, chains and coins to start; ignoring institutional claims that something is 'safe.' || just dive in dude, nothing to be afraid of. Live and learn, it's the way. DeFi is financial freedom.   Lots of opportunities out there || Be careful, that‚Äôs risky || Yes im very experienced using ledger and everything else || Yeah I think about this too. Maybe a SP500 ETF would be better || I mean, 5-8% average with 15-20% peaks doesn't sound too bad. I diversify and have the ETFs like you said and also a % of my portfolio in Aave. || S&P historically is 6%. || Aave is smart contracts, not a banking platform || We're talking about defi protocols. I collect my own data. It's 9% for USDC || I think I‚Äôd still hedge my risk and put my eggs across various baskets || ok. || yea. ive been doing this for years. sometimes i'll use earnings from winners to boost holdings of the losers. its a 10 hour a week time commitment but its been paying the bills. || Yeah, I'm only commenting on the sunsetting part. || I'm saying Aave can't sunset anything. Even if users lending to the protocol left, if that's what you meant by lenders, the rates would only increase - but they always get arbitraged so it wouldn't last too long like usual. || That‚Äôs nice. Do you feel like this bull run is almost over? Or are you hyperfocused on stablecoin APY farming? || [removed] || ok || Yeah I agree with you, I‚Äôm I‚Äôd say a young old at 32, and this guys sounding like my dad when I‚Äôm talking to him about crypto‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs skepticism always comes back to, ‚Äúwell someone has to be making money or have the ability to control it‚Äù‚Ä¶ ummm can we not grasp the name of the concept even?? DECENTRALIZED Finance.. I‚Äôm not trying to give the impressing that smart contracts and various liquidity protocols are the safest thing, but I do think that a ton of ppl still are in the head space that this is the same thing as a Bank, where there is always a person or small group with 100% control to do whatever. While in a way kinda sorta , but also not really since no one really owns it. At least I hope I‚Äôm thinking about it correctly‚Ä¶ || ok. im not going to argue with your ignorance. || No and no.

We cannot know if these manipulations are carried out by the platform or agents hired by itself to generate income for itself. Audits might help but in an unregulated industry we will not know if a platform is playing nice as its not always profitable to do so. || I'm not arguing. Aave is controlled by governance. Updates can't be made to the protocol without voting on it and the process requires a lot of steps actually, not just sending calldata and voting. I wasn't sure if you meant Aave itself or the users of Aave sunsetting || >Never forget SBF. It will happen again.  What does that have to do with stablecoin apy farming? || users dont sunset. platforms do. not all users on a lending platform are borrowing. || you forgot. || That's what I thought you were saying and no Aave can't shut down the protocol. Only governance can, this was updated a while ago. But really only deactivating/pausing pools. Which is a good thing for security purposes. || Nah I think you forgot, FTX collapse had nothing to do with lending stablecoins || they can stop paying the hosting bill for their web interfaces. that would lock out a majority of users. || ok. || Are you meming me?"
How OriginTrail TRAC Uses AI to Build a Better World ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1h63xe8/how_origintrail_trac_uses_ai_to_build_a_better/,,9,0.85,10,snakeo087,1733274950.0,"TRON, Stellar, Core, Mina, Safe, Amp, OriginTrail, JUST, FLEX, IQ, Dent, Ark, WHY, Stella, Mode, Ren, RAMP, Kin, MON, UNI","Hey Redditors, I wanted to start a discussion about how **OriginTrail (TRAC)**, a project many might associate with supply chains, is leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to make a tangible impact on our world. # What is OriginTrail? At its core, OriginTrail is a **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** that organizes and connects data from diverse ecosystems. It‚Äôs like a global brain for trusted data, allowing different sectors like supply chain, healthcare, and Web3 to interoperate seamlessly. # The AI Angle OriginTrail integrates **AI technologies** to extract meaningful insights from massive datasets while ensuring that these insights are **trustworthy and tamper-proof**. For example: 1. **Supply Chain Optimization**: AI models running on the DKG can predict disruptions and improve efficiency in logistics. 2. **Sustainability Monitoring**: AI-driven data analysis helps businesses meet compliance standards like carbon tracking, enabling real environmental impact. 3. **Healthcare Solutions**: In pharmaceuticals, OriginTrail ensures the authenticity of medicines while AI helps analyze and predict trends in data. # Why It Matters AI's potential is often limited by the **quality and trustworthiness of the data** it uses. OriginTrail‚Äôs DKG bridges this gap by ensuring data integrity and interoperability, making AI applications more reliable and impactful. # Let‚Äôs Discuss * **Have you come across other blockchain projects integrating AI like this?** * **What‚Äôs your take on the role of trusted data in maximizing AI‚Äôs potential?** * **Where else could OriginTrail's AI capabilities be applied?** Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!","Origintrail could be used in digital identity by verifying identities securely and even making online voting systems safer. || Agree! || Yea it really is a remarkable project in so many ways, the digital identity thing and voting is interesting, hadn't thought of that, but then again there are going to be so many applications the will come later on from the what they are building right now.. I mean you asked about other projects, I think we can agree this is pretty unique in the AI, RWA space || TRAC appears to be a breath of fresh air in the world of crypto.    A project with multiple real-world use cases that are actually implemented and generating real revenue through usage of the underlying token - and strongly plays toward compelling crypto themes like AI and DeSci.  A stellar team with impressive, experienced advisors involved (including Bob Metcalfe and Greg Kidd).  A fixed supply with a non-inflationary coin against ramping usage across diverse end markets and a number of leading corporations and governmental organizations on board.    How is the world missing the potential here?  Shocked that TRAC is somehow not even in the top 200 by market cap! || That's an awesome idea! elections are such a foundational part of democracy, so using OriginTrail to make them more honest and secure would be a game changer. Imagine having verified, tamper-proof records for votes, identities, and processes. It‚Äôd add transparency and cut down on the doubts people sometimes have about fairness. And it‚Äôs not just elections, it could make government data more trustworthy across the board. || Absolutely! The possibilities with TRAC are indeed limitless. The way it‚Äôs bridging gaps in data trust and interoperability is game changing. I couldn‚Äôt agree more! this unique approach has the potential to make OriginTrail a backbone for countless innovations across industries. || and if I'm not mistaken they already have working partnerships with the EU and US government, though a lot of that is supply chain stuff || yes, Origintrail has partnerships with the EU and involed with projects such as GS1 system a global standard that works with US gov. || and this I dont know if you've seen it:   [https://www.origintrail.io/blog/european-union-supports-sustainability-of-construction-industry-with-the-buildchain-project-bringing-trustworthy-knowledge-exchange-using-the-decentralized-knowledge-graph](https://www.origintrail.io/blog/european-union-supports-sustainability-of-construction-industry-with-the-buildchain-project-bringing-trustworthy-knowledge-exchange-using-the-decentralized-knowledge-graph) || Sorry i'm kind of hijacking the AI thread and talking about the supply chain aspect, but what blows me away is that they keep doing what they're doing, building the tech, making more partnerships etc and its all kind of under the radar. Take SCAN for example..   "" BSI and SCAN are utilizing the OriginTrail protocol to ensure the integrity of security audits for some of the largest US importers.  The Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN) is an association of importers, such as Costco, Walmart, Target, The Home Depot and others, formed to eliminate foreign factory audit fatigue associated with Supply Chain Security importing criteria within the US Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program (CTPAT). SCAN importing members have a combined annual sales of USD 1.36 trillion, sourcing from factories around the world.  Today, SCAN has more than 22,000 factories in its database, with several hundred new audits conducted monthly. All audits are secured with the OriginTrail Decentralized Network and comply with SCAN‚Äôs rigorous data privacy requirements. With flexible data permissions, the solution enables SCAN to share data with government agencies such as CTPAT.

The 2-4x I hope is left in those coins I wouldn‚Äôt say is worth jumping in at these prices. || I did say I don't think a 39X will repeat but a $4-$6 ADA is a conservative target and $8-$10 wouldn't surprise me this cycle. I consider it a great risk adjusted return because even if the cycle ends early or you want to hold 10-20 years, ADA has stayed in the top 10 since it was just a white paper back in 2017. We don't know the OP's risk tolerance. I stand behind my answer, it's still very early in the cardano ecosystem and I think it will become one of the fastest growing chains as we're still early in this alt season. It's not all shit cans and meme's in there, there are some quality projects also."

All purchases were made on Monday, Dec. 2, when the market was peaking. Not new to crypto, but I wanted to take $5k, build something diverse, and see what it grows into. Should be a roller coaster of an exercise, but I‚Äôll be holding long term. Give me your honest and brutal opinions or any suggestions about reallocating. I‚Äôm considering swapping my LTC for some lower market-cap coins. Thoughts? Here‚Äôs my current portfolio: Cardano (ADA): $532.96 (Down $37.86, -6.64%) Litecoin (LTC): $490.02 (Up $4.59, 0.95%) Chainlink (LINK): $482.41 (Down $3.18, -0.66%) Algorand (ALGO): $480.40 (Down $5.91, -1.22%) Amp (AMP): $479.72 (Up $92.29, 23.79%) Polkadot (DOT): $471.10 (Down $14.85, -3.06%) Hedera (HBAR): $427.57 (Down $58.45, -12.04%) XRP: $301.11 (Down $21.82, -6.76%) Hege (HEGE): $803.14 (Down $59.66, -6.91%)","I like it good for you. Personal I favour Cardano and Defi. But I like Amp and can see the potential there. I wouldn‚Äôt have gone all in, instead DCA into these projects buying the dip as it comes. All in all hodl for long term. || avaxxx || Man that‚Äôs a lot of fees.  I joined Coinbase one for 30$ a month and you pay zero fees then you can cancel  after month or two. || Make sure you take profits of you're up, your portfolio will und up worth $500 or less if you hold into the bear market. || Swap litecoin for kaspa || Damn.

Smart investors are thinking about selling and profit taking at the moment. || That‚Äôs a lot of shit coins || Comon u gotta add ICP  When you buy ICP you get the BEST TECH and community. With other coins ur just in a community with delusional people. || get rid of ltc || Eh. Long term is a bit funny.   Alt Season will continue for the next 3-4 months, you have a reasonable spread. You can make some gains on likely all of them in that time. Then I would imagine a lot of people will be pulling out for btc. || Literally just buy the top 5 meme coins on sol and you'll outperform whatever this boomer portfolio is || Not if they're smart enough to see where we're at in the four year cycle || Name checks out || lol ok boomer || Pause. I hope you know it would be extremely stupid to actually believe in a 4 year cycle, and invest accordingly to that. || Lol.  So you support these centralized projects controlled by greedy fucks like ripple labs? Or are you just trying to make a quick buck and don‚Äôt care what coin you choose to accomplish that?"

All you're doing is asking for scammers to contact you with ""great investment opportunities that only cost a few thousand dollars"" lol  Be extremely cautious and extremely careful entering this space and understand that anyone DM'ing, texting, emailing or calling you about crypto is 100% a scammer.    I love crypto been in it for years but its a cesspool for scammers and hackers.    Learn everything you can about Bitcoin and then learn about smart chains such as Ethereum and Solana.  Open an exchange account with a legitimate platform ONLY.  Coinbase, Binance, Kraken.  Do not open an account with some no named new crypto platform thats promising ""great returns"" those all are scams.    Start slow, be humble and understand that you're probably going to lose money before you make any. || Invest in utility || Have a look at $SSSSS SnakeWifHat has a lot of potential and worth chucking a bit into it.

Cosmos or Polkadot?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1h657n3/cosmos_or_polkadot/,,3,1.0,7,myredditburner111,1733278695.0,"Bitcoin, Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, JUST, Ark, Velo, Mode, Ren, ARC, Botto, Kin, MON","Thinking about buying either DOT or ATOM as the are both good prices right now for entries and they have good developer data, good drawdown rates. From there ATH they are both about like a 10x from where they are right now and I just feel like they are sold alts. ATOM has a lower market cap than DOT but not sure how much that plays into everything. Please let me know what you guys think. Gonna load up on one or maybe both!","Wake the fuck up, Samurai. We have a city to Polkadot.  We‚Äôre early, get in. || For the record, I own both, but I own a lot more ATOM. I like ATOM more, unsurprisingly. It's built on cypherpunk ideals, has a ton of development, is cheap, fast, and secure. Some marks against it are the high staking reward. If you don't have a lot and don't have it staked, you're getting diluted. You can also launch a token on the network that's totally disconnected from ATOM. So, theoretically, you could have an alt on Cosmos that soars, but it does absolutely nothing for the ATOM price.  DOT was purchased at what I perceived to be the bottom of the market just as a hedge. I can't tell you really anything about it. I just wanted a bag in case it did some Solana-like move.  I have some Bitcoin that I'd love to swap for some alts, but I can't stomach the $20 network fee to move it to another one of my own damn wallets. And that's just the test transaction -- you got the big one after that. Not an issue with ATOM. But, also, cypherpunk ideals. It's important to me to support the privacy, autonomy, and free speech when I can. || Dot is a dead chain. Only reason it‚Äôs pumping is dumb money right now(retail buying the same dinosaur coins from last cycle). Cosmos has a huge ecosystem and more potential. Listen dude. Don‚Äôt stress it too much. Both are gonna pump. It‚Äôs an easy mode market right now. Flip a coin and buy wtv,doesn‚Äôt really matter.

On top of that the actual tokenomics of the DOT token are just ok.  Cosmos has so much going on, it really is a big eco system which keeps growing.. I did much better with Cosmos and some of the projects using it then I did on DOT.  Unless there are some new improvements coming down the pipe, I like Cosmos over Dot. || I am still 50% down on both üò≠ so yes great entry right now. || Yes people aren‚Äôt doing their research"
