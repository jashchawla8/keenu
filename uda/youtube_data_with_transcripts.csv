subscribe button check the description for links you can use to connect with me in the bit squad all right guys no more waiting here we go on the adventure to discover the secrecy of cryptocharts so hop on the bus as you guys may know if you follow this series reading charts is a basic technique of technical analysis in which traders will rely on historic statistics and metrics to analyze market movements looking at all these confusing lines and shapes seems daunting at first but don't worry it's not that difficult to digest if you know where to start and i'm here to show you every tip that works cryptocharts can be displayed with various time frames depending on your intention you can choose to sort out a graph for 15 minutes one hour 24 hours the whole week or all the existence of a project it also reflects your trading style day traders often concentrate on short periods so they can extract the best shots within the same day swing traders may want to look at a longer duration for example a couple of days or a week to detect price moves while long-term investors may look at periods of months or years there are different ways to visualize cryptocharts so you should get familiar with that price can be displayed in a simple line which merely describes price changes during the selected time line charts are divided into two types logarithmic scale and linear or aka a rhythmic scale the linear scale represents price changes in absolute values while the log scale draws the reversal in percentages sometimes these two lines look a lot alike the only difference is the vertical scale price in linear charts is chopped off equally while in log charts the price scale is divided by percentage changes you should be able to tell which one you're looking at log charts often set the default view as it better reflects the trend and amplitude of the total price you can also look at below these charts for the volume indicator which presents how much crypto has been traded in that period combined with a price chart volume indicators can help build the most vivid picture over the market if you notice both the price and the volume are increasing it may simply imply people are rushing to buy and the rally is possibly continuing on the other hand if the price goes up but cannot accelerate the purchasing power means traders are still skeptical of a bubble another chart that you might have heard quite often is candlestick pattern sound familiar we've already talked about it at least a dozen times in these previous videos now let's do a recap in case you weren't paying attention candlestick charts provide much more informative data not only price moves and volumes but also include the opening and closing price the highest and lowest level in one session it's so popular to see candlestick dashboards with subsequent columns full in green and red that may remind you green illustrates an uptrend while red is for a downtrend there are different types of candlesticks but in this video i'm going to re-emphasize the most common patterns you will see while trading the bull market has two typical candlesticks which are the hammer and the reverse hammer they are specified by green color whereas in the hammer the thick column lines on the top the tail below resembling an uptrend following after a downtrend the reverse hammer has the thick column hung at the bottom indicating a more stable uptrend throughout the session conversely there are hanging mans and shooting star candlestick patterns which symbol the bearish market the hanging man with the red thick column on the top of the line giving a signal about a recession after a bull while the shooting star has the red at the bottom warning about a mainstream downtrend movement you can look at a market depth chart to get a picture of the supply and demand of the current market in this chart the green area indicates the number of coins and buy orders at that moment while the red area shows the sell amount at that current price the connecting point between the two sides is the current market price you can move your mouse anywhere to take a closer look at the specified price and sold or bought amount you cannot merely view the line chart or candlestick chart in a single day so i'm going to present you some extra techniques and indicators to help you capture the trend over a set period two basic indicators you might hear often are support and resistance the support line is used to point out the bottom of a downtrend in which the plunge is expected to bounce back and push the price back up on the other hand the resistance line refers to a level on the top where an uptrend may defer technically the support line indicates the lowest price so traders can buy the dip and resistance is the highest price in a bull market for doing that after that an inverted trend will take place making the market balanced again next we will have moving averages while the simple moving averages are pretty appropriate for showing the trending lines by connecting different averages in market price i'll give you an advanced variant of that which is called moving averages convergence divergence the macd main line is generated from the subtraction of two of the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages or emas plus there is a signal line from a 9 day ema each macd creates a historiogram based on the difference between the two emas i have to admit it sounds quite complex but hang on you just need to understand that a positive macd line above the zero lines refers to an uptrend otherwise it's in a downside and when the macd line is above the signal line it often indicates the entry point the opposite situation might suggest the time to exit guys are you still with me where did everybody go the lecture is not over yet oh you're still here thank you you've already completed about 99 of this journey don't give up as you have with all the other objectives you've ever set for yourself just finish the last 10 this next indicator also uses the simple moving average and it's called bollinger bands just as the name suggests the bollinger bands add an upper and lower band factoring by the standard deviations around the moving average the moving average line moves closer to the upper band it typifies an overbought market state the other situation indicates an oversold state the wider the bands the more volatile the coins and the wider their of swing now for the last indicator i want to mention the relative strength index or rsi this specifies market momentum via overbought and oversold states which are illustrated by two lines across the chart usually assigned from default values 70 percent were overbought and 30 oversold in theory when rsi line crosses the upper or lower line it blows a whistle does the market buying or selling orders are too much then the trend is probably going to rebound and push the price back to the balance level hence when you see the market is in an overbought state the rsi goes below 70. it is the signal to sell on the opposite when the market is oversold the rsi exceeds 30 it's time to buy as i promised i've made this video truly informative don't grumble or resent me as i know this was a lot of information take your time and digest all the tips you'll be amazed at just how helpful they are when you truly begin to make the best out of these charts but now it's your turn which indicators do you find most efficient for analyzing crypto prices what other types of charts do you find useful when trading let

Introduction","hey guys and welcome to another episode right now we're seeing one of the biggest crypto bull runs as Bitcoin has exceeded its alltime high just a month before the crypto having this means we might see some projects increase in value by 10 100 or even 1,000 times in the upcoming months however investing in crypto isn't always easy some projects end up worth nothing causing investors to lose all their money just like any other Market the crypto Market has both opportunities and risks so making a profit depends on finding the right coins to invest in so in this video we're going to give you a brief explanation of the crypto Market Basics and what you need to think about when you're looking to trade and invest in coins we'll give you a step-by-step guide on how to trade crypto coins and the platforms you can use plus a few tips that can boost your returns finally we'll provide a rules-based trading setup to help you find the best positions to enter the market based onch technical situations so guys if that's something you're interested in hit the like button to show your support and subscribe to our Channel if you're new since we share Advanced trading knowledge see you after the intro and [Music] disclaimer as I mentioned earlier Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time high just just a month before the Bitcoin having but what exactly is Bitcoin having and why is it important every 4 years the block reward for Bitcoin miners is haved in an event called Bitcoin having this will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins are issued but will it impact the price of Bitcoin and cause it to rise let's answer this question by examining the Bitcoin price during the previous 12 July 2016 and may 2020 if we look at the short-term price chart immediately after the 2 to 3 weeks following the Bitcoin having events we can see that not much usually happens typically it only brings volatility but what about a longer term period like 3 to 6 months after the having event in the 2012 having we experienced a major rally and by April the Bitcoin price had significantly increased up to 10 times within 6 months in the 2016 having a very similar pattern emerged the price began a one-year-long major bull market driving the Bitcoin price from $600 to $118,000 then in 2020 we saw a six-month ranging market for Bitcoin before it started to take off so what can we conclude from all this data overall we can conclude that the market Direction tends to be bullish and eventually the cycle does take off however the exact timing of when the rout R can begin is very hard to predict we may still witness a sideways Market even a couple of months after the having event when bitcoin's price Rises it can create a positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency Market leading to increased investor confidence and investment flows into other cryptocurrencies as well this can result in a general uptrend across many cryptocurrencies however it doesn't necessarily guarantee that all other coins will rise simultaneously despite this fact investors often prefer to invest in smaller cap coins instead of Bitcoin for several reasons these smaller cap coins have the potential for significant price appreciation over a short period which can lead to substantial returns for investors this potential for large gains attracts investors seeking high- risk High reward opportunities but what does smaller cap coin mean this term refers to cryptocurrency coins that have relatively smaller market capitalization compared to the top coins crypto market cap refers to the market capitalization which is the total value of a certain cryptocurrency in circulation it's calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin for example the market cap for Bitcoin was $357 billion as of September 22nd 2022 this means that if you multiplied all the Bitcoins in circulation by the current price of Bitcoin you would get a total market value of $357 billion now when discussing smaller cap coins two terms come to mind altcoins and meme coins altcoin is a general term used to describe any cryptocurrency that serves as an alternative to bitcoin these coins cover a wide range of projects and can vary greatly in terms of their technology uses and Market values altcoins include cryptocurrencies like ethereum Ripple Litecoin and others they often aim to tackle specific limitations of Bitcoin such as scalability privacy or functionality and may offer unique features or applications meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency that is primarily influenced by internet memes social media trends and Community involvement rather than fundamental technological or financial principles meme coins often have a light-hearted or satirical nature and may be created as a joke or parody of traditional cryptocurrencies the value and popularity of meme coins are usually driven by viral internet friends social media influencers and online communities rather than underlying technology or utility examples of meme coins include Dogecoin Sheba enu Pepe and other cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or cultural references in summary while altcoins cover a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies with diverse features and purposes mem coins specifically refer to cryptocurrencies characterized by their Reliance on memes internet culture and and community-driven narratives trading meme coins carries an exceptionally high level of risk they tend to either Skyrocket by thousands of times or plummet to zero with very little middle ground smaller market cap cryptocurrencies inherently come with high risk but also offer the potential for higher rewards conversely large cap cryptos are lower risk but may not yield as significant returns midcaps fall somewhere in between it's important to note that mem coins typically fall at the extreme end of the small market caps Spectrum their micromarket caps pose an extremely high risk but also offer potentially High rewards it's prudent to maintain a balanced crypto portfolio comprising large caps midcaps and small caps if you examine the chart of nearly every meme coin you'll notice a similar pattern it usually begins with a big jump in value because people are speculating followed by a crash a few recovery waves and then a period of range this pattern often occurs because many Bots invest in meme coins they find on decentralized Exchange aggregators like Dex tools hoping for quick gains which rarely materialize once meme coins Flatline there are two possibilities either they Fade Into Obscurity or experience a recovery however it usually takes a significant Catalyst to awaken a meme coin from its Slumber unfortunately for most meme coins this Catalyst never materializes in theory it's impossible to predict if and when this revival Catalyst will occur how however in practice there are several factors to consider that could increase the likelihood of such an event which we will cover in the next videos now we come to the question of how to buy and sell crypto coins many platforms enable you to do so but the crucial Point here is that before you begin trading on any platform you must have a well-defined crypto trading and risk management strategy one of the platforms for trading and investing in cryptocurrencies is bybit bybit is among the highest rated cryptocurrency exchanges globally and according to coin gecko it ranks as the second largest cryptocurrency exchange after binance if you don't have a buybit account yet you can sign up using the link provided in the description once you've created your account navigate to the market overview on the homepage here you can access the list of cryptocurrencies available on buybit along with a wealth of useful information here you can also select any category to view related cryptocurrencies clicking on the details will open a page you can find information related to that coin such as market cap trading volume and a brief explanation of the coin itself if you click on trade a page opens that allows you to access the price chart and trading tools to analyze the current technical situation of the market you can also Place buy and sell orders directly from this page and search for any crypto currency you want from the top left corner now we've reached the part of technical analysis and in the trading setup to enter the market it's important to note that technical analysis remains relevant across different platforms so if you have a trading strategy that works well for you in Forex the same strategy will likely work in the crypto Market as well however we recommend a trading strategy that relies on Market Direction higher timef frame key levels and optimal retracement levels to enter the crypto Market in this part of the video we'll present a step-by-step guide to a trading strategy that integrates all of these Concepts but before we continue if you've enjoyed this video so far make sure to hit the like button to show your support and comment below to tell us what topics you want us to cover next the first step of this trading plan is to identify Market Direction you can use any time frame to start with depending on whether you're seeking a short-term or long-term trade however we recommend using higher time frames such as 4 hours and 1 hour to determine the current market Direction since lower time frames can contain a lot of noise it could be frustrating to identify the market sentiment as we start our analysis on the 1hour chart our first step is to draw the market structure schematic to understand the market Direction and structure this schematic is outlined from the lowest point to the highest points of visible swings for example here this could show the swings of Market structure for this chart Additionally you can draw some internal structures onto the chart as well however the main goal of drawing a schematic is to see the recent movements of bulls and bears in the line chart to get a clearer idea of who is in control so try to make it as simple as possible in a bullish Market we simply want the price to respect the demand areas and continue making higher highs and higher lows if the price breaks and closes below a demand area it shows that the buyers are losing control if it continues to make one two and three moves to the downside then we will potentially witness a new bearish trend on the other hand if it breaks the high to the upside it indicates that the buyers are still in control and we can look for long opportunities the same concept is applied to the bearish scenario now after identifying the direction we would zoom out to higher time frames to find higher time frame key levels the main reason for identifying higher time frame key levels is to see how much space we have before reaching the next important level in front of the price and to determine where to set our long-term targets for this top- down analysis we use three time frames weekly daily and 4H hour when identifying key levels we mainly focus on some of the most important criteria first more touches are better more touches indicate that more people are paying attention to that area and when the price reaches that level they are more likely to react second long Wicks indicate that the price has been immediately rejected increasing the like Ood of rejection again third a drastic move away with imbalance suggests that many participants and a significant amount of money have taken action in that area now after identifying higher time frame key levels it's time to search for a trading setup and execute the trade as mentioned earlier you can use any trading setup that works for you however it's crucial to conduct your own back testing before placing any trades with real money back testing helps you build the necessary confidence and assess the performance of your trading setup unfortunately back testing can be timec consuming that's why we use trade regge to save time and keep track of all our back testing once you have completed the back testing Trader Edge will provide a detailed Matrix with Vital Information including win rate maximum draw down profit gains and more if you'd like to try a 7-Day free trial check the link in the description now the trading setup we recommend for entering the position is is based on simple retracement and Fibonacci levels essentially when trading crypto coins you want to buy low and sell high once we've identified the latest impulsive movement aligned with the direction we will apply the Fibonacci retracement tool from the start of the move to the end anywhere between the 61.8% and 78.6% levels is an excellent area to place a long position in the bullish scenario the same principle applies to the bearish scenario our stop loss Will will be placed below the swing low to protect our position and we can Target the first level in front of the price now let's apply all of the concept step by step on the chart here on the sa 1hour time frame we can see that the market has recently shifted to a bullish Market by breaking above these Supply zones this is our latest Market schematic and it's clearly making higher highs and higher lows now let's zoom out to the higher time frame to see the bigger picture here on the daily time frame we can identify two key levels near the current price so we draw them in now let's zoom into the 4 hours in the 4 hours first we adjust the daily levels based on the 4our candles and then draw 4our levels if visible we can see that this level has acted as both support and resistance multiple times so we draw it in the 4-Hour price action shows that the price has recently rejected the daily level and we still have room before reaching the next key level so let's return to the 1hour chart and execute the trade on the 1our chart we can see that our latest impulsive move started somewhere around here and extended all the way up to here we will apply the Fibonacci retracement tool and mark the area between the 61.8% and 78.6% levels this is our optimal demand zone for trade you can either set a buy position in the middle of this range put your stop below the swing low and Target the next level in front of the price price alternatively you can wait for a pullback and zoom into lower time frames to find more confirmation this confirmation could be a double bottom inside this range now this is a perfect example of a price action trading plan where we have combined the market Direction higher time frame key levels and retracement levels to enter the market the crypto Market has the potential to yield massive profits but it also carries significant risks that's why you need to have a solid risk management plan when placing trades so guys that's it for this video I hope this video provided value to you if it did please go ahead and smash the like

period of time meaning over the next 12 to 14 months not tomorrow not next week not next month over the next year it may or may not happen nothing may happen everything may go to zero however if the altcoin season cycle that has been happening since around 2017 after the 2016 Bitcoin having event plays out as it has historically we could see some insane upward price action before crashing back down to where we have been over the past few years or even lower the most common question I receive is what cryptocurrencies to buy and as we've been discussing if we look at the price charts of 90% of all the cryptocurrencies in previous Cycles they all experience similar price action unless a project is a blatant scam experiences a rogue pool encounters a glitch hack or similar literally everything goes up around the same time and C cashes down at the same time so let's go over the cryptocurrencies I'm considering rolling the dys on willing and able to lose it all lose every scent of whatever I throw in trying to buy low now to hopefully potentially sell High later in this crazy crypto Casino hello I'm crypto Casey in this video we are going to explore the cryptocurrencies I'm thinking about gambling on this potentially last big crypto Bull Run let's hit it please be sure to check out our sponsors Ledger tangum and go baby trade as crypto investors we need to diversify

we've been getting a lot of great feedback over the past few months Join one of their free weekly webinars to learn more so scroll down and use links below to redeem any special offers they have for us all right before jumping in here are six things to keep in mind throughout this video one this is Absolut not Financial advice these are cryptocurrencies I'm watching as potential Casino picks that I am fully prepared to lose every single sent on two I am not affiliated with any of these projects the channel is not sponsored by any of these projects I have no contact with anybody that works with these projects I have no Insight or knowledge about these projects whatever anyone can find on the internet about these projects is all I have access to three I have no idea if we are actually going to experience a huge altcoin bull run the market could be be manipulated upwards or downwards some unforeseen Black Swan event could cause it all to come crashing down a glitch or huge hack could send us spiraling into Oblivion World War III could break out and kill us all a pandemic could break out and kill us all at the end of the day no one really knows how the crypto markets are going to behave throughout the rest of this year and through 2025 four we all need to assess our own personal unique Financial situations as well as our risk tolerance some people are living paycheck to paycheck some people have spouses kids and pets that rely on them financially some people have a ton of money to throw around with no dependence some people are risk averse and wouldn't be able to get any sleep at night or relax because watching this insane Market terrifies them While others don't feel anything when their portfolios drop 90% or to zero some people are young and have time on their side While others are older no longer working and maybe have a fixed amount of money they need to protect in order to live out the rest of their lives so assess yourself remember the number one rule of gambling crypto never ever gamble more than you can afford to lose five no one can have all the cryptocurrencies there are tens of thousands of them and if you overd diversify into too many of them you are not going to experience as much upside potential so if you're working with $1100 stick to one or two plays if you're working with $11,000 stick to three to six plays $10,000 6 to 12 plays Etc nice and six the most important thing to keep in mind mind is If you experience gains along the way take profits taking profits in the crypto markets is when you are up in a cryptocurrency position and you sell some of it and either convert it into Bitcoin to hold for the long term or you sell some of it for stable coin or cash to diversify into other Investments like stocks real estate or similar or you use the cash to pay off debt or maybe you buy something nice for yourself or use the cash for an experience like a vacation one profit taking strategy may be that once you double your Investments you decide to take out the initial investment for example if you bought $100 worth of a cryptocurrency and the value doubles to 200 then you sell the initial 100 you invested for Bitcoin a stable coin cash or whatever and let the $100 worth of gain stay in the market longer and hopes that it continues to increase another strategy could be that for every 50% increase you sell 25% of it for example if you bought $100 worth of a cryptocurrency and the value increases to $150 then you sell $25 worth basically a profit taking strategy is something everyone needs to decide based on our own unique Financial situations as well as our risk profiles do not be that person that watches a couple hundred bucks turn into a quar million bucks on their coinbase app on their cell phone screen who never sells anything and watches it go to zero I have been that person do not be that person brilliant now that we are all on the same page let's take a look at what alt coins I've got my eye on and I'm considering rolling the Dyson in no particular order note these are all in the gaming and AI space because as we've discussed on the channel these are narratives I'm betting will potentially perform well and just FYI when referencing the video I posted about things to consider to give us an edge in this market when choosing altcoins almost all of these are new to this cycle so not a lot of sell pressure to overcome as the prices hopefully potentially increase in this potential Bull Run they are a part of narratives that I'm betting will potentially perform well which includes gaming and AI I'm using the Morales money tool to decide when to buy and sell positions I choose to take and a lot of these cryptos have been mentioned by big channels in the space with large audiences which give the projects more exposure and potentially helps them perform better all right let's go 0x0 zx0 is an all-in-one privacy exchange featuring a variety of AI based safety tools that redistributes 100% Revenue to zx0 Holders it's currently at 13 cents and in a bearish trend on the weekly using the Morales money line tool once it closes above 23 C it will flip into a bullish Trend at which point may or may not be a decent time to consider getting into a position again with the Moralis money line tool the strategy is when a trend flips from bearish to bullish it may signal a bottom so a good time to buy and when the trend flips from bullish to bearish it may signal a top so a good time to sell cool next pal AI pal is a powerful AI ecosystem that allows us to create and integrate a Advanced crypto and AI Bots with telegram Discord or anywhere else to provide insights and analytics it's currently at 21 cents and in a bearish trend once it closes above 35 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend Destra network dsync is the first onchain One-Stop solution for cloud Ai and dpin or decentralized physical infrastructure needs as we can see from the chart this is a very new project not a lot of pricing data to analyze for Trends yet so definitely something to keep an eye on right now next artificial superintelligence Alliance or fet fetch.ai allows us to develop deploy and manage multi-agent systems in an open AI agent Marketplace it's currently at $138 and in a bearish trend once it closes above $164 it will flip into a bullish Trend node AI or GPU this service allows us to rent or lend GPU power to help scale Ai and machine learning processes quickly easily and cost effectively as we can see from the chart this is also a very new project not a lot of pricing data to analyze for Trends yet so keep an eye on it next aoz network aiio is decentralized physical infrastructure for AI Computing fast reliable web 3 data storage web 3 video streaming and more it's currently at 49 cents and in a bearish trend once it closes above 65 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend amazing so those were the projects I'm watching within the AI narrative this potential altcoin Bull Run next up are the gaming plays first we need to make sure our crypto is secure throughout this bull market in ways that make implementing our altcoin strategies safer and more convenient with different Hardware wallets to diversify technological risk tangum wallet is a set of three cards that work just like a set of three house keys that function as backups it's by far the easiest crypto Hardware wallet to set up and use it literally only takes about a minute it's the size of a credit card that fits perfectly in our day-to-day wallets and functions more like a daily wallet we can use to safely store our crypto and have instant access to buy sell trade and transact crypto on the Fly while Ledger offers premium crypto Hardware wallet options like Ledger stacks and flex devices these wallets function more like a safe or bank account and that they have extra security features to protect our long-term crypto Holdings they are the first of their kind as a new crypto wallet category which is a secure touchcreen featuring a full keyboard and keypad making it super user friendly watch a full of them in this video and Ledger is offering our community the best discount available on the market that comes with $10 worth of free Bitcoin for a limited time so be sure to scroll down and use links blow to redeem all the special offers they have for us amazing on to the crypto gaming plays Beam Beam is a sovereign Network focused on becoming the foundational infrastructure for Next Generation gaming it's currently at 1 cent in an embarrass Trend once it closes above 2 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend sweet immutable X IMX is a web 3 gaming platform for Next Generation gaming similar to beam except it's built on the ethereum network it's currently at 1 cent and in a bearish trend and once it closes above 2 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend next up superverse superverse is working towards turning web 3 gaming into a coordinated movement with a native blockchain Network tailored for gaming and a Global Network of gaming partners and players focused on Distributing nextg games it's currently at ad 28 and in a bullish Trend since the end of September last month it wouldn't drop into a bearish trend unless it closes a week under 90 so maybe something worth checking out cool echon prime prime is a platform that enables games to leverage blockchain features with frictionless prime token utility that allows game developers to enhance players experiences it's currently at $910 and in a bearish trend once it closes above $11.70 it will flip into to a bullish trend xborg xbg is building the world's largest player identity protocol xborg ID a passport players can use across all export powered apps in games to earn rewards and access to Unique experiences based on their Online achievements as we can see from the chart this is a very new project not a lot of pricing data to analyze for Trends yet so definitely something to keep an eye on right now all right last but not least this isn't an AI or gaming play it's a straight up SL BL pull on what I am gambling maybe one of the most popular meme coins this cycle Pepe Pepe does nothing it has no utility it's literally a joke it's based off of an internet meme it's currently at 0.009 C and in a bearish trend once it closes above 0.00001 Cent it will flip into a bullish Trend well there you have it I've shown my cards I've got my dice in hand ready to throw down some cash I am 100 % fully prepared and able to lose at the crypto Casino when or if another altcoin Bull Run

longterm, oxo Tokenomics,  #oxo #0x0 #crypto","what is going on with the 0x0 token it's up almost 50% today who's actually buying here who's selling here and why let's have a look at onchain analytics most people are not considering let's try to figure out whether or not the current really can potentially last longer because this is how we can make money in crypto we have to know more than others we need to have an edge everybody can draw random lines on charts right this is not how we can pick better bottoms and better tops I believe it's better to look at what's happening behind the price action now here is what's currently going on we are up 48% in the last 24 hours alone and we've got a massive overhang of buyers 79% of buyers versus only 21% of Sellers and of course we also see that overhang in the US dollar volume 78% of buying volume versus 22% of selling volume so it seems like at least today the large wallets AR selling otherwise the selling volume would be more balanced with the buying volume and the selling transactions would be larger in US Dollars that's not what we currently see now here's why everybody gets so excited about Oxo it's the Privacy coin play so it's a token all revolving around privacy all of the revenue of the application gets distributed to the Token holders and here's the big news around privacy coins it's revolving around tornado cash so a mixer on the ethereum Chain the office of foreign asset controls has exceeded the authority in other words tornado cash doesn't have to worry that much anymore now let's look at two things let's look at the social metrics and let's also look at the onchain metrics in the socials we can sometimes determine whether or not there's some kind of obvious manipulation going on so here we've got the Twitter account and over here we've got 42,000 followers now in telegram we've got 6,000 subscribers and on chain we've got 33,000 holders so this all kind of makes sense yes it is surprising that the number of Twitter followers is larger than the number of holders on chain but this could simply be users of the platform not necessarily owners of the token now this month we've seen two waves of attention have a look at the number of new users over time that peaked on the 8th of November and it peaked on the 23rd of November we also see how the number of new users versus returning users peaked at similar points in time in other words crypto runs in waves surprise surprise we see something very similar for the number of buyers and sellers over time ideally you want to be buying when the tension is low and you want to be selling when attention is high currently it's rather High imagine you would have bought somewhere around here the beginning of September of this year that was when the price was over here and then of course we see our two attention waves and now we are rather high on the attention front again but here's probably the most useful of the charts it's a count of the number of retail investors versus whale investors and the way this distinction is made is by minimum holding thresholds so how many tokens are in a wallet on the left side that's at minimum 5,000 so at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token a bit less than that in the middle that's 50,000 so that's not $10,000 worth of the token and on the right it's $100,000 worth of the token we see continued accumulation by small retail we see how the accumulation slowed down somewhat for the larger retail and we can see how the whales continue to sell over time so when those sell-offs here happen right when the token crashes by 60% over here by 40% this is not retail selling this is the Wales taking profit and so this seems to be the ideal token to trade in a Range as long as the number of retail investors continues to grow whenever the price is depressed it makes sense to buy when now the price is very very high and the whales continue to dump that's not necessarily the best entry point now here's the thing I believe that most upside potential is in the small market cap tokens and it's especially in the mem coins have a look at this in the last 7 days what performed the best it's all meme coins and it's hundreds of percent potentially we talked about chill guy early on this channel we talked about bully early on this channel we also talked about the tits token early on this channel so feel free to follow here because here's the problem once a token Rises to a certain market cap it takes a lot of capital again to double and triple the token and especially for meme coins that do have a lot of risk that can easily go down by 50 60 0% you do still want to see the upside potential and so when the market cap is already pretty high in the billions of dollars then there is not that much upside potential but there's still the downside potential so the risk versus reward isn't that great have a look at this this is the largest meme coins in the last week pretty much everything went down only Dogecoin went slightly up so once a mem coin has risen to a certain level it's time to be cautious it might make sense to go into the tokens that are not in the billions but only in the tens of million ions maybe hundreds of millions but the question is always how can we pick the right small meme coin right there are so many small mem coins how do we not get burned and I believe the answer to this is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and once we've got a wallet of a certain influencer of somebody that moves markets of somebody that is a top Trader of somebody that did do the right things in the past once we have those wallets we've got a very nice mechanism to filter what to buy and what to sell have look at this so this is Martini guy and he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 so that was even before the listing on radium so that was directly on the pump. fun ecosystem platform when he bought his position went up by more than 4,000% of course it subsequently collapsed but that's the idea of trading right you don't just want to buy and hold meme coins meme coins are a rotation game you want to be in as long as the momentum is positive and you want to exit very quickly once it turns around I have a look at this here another alert by the martini guy he bought the fattiest token again directly on pump fun and again a very similar development so the purchase happened directly on the platform subsequently the price went up by 1, 680% and then came crashing back down now what's important with buying tokens that early with tracking other influencers is that first of all we have to take profit but secondly also we have to be somewhat Di Diversified we can't bet half of our portfolio on a single bet this is very risk on so here again the martini guy he bought chippy and that was at 2022 here are his purchases now it's at 206 so there are trades that don't necessarily always work out it is a game of Risk versus reward you want to buy when the upside is still there you don't want to buy the meme coins that are in the billions of dollars but when going risk on like this it's more important them with any other strategy not to lose everything right it's important to make small bets every now and then and then take profit when those make multiple X returns and so that's why I made several tutorial videos on the topic on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification of course also on unchain tracking Etc now I've talked about him now often enough so here is that guy this is Martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers and we track 12 of his wallets we did this through onchain analytics we found out some of his wallets now check this out this is Alex Becka's Channel we also track his wallets he's got 1.5 million subscribers now when he talks about a token it puts that much attention on the token that of course the price has to rise we've got also 12 of his wallets we're also tracking Crypt Benta with 1.1 million subscribers we've got 33 of their wallets and so I really believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's not just buying random tokens that are funny that are in some kind of list of trending tokens I think it's much more important to follow the Insiders it's to follow the early money it's to follow the people that have more attention that can push prices higher I like this strategy of wallet tracking that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course on just that so it's eight videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to discuss our onchain analytics we have to compare what kind of conclusions we come to that's why we've got our dedicated Chets on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you now does it still make sense to buy the token now at roughly 20 cents potentially right the current momentum is still positive but it is important to set somewhat maybe of a trailing stop- loss as in when the price action turn turns around to exit very very quickly because unfortunately the Wales they tend to sell quite continuously I think it is safer to buy the token when it's relatively low in its trading range and at that point to continue looking at whether or not retail continues to buy if retail continues to adopt further right if they continue to buy even during the be and when the price is depressed that's probably the right time to buy because then the Wales are probably not going to dump if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well if helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

Grass Price, Grass Price Prediction, Grass longterm, Grass Tokenomics,  #grass #cryptoai #crypto","I was thinking about making a video on grass already yesterday instead I simply watched the grass growing let's have a look at some onchain analytics let's try to figure out how much longer this really can last and whether or not this is all sustainable now since the 28th of October already grass is a trending token on coin gecko it's up more than 40% today 170% this week and 240% since listing on coin market cap which was on the 28 of October now we have to be aware that when we look at the onchain analytics for grass that we're not going to get the full picture because there is already quite a bit of trading volume on the centralized exchanges and those centralized exchanges are pretty much black boxes we can't really see what's going on over there so most trading happens on Digi Phenix not the most common centralized exchange on the planet but then comes gate.io and we've got bit htx Mexi and Qin but we do have trading directly on the Solana chain as well grass is part of the trending tokens it's not the largest one but it's at number 25 in terms of liquidity there's $835,000 in the liquidity pool now here are the reasons why I initially ignored grass it's the security warnings so deck screener shows us directly at the top this token is minable it also shows us Below in the audit a minable flag on Dex tools. we've only got a DEX score of 61 again this is relating to the security we've got scam risk by quick Intel and again we've got the token minable and blacklisted but it appears as if those kind of warnings aren't too much of a problem again a lot of centralized exchangers have already subscribed to the Token now here's the website of grass AI the USP is kind of a mixture between betting on AI and betting on resource optimization by selling your unused internet now how legitimate are those 2 and a half million users we will see let's see how many views this video gets on the Twitter platform we've got 490,000 followers on the Discord Channel we've got 400,000 members so this seems to all kind of align now grass made an air drop and because of that there's more than 300,000 holders on the Solana chain now not all of those holders are created equally let's have a look at the number of followers that have some kind of significant capital in this on the left side we've got the retail investors on the right side we've got the whale investors and we distinguish this by the number of tokens that are hold at minimum so it's 500 for the left which is currently roughly $11,000 it's 5,000 in the middle which is currently roughly $10,000 and 50,000 tokens on the right so that's $100,000 we can see how the airdrop increased the number of holders to roughly 3,000 so roughly 1% of all of the holders have more than $11,000 in it 99% of wallets have less than $1,000 and we can then see how a lot of those holders sold off their airdrop we see that for the larger wallets we see less of a sell off and we see that for the Wales we even saw some accumulation zero sell off whatsoever now this is fascinating usually we see how retail continues to buy and hold a token and how the Wales tend to sell into a rally this time it seems like the whales know something that retail doesn't I strongly believe that crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more skill somebody has the more Capital gets ACR over time thus the whales tend to make the better calls they have made better calls in the past when they are not selling what the small wallets do that's potentially positive now we can see that after the airdrop the excitement around the token is going down the number of firsttime Traders per day isn't as high anymore so is the number of recurring Traders we also see how the number of token transactions tends to decline the trading volume though isn't really changing that much in other words the people that are still around continue trading and it appears as if it's the heavyweights that are dominating that trading and when we look at the split up who's actually dominating the recent trading it's mainly the Wales and large retail now it looks like grass is a heavily supported project by the centralized exchanges thus it's not really clear where the price will go the centralized exchanges have pretty much all the power have a look at who's holding the value here when we look at the token balance pretty much all of it is held by the Wales 98.7% and when we exclude those whales we can see that the small retail investors rather sell off their airdrop how ever the centralized exchanges the market makers the Wales of this world they continue pumping up the token how else is it possible that less and less tokens are held by the small people while the price is on a massive run yes grass is a trending token on Solana but it's definitely not a heavyweight on chain the largest of the liquidity pools is only $800,000 worth if we add this all together it's a bit over a million put this into relation to how much value the whales are holding that's too billion worth of the token and so I don't really dare to predict where the price is going unfortunately we do not have transparent data here there's probably going to be a lot of manipulation through derivatives through all kinds of means from the centralized exchanges this really can continue longer simply just to bring on more attention onto the token to get some of the retail investors to buy in now I prefer the bets where there is clear transparency and I want to see smart money buying into a token for example here in premium we are tracking more than 400 influencers more than 400 top Traders and the only signals I can get on grass is how the influencers that we are tracking sold their tokens for example over here a Lim or IL Alim one crypto Channel with 70,000 subscribers another one with 344,000 they simply just received the token and then swapped out of it and so yes in theory there is some upside potential because if you just compare market caps grass is still rather small so here's a list of AI related tokens and the graph for example is three times larger render which is probably the most direct competitor is 3 to four times larger and when we look at fetch AI which has rebranded to artificial super intelligence Alliance that's a 6X from where we are currently which would put grass at more than $15 call me conservative but I prefer to trade in the ecosystem that currently has most growth and it has most attention and that is fortunately or not the meme coins at the moment and so when I look at the wallets that we're tracking in premium I see mainly meme coins for example over here the goat token was bought by Kyle Chessie on the 14th of October for 13 since he bought the price went up by almost 500% but check this out frock also bought by Kyle chesse he scooped up the token on the day of launch and it went up by more than 3,000% and so we've got 12 of his wallets but in total we track more than 400 wallets I believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's following the smart money it's following the people that did the right calls in the past and that are likely going to do them in the future as well I like to follow influencers that can potentially move markets as well right the influencers with hundreds of thousands potentially even millions of subscribers there's an entire tutorial course in premium on how to find different influencer wallets how to then track them and how to afterwards interpret the signals that we get from tracking there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total not just on wallet tracking but also on onchain analytics on risk RK Management on portfolio diversification Etc and so we are discussing our wallet findings in dedicated chats but of course we are also discussing individual alt coins in dedicated chat so then figure out when an influencer is bought at what point in time do we want to sell so feel free to check it out it's $25 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so I'm personally not buying grass right now even though I do believe that the token will get manipulated up further but the question really is at what point in time would we then sell the upside I think is at $15 beyond that beating render is not that likely and so as an addition to a somewhat Diversified altcoin portfolio it might make sense but I don't think it makes sense to bet the whole Farm on it hope you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this video a like it helps the channel grow see you on the next

to let you guys know how much your jasmi coin will be worth if you're holding a particular amount of tokens well in this video we we have number of tokens suppose if you're bu holding let's say 2,000 5,000 8,000 10,000 30,000 50,000 or 100,000 jasm tokens how much your tokens are worth at the current price which is 0.0 42 and these are the current valuations at the price which is 80 if you're holding 2,000 coins they're worth 84 5,210 uh $8,000 coins $336 $10,000 coins $420 30,000 coins $1,260 $50,000 coins $2,100 $ 100,000 coins are worth $4,200 at the current price well this is at the current price we will be doing calculations at different values suppose if your jasm coin value reaches 10x 20x 30X 50x or and massive 100x this these will be the values so I will reveal the values as we move forward in the video and before we talk about the calculations first take a look at the market so the overall crypto Market is looking pretty good we have lots of green on the market and jasmi is still trying to go up jasmi is up a whooping 80% on the weekly and we are about to 2x from its last week price which is amazing it's moving at very fast speed and I think jasmi is going to overtake hbar Iota and other big coins very soon it can even outperform xrp we will talk about that later in the video now let's take a look at jasmi coin to economics So currently jasmi is sitting at a market cap of $2 billion and we are up 40% from the previous day and we are seeing a massive surge in volume that means that we are getting a lot of interest for this coin in the market and the volume is up 189 percentage which is absolutely amazing almost all the tokens are out of the supply all the 50 billion jasmi coins are now in the circulation which means that jasmi coin is becoming more scarce day by day and the good thing about jasmi is if you guys don't know jasmi coin is known as the Bitcoin of Japan and jasmi is one of the top cryptos right now and this is the reason why I am so bullish on jasi so guys the reason why I'm making this video is I did a post from my ex account asking would you retire if jasmi hits $1 which is 32x from the current price and that post has done very well the post has actually gone viral we have lots of likes and lots of you commented on the post so if you want you can follow me on Twitter at the trader foxy YT and if you want you can join our Discord group Link in description and this is where I share my analysis before I even post it on Twitter so if you want you can join our Discord group we have lots and lots of value in there and now let's get straight into the part of the video because I know you're here to know the price predictions so so let's start this So currently jasmi coin is worth at $0.02 and if you have 2,000 tokens the current value is 84 bucks and if it 10x from here your tokens will be worth $840 if it goes 20x your tokens will be worth 1,680 if it does 30X your tokens will be worth 2520 if it does 50x your tokens will be worth 4,200 and if it does 100x your tokens will be worth 8,400 now let's move on on to the next one and now if you have 5,000 jasmi coins at current price those are worth $210 and if it does a 10x you will have $2,100 if it does a 20x you will have $4,200 if it does a 30X you will have $6,300 if it does a 50x you will have $10,500 and if it does a 100x you will have $21,000 now let's move on to the next one now if you have 8,000 jasmi coins at the current jasmi price your tokens are worth $336 and if it does a 10x from here it will be worth $3,360 if it does a 20x from here your tokens will be worth $ 6,720 and if it does a 30X from here your tokens will be worth $1,080 if it does a 50x from here your tokens will be worth $6,800 and if it does a 100x from here your tokens will be worth $33,600 now let's move on to the next one and now if you have $10,000 at the current price price your token's current value is $420 and if it does a 10x from here those will be $4,200 if it does a 20x from here your tokens will be worth $8,400 and if it does a 30X from here your tokens will be worth $12,600 and if it does a 50x from here your tokens will be worth $21,000 and if it does a 100x from here your tokens will be worth $42,000 now let's move on to the next one and now it's getting juice here and now if you have 30,000 jasmi tokens at the current price your tokens are worth $1,260 at the current price and if it does a 10x from here your tokens will be worth $12,600 if it does a 20x from here your tokens will be worth $25,200 if it does a 30X from here your tokens will be worth $37,800 if it does a 50x from here your tokens will be worth $63,000 and if it does a 100x from here your tokens will be worth $126,000 now this is getting crazier and $1,260 is not even a lot of amount to invest in but you're still getting significant amount of returns from the jasmi coins and now if you have 50,000 jasmi coins at the current price they're worth $2,100 and if it does a 10x from here those will be worth $21,000 if it does a 20x from here your tokens will be worth $42,000 from here if it does does a 30X your tokens will be worth $63,000 if it does a 50x it will be worth $115,000 and if it does 100x from here your 50,000 tokens will be worth $210,000 now things are getting even crazy and now it's going to go even crazier now if you have 100,000 jasmi tokens at the current price they're worth $4200 and if it does a 10x from here your tokens will be worth $42,000 if it does a 20x from here your tokens will be worth $84,000 and if it does a 30X from here your tokens will be worth $126,000 and if it's doing a 50x from this price your tokens will be worth $210,000 and now it's time for The Banger and if you have 100,000 jasmie coins and if it does a 100x from the current price your tokens will be worth a warping $420,000 almost half a million so you see how much your tokens will be worth if you buy at the current price in different amount of tokens and the these are the values at the current price these are the values at 10x these are the values at 20x these are the value at 30X and these are the value at 50x and 100x this was a simple

gets very close to the 100K and thus it's not just Bitcoin that's going up it's also the altcoins especially the meme coins let's have a look at cerebro in this video we're going to look at onchain analytics we're going to look at the buyers and sellers we're going to look at what's currently driving the price to then derive whether or not it still makes sense to buy Zer bro now owning Bitcoin is nice and all but the real profits are to be made in the smaller tokens just have a look at this in the last 7 days a lot of tokens went up by hundreds of perc whip even doubled today Project 89 more than doubled and have a look at this right those are all rather small cap cryptocurrencies this is not in the billions this is actually where currently all the gains are made now I published a video on Sero before on this channel and it just performed like your average video so an average video is indicated here by this gray area yet at the time the price was 7.7 and now we are at 53 cents and so I cover meme coins regularly on this channel I always try to pick the ones that have positive momentum but that still have some kind of further upside potential so if you don't want to miss the next one feel free to subscribe here now zibro is a token that had been LED via pump. fun so the mem coin launch pad on Solana and it's currently got 22,000 holders on the Chain but not all of those holders are created equal some of them have just a few dollars worth of the token others have hundreds of thousands of dollars and and so let's have a look at what those different kinds of holders are currently doing on the left side we've got the retail investor on the right side we've got the whale investor in the middle we've got something in between so what we're seeing here is the number of wallets over time based on minimum holding thresholds so on the left side that's 2,000 tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token they're currently 6,000 such wallets the minimum holding for the wallet in the middle is 20,000 tokens so $10,000 worth of the token we have 2,200 such wallets and on the right we've got the Wales so we got another 10x that's now $100,000 worth of the token there are 563 such wallets and so this is exactly the kind of chart we want to see we have a very constant nice accumulation by the small retail investor we've got also consistent accumulation by mediumsized and even the whales they are not dumping despite the price going up now what's also interesting is not just the number of holders it's also how many new people come in especially relative to the recurring Traders so we look at now how many new wallets are created every day that trade with the token versus how many recurring trades do we see and that's visible here on the left chart now on the right chart we've got the number of token transactions that's a measure of how much attention there currently is on the token and so the firsttime Traders are here in purple on the left and on most days we see more first time Traders then recurring Traders this is exactly what we want to see we want to see a growing investor base and we don't want that existing Traders dump on each other now on the right side we've got the number of token transactions that peaked on the 10th of November and is now at a somewhat constant level probably one of the most insightful charts is over here on the left side we see the trading volume over time on the right side we see again the trading volume but this time normalized to 100% per day and we are now segregating again by those different wallet cohorts and we see very nice constant increase of trading volume this is exactly what we want to see this means increased attention but what we also see is that over time the larger wallets tend to trade more and more relatively speaking so even though the number of Wales isn't growing as quickly as the number of small retail investors it seems like their dollar cost averaging in heavier they make up more and more of the trading volume and that could mean that maybe a market maker is also part of one of those larger wallets and that could then potentially mean a listing on a centralized exchange because still most trading volume happens in a decentralized manner the token is listed on pretty much everything is listed on Maxi but they don't do much Market making they mainly just funnel orders through the actual price Discovery still happens on chain on Solana and so we can have a look at how much value is held by the different wallet cohorts and again we see a very fast accumulation by the Wales this went here from the 7th of November from 14 million to currently 57 million so the holding increased by 36x now compare this with small retail they mooved from 300K to 22 million so that's maybe a 7x roughly small retail accumulated much slower than the Wales yet over time the number of holders of course is increasing and that kind of data makes me rather bullish on the token now the big question is always how can we find something like zerro when it's not at 500 million in market cap but when it's still relatively small maybe at 50 million or 70 million right in the tens of millions not in the hundreds of millions this is where most of the gains are made now my answer to this question is wallet tracking have a look at this we got an alert by Kyle chesse that he bought zbro at 7.8 he did this in two transactions and since then the price went up by more than 500% so I don't think the best approach to crypto trading is necessarily just picking a random token in a list and just looking at where's currently the movement happening I think the best approach is to follow the smart money it's to follow the influencers it's to follow the Insiders is to follow the people that actually move markets and tend to make profitable trades and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 136,000 subscribers and we are tracking 12 of his wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets so for example we also track Crypt banter they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they mention a token the price definitely goes up because again attention is moved towards that token and more attention means more trading volume means more purchases means a higher price and so we've got 30 33 of Crypt benter wallets and so really I believe this is the way to make alpha in crypto it's trying to find information sources most people don't have it's digging a bit deeper than others it's following the smart money and so I like this wallet approach that much that I created a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track those influencer wallets and how can we subsequently interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com it's not just about wallet tracking we've also got onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about back testing it's also about risk management and portfolio diversification there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total and so once we've got a signal of course you also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to compare our analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so do I believe that cerebra will go higher it's definitely possible the upside is somewhat limited because we are already in the hundreds of millions not anymore in the tens of millions of dollars if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I pra you a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKUQyETOJLo,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'Maker', 'JUST', 'Zerebro',

building an ecosystem on top of the already rallying pump. fun ecosystem that might accelerate gains even quicker now what we've got over here is the price chart of Euro lead teen a it's up more than 100% today and still has a market cap of only roughly 60 million and this token comes from pump. science so that's a platform that makes experiments on top of pump. fun there are currently two tokens rium pinin and Tin a now here is what's frustrating about YouTube when we talk about a token that's not yet that well known that's rather small then the videos tend to not perform that well right nobody knows about them once a token has ried and once a token is already expensive that's then the kind of videos that YouTube serves to everyone here have a look at this this is the performance of riam penene it has been published yesterday and it underperformed the average video by a lot at the time the price was still at 7 cents and now we are at 18 cents and so I sometimes get these comments right why are you publishing a video when the token is already expensive but it's actually not true it's simply just that YouTube doesn't send out those videos to the subscribers or even to the people outside of the subscriber base and so if you want to spot those tokens early right if at least you want to consider those tokens early feel free to subscribe here potentially even hit hit the notification Bell because otherwise you might not even get those videos now pretty much everything went up in pump. fun in the last 7 Days the largest of the tokens even made more than a 4X but also smaller tokens have quite a bit of momentum here more than a 10x for fret for disclosure I am a holder of fret now let's go into the details of the Euro token let's look at the onchain analytics let's try to figure out what's driving this R and how much longer this R can potentially last what we've got over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders per day that's on the left and on the right side we've got the number of token transactions per day and since the day hasn't yet finished we can ignore the very last data point we see that the number of firsttime Traders exceeds the number of recurring Traders by a lot every single day so far we can also see that the token transaction code is relatively elevated now this is what mem coin trading is all about right it's about buying tokens where the investor base is growing because as investor base grows as there's more more new first-time Traders in a token the price tends to stabilize at a higher level now let's have a look at the trading volume who's currently dominating that trading volume and how did this develop over time on the left side we've got this in US Dollar on the right side we've got this normalized to 100% per day and yes the launch on pump. science of course created a lot of attention but what we can also see is that over time more and more trading volume goes towards large retail and Wales now small retail is simply all the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and the Wales is above 100,000 adoption by the larger wallets is a positive thing because that shows us that the smart money is getting in right the whales have more money because they played this game for a while and crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more you play this game of course the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so over time money Acres towards the skilled people so when you follow the whales we tend to follow the skilled people now we can also count the number of retail investors versus whale investors this time not measured in US but measured in the number of tokens so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least ‚Ç¨ 20,000 Euro tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token on the chart in the middle we got a 10x in minimum holding so that's not $10,000 worth of the token and on the right another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we see a very quick massive growth by small retail and we also see that growth across the Wales but the number of Wales actually went down in the last days now what's going on here this is actually somewhat confusing C the existing whes that are still there they dollar cost average into the token they buy up more and more and that's what we see over here on this chart the Wales and large retail tends to own more and more of the overall token balance small retail so the wallets with less than ,000 worth of the token only have 4% of the supply medium-sized retail has 16% of the supply so what could be going on here is that the whales are buying up the token maybe in speculation that it will be listed at some point by the centralized exchanges and whenever a token a pump. fund ecosystem token gets listed for example on binance the price goes absolutely parabolic and so I am very bullish on the overall crypto market right now the stable coin market cap continues to increase and that means that more more money is Flowing from traditional Finance into the crypto world right those tokens get generated whenever Fiat gets deposited for example in the tether accounts what we see over here is the teral Luna collapse when the anchor protocol went bust subsequently we also had FTX going down and then we've seen a turn around when we turned bullish again in October of last year since then we see expanding crypto prices and this is recently accelerating and so again the pump. fun ecosystem is doing the best across all categories in crypto at the moment and the big question is how can we find those top performers early how is it possible for example to get the peanut token when it's not at a few dollars but at a few cents so now peanut is at $166 it's the largest of the pump fun ecosystem tokens and I made a video on Peanut when the price was still 11 cents now how did I learn about peanut that early the answer is wallet tracking the blockchain is 100% transparent we can actually see who's buying and who's selling something and have a look at this signal this is Crypt banter who bought the peanut token at only 3 cents since then the price went up by more than 5,000% and so here is Crypt Benta it's one of the largest crypto channels on YouTube they've got 1.1 million subscribers and when big influencers buy a token and when they then talk about the token in their YouTube channel of course this generates a lot of attention and of course this translates into higher prices so the art is to try to copy trate the Insiders is to try to copy trate the people that tend to make the money it's to try to copy trate the people that have impact on the market we don't just track Crypt benter we also track Alex Becker have a look at this we've got 12 of his wallets in total we track more than 400 and so this is his channel he's got 1.5 million subscribers almost and so really instead of just picking random meme coins in a list it's better to follow the smart money that's why I also have a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it's eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them and how to subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking and so this is all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about back testing it's also about portfolio diversification and risk management so there's more than 100 videos in total feel free to check it out and so once we've got a wallet signal we also need to discuss of course when should we buy when should we sell we need to compare the different analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first 7even days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I'm quite bullish on the pump. science ecosystem I believe that that the next launch is probably going to Rally even further if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I praise youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

Price, Bonk Price Prediction, Bonk longterm, Bonk Tokenomics,  #Bonk #memecoin #crypto","after weeks of waiting what I'm saying after months of waiting Bonk is finally hitting a new all-time high let's have a look at how much longer this really can last using onchain analytics let's try to look behind the price data now we're currently up 12% today this week we went up by almost 70% and initially the month didn't go as planned but now we're picking up in some we are up 130% almost this month but again things were not smooth we had a bit of a roll roller coaster right in between let's see what happened here and let's see whether or not we are coming back down again now I am publishing videos on Bon regularly on this channel and the very first video was published more than a year ago to be precise 372 years ago and that video already outperformed an average video and up to this day it still gets some views now at the time the price was at 543 now we are at 455 so more than a 10x and so I'm trying to be early on this channel I try to publish videos on Meme coins that have positive momentum that do have potential more upside if you don't want to miss the next video Fe you to subscribe feel free to potentially even hit the notifications now let's go into the onchain analytics of Bon onchain we've got 820,000 holders and within the memec coin Universe Bonk is the largest on the Solana chain Dogecoin is its own token Shea Eno and P are on ethereum and so this gives us a first idea of what the potential upside is if B was to do another 10x from here it would be very close to Dogecoin with a doubling it would already go to number three with a quadrupling it would be close to shiino now since the market caps are so large it is important how much Capital there is on ethereum versus Solana there is some kind of Tailwind here because in the last 2 years Solana outperformed ethereum quite a bit by 84% and this is likely going to continue there's more and more activity on Solana ethereum is getting crushed and part of the reason is the lackluster performance of ethereum relative to bitcoin since the move from proof of work to proof of stake in under performance of more than 60% and so it's not unreasonable to play with that scenario that at one point in time the largest meme coin across all chains could be on Solana and not on ethereum anymore so that would bring us a 3 to4x to cross shba Eno now with those various launches across the Bon ecosystem and with the listings on centralized exchanges Etc the number of H us over time those kind of graphs look quite skewed and initially I thought this is manipulation but I'm not so sure I think those are simply transactions from market makers to and from centralized exchanges now on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 20 million Bonk tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token so there are 40,000 or to be more exact 42,000 wallets that have that kind of capital in Bon on chain if you go another 10 X in minimum holding so 200 million tokens we are at 9,400 wallets another 10x which brings us to around $100,000 worth of the token we've got 2,600 such wallets now we can see how all of those wallet cohorts are recently accumulating and that accumulation happened pretty much since the beginning of the month across the board we can also see how there is ever Rising interest in Bonk on the left side we see the number of recurring versus new Traders per day on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day and both of this is rising very nicely but of course there is a danger in buying something that's already quite hyped right whenever attention shifts to other assets then of course the price could also potentially bleed and so this is how it goes on the left side we see the US dollar trading volume per day on the right side we see this normalized to 100% every day and we can clearly see how attention for Bonk comes in waves it goes up and down and up up and down and currently we are obviously very high on attention we can also see that over time the small retail investor tends to have less and less of the trading volume and the larger investors tend to have more and more of a say in the trading volume and so here's likely a chart you have never seen before when we bet on Bon we are betting on the Solana ecosystem as well but we also want to outperform Solana right otherwise we can simply just buy s Sol what we see over here is not the Bon US dollar price we see Bon measured in so so Bon's performance relative to Solana and what's so interesting about this chart is that there seems to be some kind of a trading range not a perfect trading range but still sometimes trading volume is very very high sometimes it's rather low and whenever it's high the price also tends to be high currently if that trading range doesn't break then the upside isn't really that great compared to the downside now don't get me wrong I do believe that speculation on mem coins make a lot of sense right now because just have a look at the best performing crypto categories in the last 7 Days Zoo themed is at number one the pump. fun ecosystem which is a launch pad of mem coins on Solana is up by 89% those are the kinds of categories that perform the best right it's all memec coin related what's performing not so well it's defi it's lending and borrowing and liquid staking and reaking and crypto gaming Etc it's all about finding meme coins and ideally finding them early because have a look at the best performing meme coins in the last 7 Days those are all small market cap coins they are not in the billions they are in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but even over here the tokens that are in the hundreds of millions they all performed that well and you would have had to buy them when they were still in the tens of millions and so really the market seems to be splitting in two segments now we've got on the one hand the Bitcoin buyers right the Bitcoin dominance continues to rise Bitcoin becomes a more and more important part of crypto and on the other side we've got all the meme coin traders that want to outperform by 10 or 100x the middle is pretty much shrinking away the gamey tokens the Dy tokens dpin infrastructure it's all going down relative to bitcoin it's either meme coins or it's Bitcoin and ideally it's small cap mem coins but then there's the question right how can we find a token like peanut when it's not at a$1 63 but when it's just at a few cents how was I able to publish a video on Peanut when it was still at 11 cents the answer is wallet tracking I track various influencer wallets I track wallets of people that move markets I track wallets of insiders and check this out we've got crypto banter over here that bought the peanut token when it was still at 3 cents this is Crypt Benta they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they buy a token and when they then talk about the token to this large audience of course this generates a lot of attention and that attention at least partially moves into buys and so this is then how that developed the price went from 3 cents to $163 it's up more than 5,000% since then and it's all because of the wallet tracking it's all because we've got some of the wallets that they trade with in total we track 33 wallets of Crypt Benta but it's not just Crypt Benta that we are tracking we also track Alex Becker we also track crypto gains we track various people in total we've got more than 421 wallets crypto is really not just a game of luck it also involves luck but it's a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more the expected value of a trade will shine through the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so the skilled people accumulate more Capital over time and so I like this wallet tracking strategy that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on that how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track them and how can we finally also interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about back testing it's also about risk mitigation and portfolio diversification there's more than 100 different tutorial videos in premium and so once we've got a buy or sell signal we have to discuss this that's why we've got dedicated altcoin chats as well so Fe free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so is it possible that Bon will go higher in US Dollars yes definitely because it's riding the Solana adoption and Solana is taking away more and more from ethereum is the current price very heated probably it is because Bon relative to Solana is quite expensive right now and it's unclear whether or not it can break out of the historical trading range I believe most upside is in the smaller meme coins I believe that most upside is in the pump. fun ecosystem especially the tokens that are in the tens of millions of dollars not in the billions of dollars if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Wz_ZJ3uJY,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana',

500% in the last 24 hours it's a pump. fun ecosystem token on the Solana chain how much longer can this really last let's have a look at onchain metrics let's also have a look at relative valuations let's try to figure out if it's still makes sense to buy chill guy now here are all the trending tokens on Solana ordered by their liquidity pool size and chill guy is currently at number 12 it's got a liquidity of almost 3 million and the market cap of 200 million and so here's an overview of the pump. fun ecosystem tokens chill guy launched less than 5 days ago and it's already at place number nine in terms of market cap a doubling would bring it close to mudang a tripling from the current price would already put it at number three larger than the ACT token which is already listed on binance and so today more than ,000 wallets interacted with the token we've got 50,000 buyers 27,000 Sellers and overhang of 64% but that's of course in terms of the participants in terms of buying and selling volume it's way more equal because again we are in a massive rally now this is a linear chart here here we've got the same on a logarithmic chart a very constant nice growth pattern now how much of this is manipulation potentially by some whales how much of this is organic growth by a lot of retail investors let's have a look at onchain data now how much of this is manipulation by Wales and how much of this is organic growth by by retail let's first have a look at Social metrics to try to figure out if the numbers align so on Twitter or the xplatform we've got roughly 7,000 followers on telegram we've got almost 8,000 members and on chain on the Solana blockchain we've got roughly 54,000 holders now not all of those holders are created equally let's have a look at the onchain metric on the left side we see the number of returning users versus new users per day on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day and we can see very nice constant growth and we see how the number of firsttime Traders which is in purple outpaces the number of recurring Traders for pretty much any day this is exactly what we want right we want a growing investor base because the more people buy into a token the higher the price can stabilize on the right side we see the number of token transactions and that's going even more parabolic this is growing even faster indicating that now potentially some automated trading might be entering as well now today is the 20th of November so this latest data point isn't yet finished we're likely going to see a new high but we're already seeing that new high in the number of token transactions and so what's then the growth of different wallet cohorts on the left side we've got the retail investor on the right side we've got the Wales and in the middle are the mediumsized investors now on the left side we simply look at these kind of minimum holding thresholds so we've got 5,000 tokens that need to be held at minimum to be counted into this chart now at the current price of chill guy that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $10,000 for the chart on the right another 10x so that's $100,000 worth of the token we can see how the growth of the number of whale wallets has pretty much stagnated since the 18th the number of retail wallets though more than doubled during the same time so it appears as if this rally is 100% driven by a lot of small wallets while the whales aren't yet net selling however we do see that over time more trading volume is done by those whales so check this out this is the trading volume in Dollar on the left and it's normalized to 100% per day on the right again very nice constant growth but we also see how large retail and how the whales tend to trade now more and more of the token small retail so again those are the wallets up to $11,000 they tend to trade less and less relatively speaking and so it seems like the whs are partially taking profit but it also seems like they're taking over more and more of the supply and the reason why they might be doing this the reason why the existing whes might be buying up more is because they could be speculating also on a centralized exchange listing currently the token is only traded in a decentralized manner but whenever a pump. fund ecosystem token gets listed on something like binance then the token can go to new levels again act got listed on binance it made a 3 to 4X upon listing same is true for the gold and the peanut token and so this is really the next step we are already at 200 million we are unlikely going to get to 400 or 600 100 million just by retail this is now all a speculation on a listing on centralized exchanges if that listing doesn't happen then the price is probably not going to do that well now the altcoin market as a whole is actually not doing that well all the gains are currently made in the pump. fund ecosystem or in meme coins in general right have a look at this pump. fun outperformed pretty much all the other cryptocurrency categories in the last 7 days it's up 89% and the big question is how can we actually pick tokens that are rallying before they become that large how can we buy for example peanut when it's just at a few cents and not at $161 or how can we buy something like goat again before it's at a dollar because for example check this out I made a video about goat when it was still at 24 cents so I tried to pick the tokens that currently have positive momentum but that still have some upside left and so initially that video actually did not perform that well afterwards once the price Rose of course the video outperformed as well and so that's the idea of this channel right I tried to pick the meme coins that have some potential and I try to be early so feel free to subscribe here right potentially even hit notifications because again the YouTube algorithm unfortunately is against us when a token is still small not a lot of people are actually searching for it then we don't see that much exposure on YouTube and so the big question is how can we find tokens like peanut early when it's just at a few cents and not at a few dollars I believe the answer is in wallet tracking it's finding the wallets by influencers by people that move markets by top Trad and looking very closely at when are they buying and selling for example over here we've got crypto banter that bought the peanut token at 3 cents and so here's the Crypt ventor YouTube channel they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token of course it generates attention and attention turns very often into buys and so this is what happened with the token right since that signal is up more than 5,000% and so I really believe that crypto is not just random gambling it's not just a game of luck it's a game of luck luck and skill and the more we play the game the more the expected value will shine through the less important the luck component becomes and the more important skill becomes the capital over time moves towards the people that are most skilled thus following the skilled people following the Insiders following the market makers I believe makes a lot of sense and that's why we've got 33 wallets by Crypt banter alone that we are following in total we follow more than 400 wallets I like this approach so much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on wallet tracking so how can we find various influencer wallets how can we subsequently track those wallets and how can we then interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of Premium the premium membership of this channel is down below the bitcoin.com but premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about back testing it's also about portfolio diversification it's about all kinds of things there's more than a 100 different tutorial videos in premium now once we have a signal we of course also need to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to compare our onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins in premium as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $15 US per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so yes I do believe that chill guy can go higher the question is though do we see that centralized exchange listing if we don't see that listing for the next days then probably the price will bleed at some point because then the Wales might take more profit if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeFcN36qPog,"['Solana', 'JUST',

bitcoin news today, crypto news, bitcoin price crash, btc analysis, litecoin, bitcoin btc, altcket  ‚Å© #india #crypto  #hindi",hello everyone welcome to another video of the crypto cult in today's video we will talk about token unlocks and how they affect the market and whether a token analog means that the price of any cryptocurrency will go up or down and how do you track these token unlocks this can be very very helpful for you guys if you are in the speculation market for cryptocurrencies also it is very good for people who want to buy up some tokens and want to see when the price will be low so let's first of all start with what are token unlocks and why do they happen so whenever you launch a new project or a new cryptocurrency project comes into the market there are a certain number of tokens that might be assigned to the developing team or the founders or might just be kept to be unlocked at a later stage of time so the tokens that are assigned to the development team or the founders have a particular time period called a wasting period wasting period basically means that a certain amount of time after which these tokens get unlocked and the founders and the development team can access them they can sell them or use them the wasting part is very important because if I start a cryptocurrency project and I have some tokens initially then I can just dump all of these token in the market and the price of that cryptocurrency will go down rapidly and the project might suffer that PR or worse it might die so that is the reason that tokens are locked in the first place and when these wasting time periods come in and the token is now accessible by the founder or the development team or the project those time periods are called token unlocks so you are wondering if a token is unlocking the supply will increase the tradable supply will increase and the price must go down but that is not always true sometimes the demand for any token is very is so high that all the tokens that get unlocked get bought up very very quickly this generally happens in the bull market but in a bear Market we generally see that one week or 10 days before the token unlock day price of any cryptocurrency will start going down because in Bear Market or in a normal Market a certain increase of Supply will obviously Drive the price down so this is a good indicator especially in a bear market for building a short position or selling tokens or if you want to buy token you can just wait out a little bit and buy them at a cheaper price so how do you know when the token will get unlocked so there are various ways to do this first let's talk about the hardware you can pick your own coin that you want to track you can check their token unlock schedule on their website or on their white paper you can also follow them on Twitter and stay updated with the token unlocks and the easy way is to use some crypto tracking websites like cryptocall and token unlock let's look at the screen and see how we can do this so we will be demonstrating the use of token unlocks.app so this is a website that tracks the upcoming token unlocks you can also create a watch list in which you can track the tokens that you hold and see when the unlock is coming so currently if you see we have an ape unlock coming in and it will happen in around 10 days so we did make a trade on this and we are we can see that price of a coin going down then we also have Dy DX that unlock is in 11 days it also shows what percent of tokens are unlocked if a high percent of tokens are locked that means the supply is very low in the market and token unlocks will definitely impact the price eyes and price may go down but if a lot of token has been unlocked there is only five ten percent of token that is locked then the unlock will not affect the prices so let's open ape and see what information it shows so it shows the next event is in 10 days it shows how much percent of that token is locked right now to 63 percent is locked so that's why a price is being affected heavily by this unlock and it also shows the wasting allocation so we have project treasury that has this many Apes airdrop used this many years and in this way you can also check the wasting schedule of any token then we also have allocation yoga Labs had 15 allocation UL app founder has eight percent and so on you can track everything about any project so this was a quick intro to what our token unlock why are certain token long how can you track these token unlocks and how can you trade on this

Hill we're talking about seven different cryptos that he thinks are making breakouts right now from a technical standpoint that are really interesting right now very interesting times to be looking at these cryptos and you know we'll be talking about cardano xrp uh some of the meme coins Bitcoin salana so stay through to the end of the video I put some pressure on him towards the end give me one that you think will outperform everything else uh within reason right so we'll be going through those also if you want to trade crypto there's a link underneath the video to btcc you can start trading there in just a few seconds and with the link underneath the video you get 10% bonus on first-time deposits and all users that use that link will get lower trading fees so definitely check that out if you want to leverage trade I've been doing this and you can make a ton of money from it of course make sure that you understand the risks and all that but check it out underneath the video now let's get over to Tyler I'll have his link underneath as well Tyler thanks so much for coming back on the channel as I said your links are going to be underneath the video what are you seeing in the market right now man things are getting insane I mean obviously you know we have Bitcoin pushing up to 100K right now um is it going to hit it honestly don't know I've always said that when we get to 100K it's just gonna be it might be on edge for a while just because everyone's expecting it to get there and because they're expecting it to get there it very well might not get there just in the shorter term time frames but you know what I'm looking at personally right now is the fact that where we're at right now is kind of just extra like everybody wants it to hit 100K just because they want to see 100K but do you remember whenever I came on your channel this was about a month and a half ago and I can go find the link we were talking about the fact that we saw this thing building up and you were like so what if we're going to look at a bitcoin price prediction where do you think that we could go I was like well if things get absolutely ridiculously bullish out of nowhere I think we would do something called a 1.618 Fibonacci extension which puts us around $95,000 that was my ultra bullish guess as to where we went and you can see that's where we are now and so interestingly enough like even though Bitcoin is pushing up right now and it feels great it's already completed the ultra bullish move that we needed to see on the midterm right so even if it starts to pull back now it's not a big deal it made that move that will open up the door for it to push up towards 130 140 150k already getting up to 100K right now is just extra it's just a cherry on top we don't need it because if you look back at say 2021 for example right you can see what happened here although 2021 was a little bit more bullish right things were a little bit more uh just yeah just bullish in terms of whenever we got up to the same level you can see what happened here once we were able to surpass this 1.618 Fibonacci extension Zone we saw a big old pull we went a little higher but we saw a big old pullback and we cooled down for about a month there but then it didn't matter because bitcoin's price was able to continue up higher towards that more overextended all-time high which is what I'm looking for here and so in A Moment Like This A's not a I was talking about a in a video just now but bitcoin's already done the move it's already broke that door that's going to open up for us to get up to 130 so I don't I don't even particularly care if we don't get to 100K right now so this is ultra bullish this is like the most bullish scenario that it possibly could have been for Bitcoin in the short term so whatever happens next hey man I'm just I'm I'm kind of just chilling with it I'm all good yeah yeah awesome and obviously like bitcoin's doing really well who knows if someone just smashes the buy button just so that they can be the person to make it go over 100,000 um there's much purchasing out there but obviously Al starting to move too xrp made a massive move salana made a nice move cardano um maybe we can go through some of those you can say If you think maybe they're a good price to buy or what do you think the price action is on those sure so let's start with salana because salana is in a bit of a different situation than most cryptos because it is in price Discovery already at this point and maybe not fully right we are still kind of interacting with that previous all-time high but we have seen split moments where we've broken it and I'll dive a bit into Ada and xrp because they're making very similar moves so with salana right now for example it's just going to show that okay whenever you think about the liquidity Cycles in crypto we all know that when Bitcoin moves the most likely ones to move in tandem with Bitcoin are going to be the ones that are the closest to Bitcoin in in the like the terms of safety right so if Bitcoin goes up you can expect your ethereums to go up your salonas to go up the ones that have stuck around been around people trust the the ones everyone right and so in A Moment Like This salana quite simply is going up just because Bitcoin is you know just pushing liquidity down into the market and people are funneling that liquidity in people are starting to expect now that bitcoin's price is hit 100K that it's going to begin you know altcoin seasion to start sometime pretty soon if you look at something like Bitcoin dominance we have it here you can see that it is creating a bearish structure this is a sort of structure that will usually break to the downside so I think people are starting to try to front run this move they're expecting altcoins to start outperforming B coin soon so they're going to those next ones they're going to the ones that they think are going to perform well such as the salana now salana itself I personally don't think it's in a great Zone to buy right now and the only reason that I say that is because it's making an insane decision the decision it's making is am I going to break my all-time high or not right we can see here of course it's had that moment where it's gone above it but realistically you just you delete all this and you just look at it for what it is Salam is trying to decide right now whether or not we're going to break this zone or not and so trying to buy a crypto while at all-time high resistance is never a good idea in my opinion you could literally buy it $10 higher than it is right now and it'd be a better time than buying it right now quite simply because it has now broken down this barrier that stopped the bull market last time because people forget that this is the area that stopped sana's bull market it's not just a weak little measly point of resistance it's a major point of resistance and so for salana right now the only thing that even remotely matters is whether or not it's capable of breaking it if it doesn't we might see it come back down and start retesting these previous points of resistance possibly back as low as $200 but if we do break it hey the door is now wide open I've said $350 salana has been on the way for a while now and that might be the opportunity that we might need for it to get up there so for salana at this moment it's moving as a result of the liquidity being front run I think and as a result of that a decision is being made for salana now if we move into something like Ada and xrp the picture is a little different and the picture is a lot more exciting in my opinion um which is I never ever thought I would say that the picture for aen and xrp is more exciting than salana right now but what we can see is that they've not gotten that traction yet salana obviously front run all this thing salana was the first mem coin choice of the people right so this year salana was obviously the one smashing it but a and xrp are now coming into their own it's kind of like their moment right now and what you can see is that although things have been bullish recently and good they're really just getting started because if you look at the macro structure of both aah cardano I'll this out obviously we have this macro structure here when macro just means in the grand scheme of things really and then you look at xrp we're getting very similar pictures and these pictures are a picture of two and a half years worth of building one of the biggest bullish structures that I've ever seen in crypto before I have not seen this before I've never seen an entire bare Market form one structure to push into the bull market in my life and so because of that whenever I look at something like xrp that's broken out of that structure broken at 618 to 786 zone is aiming for that all-time high and a cardano that just today is breaking out of that structure aiming at an all-time high with a breakout Target of Target of $3 for Ada and one of about $3 and roughly 50 to3 $335 to $3.50 for xrp I'm looking at these things saying oh they might just be getting started they like sure in the short term they might pull back they might cool down we might see them have to relax indicators reset it happens we're around the holidays people are it's Black Friday coming up people are going to want to spend some money they might pull some profits but in the grand scheme of things both Ada and xrp as a result of that liquidity starting to drain into the altcoin markets have finally now started to break out of structures that could push them up another two three fourx from here over the long term so the picture is insane for those ones maybe even a little bit crazier for salana which again I quite frankly never ever thought I would hear myself say out loud so yeah so those are your bull market price predictions somewhat conservative but not like not like super sandbagged but um that's kind of your thoughts on kind of the top of the market or just like in the next couple months while we play out this so so I always lean in favor of being conservative because if I'm wrong great you know what I mean if I'm wrong and it goes further than that fantastic I think that there's a decent sized chance that we see the total market cap of altcoins hit roughly around $45 trillion dollar I think that that makes sense that would put the total market cap somewhere of crypto though 9 trillion 10 trillion if bitcoin's still in control if bitcoin's not in control a little bit lower maybe we see altcoin total market cap go to n or five trillion roughly right if that is the case and we do see a similar order of altcoins which things will change some will pop up and do better than others whatever that's going to put Adas xrps Salas 3 Xing 4 Xing four and a half Xing from here which is good people oftentimes look at salana and they think salana is going to $3,000 a cycle no it's not I like I don't mean to be the bear of news but salana is not going to be worth over a trillion dollar or2 trillion dollars just in the next couple months maybe if this is a continue thing over three four years maybe so but do I think it's going that high no and trust me I'm not a salon bear I bought this thing at 10 bucks when everybody was leaving but we just have to be realistic here a 4X in the top 10 right now is very good because the risk now for something like salana or ethereum is incredibly low like the risk of ethereum just disappearing right now very low and so as the risk goes down the reward will diminish it's just the natural way that this flows and so for me yeah I think if we're looking at the top 10 3x 4X something around there makes sense to me maybe a little bit closer to a 3X or something like salana makes sense for me yeah I think people have to understand too as the price gets higher the price risk goes up like the chance that we can get pullback but the underlying crypto is probably stronger than ever like when Bitcoin goes up to 200,000 there are more people that hold it than ever the people have more power it's more decentralized uh or there the bitcoin's in stronger hand so it's better but you could also see a pullback easier than you could at I don't know 30,000 or something like that um how about meme coins obviously meme coins are some of the best performers this year and I know you have to go so I love kind of your quick takes on some of the top performing meme coins too yeah so meme coins are giving me good signs right now I'm actually really liking what I'm seeing there and you know I haven't talked about meme coins on my own channel in a like outside of the the biggest ones in a while because you know micro caps smaller ones DJ meme coins they're not doing that good we have peanut the squirrel doing good we have chill guy coming out but those are they they pale in comparison to like whenever Pepe released last year when we saw bunk go off earlier this year or even you know some of the avac meme coins that popped off in like December of last year right they're not really doing the same things and so it does feel like we're still kind of early on the meme coin scene I don't quite think we're seeing that momentum really hit them yet and you're starting to recognize that especially if you look at the charts for example you look at something like Sheba enu shibba enu is really just starting to gain momentum we of course have seen these bullish structures it did create a da a daily inverse Head and Shoulders back here it has a breakout Target that it's not even hit yet right like it it broke out of that that inverse Head and Shoulders came back down it's building a foundation it's not even hit that point yet now the question then becomes are we building a cup and handle pattern that's an interesting thought to have because of so things could get much crazier but at the end of the day in general you look at sh sh's not really gotten there yet it's not really caught that momentum like you would expect it to yet because it's not time yet you look at something like Pepe Pepe is moving a little bit better but Pepe substantially smaller whenever we're talking about you know market caps I mean sure Pepe is getting up there but when we consider how big Pepe could get Pepe has a rather small market cap so when I look at Pepe sure it might be creating an all-time high fantastic but at the end of the day I still think this thing could go substantially higher from here if we enter into a parabolic bull run a Pepe Pepe hitting the same similar market cap range that something like Doge or Shiva enu did in 2021 isn't difficult especially something like Shiva enu I can see that happening Pepe is probably one of the most notable meme coins that there is now with one of the strongest and most Psychopathic communities and I am in that community so I'm also a psychopath don't get me wrong and so with that in mind I look at Pepe Pepe is just getting started you look at something like Bon yes sure Bonk might be putting in an all-time high right now and you know yeah it's doing a good job of it it's broke above these previous highs trying to build a foundation as we speak but this is just the beginning I feel like we're just putting some of the earlier layers on the cake right now because if you truly know how mein's opera this isn't what a top of a mcoin cycle looks like it doesn't look like this it it surely doesn't look like that and it really for sure does by no means look like this and so for me with mean coins still feels very early I still feel like liquidity is kind of going their way because retail is getting excited but when we see liquidity really hit mean coins people will know you you'll just kind of no like oh snap this is the top of the cycle so for meme coins man they're all starting to break out they're all starting to make some decent moves to the upside and maybe even set some all-time Highs but from a grand scheme of things these ones I mean we're still talking Pro possible 10 x's on some of them and that's crazy because some of them are already in the billions so I think we're still rather early into this portion of the cycle last question gonna kind of put you on the spot here obviously like a rising tide lift all boats so everything's looking bullish bitcoin's looking bullish what do you see outperforming the rest of the market so maybe you know everything is going to 3x but this might go 8X or 10x or something like that and I know this is you not Financial advice and stuff like that but obviously like Bitcoin dominance has moved up a lot over the last two years is there something that can do that so something or like a specific crypto or a specific Niche what are we thinking either or I would say I would say if I was going to go somewhere in the middle if I was going to aim somewhere in the middle I would personally say that your more legendary status meme coins are probably going to outperform the majority of everything in the best way of risk versus reward so obviously salana might 2x or 3x cool not to say no one cares but no one cares Bitcoin might 2x or 3x no one cares this is crypto we're all degenerates we all want more than that right but if you want 100x you're going to be playing with fire you're going to get rug pulled over and over and over again it's just what's it has to happen of course there are private sales but Private Sales are a little bit hard to get into maybe you know if you're a KO it's easy but if you're not it's kind of difficult right and so those can be a little bit off boundary so I don't want to go that far but also I don't want to go down to like New Meme coins because quite frankly the mem coins that are going to perform the best haven't even launched yet they're not even here yet there's going to be the one that comes out and then sends it to 5 billion for no reason at all it's not come out yet so knowing that it's not come out yet if I had to go a step higher I'll go to Your Meme coins and I'm talking your bretts I'm talking your Pepe your bon your whs those ones I think those ones that are legendary from like 2022 2023 but they've not seen a real bull market yet look for those to do the best because obviously does Sheba cool I think they'll do great but they're big they're already big but when I look at something like a Brett that has so much of a community and momentum behind it but has not seen a real bull market yet I think that's where if you want some good gain still a 10x 15x possible 20x with less risk that's where I would be aiming for so let's go with that let's go with that for a change yeah I think that makes sense and obviously like we're investing in meme coins and so Approach at your own risk but Brett right now is a$ 1.5 billion market cap I think Sheba hit 40 billion last cycle so if it hits something similar you're looking at a 25x or something like that dogecoins at a 58 billion dollar market cap right now so yeah when you just compare it it's not even close Tyler thanks so much for coming on I'll leave a link to your channel underneath the video uh yeah we'll have to do this again because the price action is super interesting recently sure no absolutely and again hey you know I I've said it every time I've come on this channel and one thing that I always say when I like to go is just keep sticking to your strategies everyone it's it's gonna right now things are kind of chill they actually feel good to me like the moment everything kind of cooled down a little bit calmed down it's like yeah bitcoin's creeping up to 99 but it's not moving 10K in a day I like moments like this and so in A Moment Like This take advantage of it go back look at what happened last week did you freak out did you buy and sell for no reason did you start making crazy moves figure out the mistakes that were made last week to make sure that when that crazy time comes again which it will come again you're a little bit better prepared so keep developing keep reving the strategies sticking to them and we'll be here to you know do our best to keep guiding everybody as much as possible yeah definitely you don't want to be the person that keeps on shifting to the flashiest crypto and then end up not making anything when you're in the entire full Market Tyler thanks so much see you in the next one see everybody",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkN4wrb-P9w,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Cardano', 'Pepe', 'Bonk',

Grass Price, Grass Price Prediction, Grass longterm, Grass Tokenomics,  #grass #cryptoai #crypto","the grass token on Solana has more than doubled in the last week it's a New Concept it's trying to monetize unutilized internet bandwidth will the token continue to appreciate I've already made a video on grass before let's look deeper into the onchain analytics so we are currently at $36 we are up 123% this week and we have to take the on analytics a bit with a grain of salt because a lot of trading actually does not happen on chain on Solana a lot of trading happens on the centralized exchanges so chances are that you heard about grass on your centralized exchange app it appears as if the exchanges have some interest in moving the token but I've already explained this in more detail in the prior video at the time by the way we were still at $273 and so after publishing we first went up by 40% almost to then retrace again now I tried to be early on this channel I publish videos on various meme coins regularly over here so feel free to subscribe now here's something very interesting grass actually did see a lot of attention by retail now that attention seems to have slowed down check out the performance of that video it's published only 3 days ago and an average video is here in gray that grass video got roughly five times more views but check out how this is now slowing down maybe the centralized exchanges advertise the grass token a bit less on their platforms now but let's see what we can get from the onchain analytics what we've got behind behind me is the number of new users per day so this is simply tracking on the Solana chain whenever a new wallet buys into the grass token and we can ignore the very latest data point because today is not yet over but we can see an interesting Spike on the 8th of November that's also when the price spiked it appears as if the initial launch brought a lot of ATT tension but then the secondary wave must have been marketing now this chart looks especially impressive when we compare this to the number of recurring Traders per day almost every single day we see more new time Traders than recurring Traders this is good because that shows us an expanding investor base right the more people invest into a token the better and the effect with those two waves that we can see from the new versus recurring Traders we can also see that in the number of token transactions initially a wave upon launch than a secondary rally again more token transactions of course means more attention 10 to mean also higher prices now who's driving the current prices at least when we just look on chain is it the small retail wallets is it the medium siiz retail wallets is it large retail is it the Wales this by the way is Holdings up to $1,000 up to $10,000 up to $100,000 and above $100,000 and we see how this spiked when we combine all wallet cohorts on the 8th of November but we also noticed how that spike is less pronounced for medium retail so it's really the smaller wallets that tend to make more trans actions now where the growth is the strongest now there was an airdrop of grass and this is how the number of holders spiked so much at the beginning that airdrop sell pressure of course is not good for the price action but it seems like the centralized exchanges or some whales supported the price during the selling it seems now that the selling is somewhat stopping because on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 300 grass tokens at the current price that's roughly $900 worth of the token for the graph in the middle we've got a minimum holding of $9,000 for the graph on the right a minum holding of $90,000 so it's small retail mediumsized retail and the Wales and we can see how small retail aggressively sold the airdrop but just recently right when we look at the last 24 hours the selling seems to subed somewhat we even see some accumulation of medium-sized retail in the last week that might partially explain this rally and at the same time the whales aren't selling at all now we go a 10x with each of those charts in minimum holding so when this here is going up by roughly 50 wallets that offsets selling of 500 wallets over here and it appears as if that's exactly what's happening right the selling wasn't as aggressive by small retail compared to the buying of medium retail now I do have a problem with the token with the onchain analytics of the token and that's why I don't own any grass and that's the massive massive ownership by the Wales so this is something we normally do not see 19 8.8% is held by wallets that have at least $100,000 worth of the token in the wallet the wallets that have less than $1,000 off the token they currently only own 0.7% and it still tends to decline but potentially also somewhat slowing down the share of medium-sized retail and large retail tends to slightly grow in the last week but really what seems to be happening is that small retail tends to sell the airdrop and the whales buy up that selling press I believe the future of this token is 100% in the hands of the centralized exchanges of the team of the developers of all the Insiders where we don't know what the actual plan is I don't think that the plan is to rock pull everybody within the next week but I also don't think that the plan is that this token will outperform Bitcoin over the next 10 years what I think is most likely going to happen is that the token will get continued support by the Wales to generate attention with the price action and then after a while potentially bleed the people that hold the token so it's probably not a quick pump and dump it's probably some kind of slow accumulation this is my best guess to then afterwards maybe when Bitcoin Ries to sell off some of that altcoin to make it not as visible because if grass was to go up by 10% while Bitcoin ethereum was to go up Say by 20% then there won't be too many people they're going to complain now obviously there are a lot of eyeballs on grass this is what I can see directly here on YouTube however when I observe the wallet tracking here in premium in the premium membership of this channel where we cheack more than 400 influencer wallets I don't see that much action so again this is a hint that this is driven just by a few insiders that push a lot of marketing and that marketing seems to be not through the influencers so over here we've got the grass token we've only seen how elme Al Lim an influencer with roughly 300,000 followers how he swapped out of the grass token how he sold grass for $160 he also sold the airdrop we don't see any other signal around this token and this is somewhat surprising at least if this attention was natural right if this was something that goes across all of crypto and so I personally I prefer to buy tokens that actually get long-term adoption where I see a lot of small investors buying in where I then also see support by the whales I don't necessarily like tokens that get sold off through an airdrop and then just get supported by few insiders I think it's better to see what the top Traders are doing to see what influencers are doing when influencers buy a token and then afterwards promoted on their Channel prices tend to go up and that's why there is a dedicated tutorial course just on finding and tracking those influencers it's eight videos in total again it's part of Premium it's down below the bitcoin.com and there's not just those eight videos there is more than 100 videos also on blockchain Analytics the data we looked at today also on portfolio allocation on risk management Etc so once we know that an influencer buys a token we of course also discuss this in dedicated chats within Telegram and if you're an active crypto Trader and you haven't yet found the community that brings your Alpha feel free to check it out it's $125 per month there is a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like it just message me within the first 7 days and I refund you 100% if it's the first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video all see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5D6sE3M-pQ,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'Grass',

finally taking off and Ono Finance is leading the pack in terms of performance let's have a look at who's currently buying who's selling let's look at onchain data to try to figure out whether or not it still makes sense to buy Ono now this is not the first video on Ono on this channel I first published a video 318 days ago and that video outperformed the average video so obviously there is some retail interest a few more videos followed as well again all of those videos outperformed and so yeah I tried to be early on this channel right that first video was published when the price was still at 28 cents now we are at $167 and so yeah feel free to subscribe I try to publish assets that still have upside potential that still can do the multiple X returns is Ono still in a situation where it can still do another five or another 10 x let's have a look now the first positive news is that this is not just a random pump and dump we do see how the protocol gets more more assets as in the total value locked is nicely increasing over time we're currently at 641 million locked up in Ono at the same time we see the price recently spiking a lot and that seems to be mainly because of larger buyers not necessarily because there are a lot of small buyers the number of buyers today is actually smaller than the number of sellers it's simply just that the buyers move more Capital per transaction now let's get into the weats let's have a look at the onchain holders there are 73,000 hold holders in total but not all of those holders are created equal right some of them has just a few cents of the token others might have hundreds of thousand of dollars worth of the token let's dive deeper what we see over here are charts that I like to look at for pretty much any altcoin that's analyzed on this channel and that's the number of retail investors over time and the number of whale investors over time and the way we make this differentiation is with minimum holding thresholds so it's 500 tokens on the left 5,000 tokens in the middle and 50,00 tokens on the right now 500 tokens means roughly $11,000 worth of the token a bit less than that so that is small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail so that's now a bit under $10,000 and on the right is the Wales so that's a Min holding of $100,000 worth of the token there's a very nice constant increase of retail interest the purchasing has somewhat slowed down since summer of this year for medium-sized retail and for the whales we even see a bit of profit taking or the number of whales at least shrinking slightly since the summer of this year and so that is what caused this crash in the meantime we went down by more than 60% we also see how a tension comes in waves so this is now the number of buyers and sellers over time on the left on the right it's normalized to 100% it seems like most days there are more buyers than sellers not necessarily today right today we mainly see the large weights buying in but on average maybe there is 55% buyers versus 45% of sellers recently that's what causes the rally but let's zoom in a little bit let's have a look at what happened in the last month specifically so this is where the price almost 3x so it went up by 172% during that time the number of retail investors Grew From 34,800 to 36,700 so it's roughly a growth of 6 to 7% in a month for mediumsized holders We Grew From 9,70 to 9,290 Holders so that's less growth that's only 2 and A2 % growth roughly on the right we've got the Wales and even though in the grand scheme of things they tend to be selling in the last month they did not in the last month they increased from 986 to 1,26 so growth of roughly 4% so retail grew the fastest then came the Wales the middle is somewhat lacking behind now for a price in general to go up it's never that bad to also see that the investor base Grows Right the more people we see buying into a token the higher a price can established now on the left side we see the number of new wallets per day that trade the token and again we're just looking at the last month and we see how this is growing over time so this again supports the rally on the right side we see the number of new users versus returning users over time normalized to 100% this seems to be somewhat balanced now how much more upside potential is there within the rwa narrative So within real world assets Ono is already one of the largest players it's got 2. .3 billion in market cap only beaten by Mantra with 3.2 billion what that means is that buying Ono is not just a purchase in Hope of increased adoption but it's also a purchase in the hope of the rwa narrative in general picking up more steam now in the last 7 Days real world assets was one of the top performing crypto narratives I believe there might be some more upside especially given that regulation becomes no more favorable players like Black Rock one to tokenize more assets they want to bring things like the S&P 500 Index on chain to make it easier accessible for people outside of the US and so at some point far out in the future we might see how those two worlds merge right how crypto and traditional Finance merges and then of course the players that are directly in the middle of that merch can profit the most now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stablecoin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stable coin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collapse so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us deped the market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FTX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stablecoin market kept going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly heated what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to Peak at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential floor here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the alt coins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of a i agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can we buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet tracking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bit booy crypto sold virtual tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2,500 who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky plays regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these buy and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle chesse that bought $100,000 worth of the token and that was at 48 and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin tray.com it's not just wallet tracking thing that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dedicated chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first seven days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to still buy Ono I believe yes I believe there is a lot of adoption long-term by retail but also by the Wales but of course we are in general currently riding the positive crypto wave right Ono can go down we have seen crashes of more than 60% but that usually happens during a bare Market currently the market is expanding more and more money is flowing into crypto the stablecoin market cap is going up thus I also believe that Ono measured in US dollars at least is likely going to increase as well if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Cas9VAg8Q,"['Bitcoin', 'MANTRA', 'Ondo', 'JUST', 'Terra', 'Waves',

I'll also link to that Below in the description but getting back to suie as a project uh during its first year the chain had a pretty quiet period but during the last couple of months uh as we've seen SOI has exploded especially during September of this year so last month the marketing team went so far as to rename the entire month suie Timber and in this case it was justified there's a good reason for them doing that one of the major reasons and what got us especially excited was the pre-order list for the sui play 0x1 this is the first web 3 native handheld gaming device and just the pre-orders alone actually set all kinds of records with regards to this categorization of electronic it did really really well and then back in May sui launched Misty seti this is an upgrade to their consensus mechanism it made it the fastest chain around and that means it can now confirm transactions within 390 milliseconds in other words almost instantaneously and looking ahead although not that far ahead just a few months to q1 2025 sui is going to launch walrus this is a decentralized storage platform kind of like filecoin and it's going to have its own native wall token that's w like I said uh there's a lot of news that's just kind of scratching the surface really of the news that we can highlight here but for the purposes of just defining the project giving you a bird eye perspective of SOI that's what it's been up to that's what the team has been doing there's a lot of other stuff in terms of previous coverage that we've discussed uh in the past you can check that out if you want but I think that uh we've kind of defined the project what they're doing what they're all about let's move on now to some technical analysis some ta for the soie token and we have to consider the fact that its current all-time low was 36.4 that occurred on the 19th of October last year uh just about exactly a year ago the most recent support was at 53 cents in August of this year August 2024 but it doesn't look at the moment like Su is going to drop to 53 cents anytime soon uh there could always be a Black Swan event in crypto so I'll Never Say Never but the fact is if you bought SOI below a dollar uh you did well you're pretty much uh you've doubled your money by now possibly better now we're down slightly on the day just off of all-time highs recently at $1.99 right now that's down nearly 5% on the day the current resistance really sits right now at $2.35 that's the recent all-time high that we saw once so we can break through this uh there's realistically no stopping it uh anytime soon we're going to be in Uncharted Territory there may be some smaller corrections but the general tendency here especially given where we are right now as we enter the bare Market the general tendency is going to be upwards and suie sits right now at a 5.48 nearly 5.5 billion dollar market cap so all-time highs and market caps uh that stuff is all well and good let's consider Su to economics though for a moment because if we consider the performance of the token uh it went from $1.33 uh at launch down to 36 Cents like I mentioned October last year that's not great uh but the comeback has been pretty impressive in February February and March of this year it had two consecutive at that time all-time highs of .91 and $27 looking at the last year of performance here the suie token is up about 300% uh and like I mentioned the last month especially as we came out of September has been very good I'm going to zoom out a little bit further here so that we can consider the last uh six weeks or so kind of beginning of September to where we are now on the 17th of October you can see here that we went up by an impressive 130 135 maybe 140% or so like I said the current price is a199 with now a $5.5 billion market cap so it's been a pretty extraordinary run here over these last five six weeks or so during a time when the rest of the market has not been that confident certainly the only thing we're not crazy about is as you can see here we have a total and Max supply of 10 billion tokens but only 2.76 billion are currently in circulation meaning only 27.6% are in circulation it's a younger project uh so that's kind of excusable I suppose uh but there are certainly young projects with better circulating supplies that's the only negative here when evaluating the tokenomics that I think is worth mentioning it's not a deal breaker uh it's just kind of underwhelming as a metric 27.6% circulation but having said that earlier this month there was a big token unlock of $110 million but still with sui's recent momentum uh it didn't really make much of an impact whereas token unlocks usually do that wasn't quite the case for sui uh which is nice to see it continued on its climb and the price went even higher it actually achieved new all-time highs following that token unlock which is very impressive so just keep that in mind again that circulating Supply uh future token unlocks because their vesting schedule only ends in April of 2030 so we still have a few years to go on a different note however suie a token has outperformed BTC by over 220% since early August and if you take that uh in consideration with the tvl explosion I mean we're talking about a very impressive project here and uh very impressive performance by sui as a token at least at the moment right now certainly that's undeniable and I haven't even mentioned this yet but also we have native usdc that's coming to sui at any moment when this is officially announced it's going to pump the defi sector even more and we can probably expect further upwards price action in response to this very good news and don't forget that you can also stake your SOI straight in your sooi wallet staking periods start and end with each epic a sui epic lasts about 24 hours so they're pretty accessible and pretty frequent this is just a period during which selected validators process transactions so in other words there's certainly no long unstaking period and so if this Market pulls back hard under this level and then consolidates and comes back we're likely to sell and [Music] stall so how many SOI do we need to purchase today to own today in order to be a SOI crypto millionaire at the height of its value in this crypto Bull Run okay well I already mentioned all the reasons that we very much like SOI um certainly it's tvl the Misty CTI update walrus which is upcoming in q1 of 2025 the native usdc is coming again that's a really big deal and that aggressively increasing number of daily active users that's huge it reflects the popularity of the ecosystem and that metric is up about 300 % as of late everything is growing when it comes to SOI lately um however the SOI token did dip about 15% on the 4th of October that's okay like I said it has since made new all-time highs and has gone up to $2.35 so not a big deal uh that was just a bit of a correction on the way up and also remember that in September SOI went up by over 120% a correction was overdue uh it's a little bit volatile when the appreciation of any tokens prices is this steep but that's okay certainly dips like this are entirely predictable and uh can be anticipated pretty easily like I said every soie that you may have gotten under $2 was a pretty great deal in my book so for the sake of an easy calculation here let's lock in the price of SOI at $2 just about a penny or so higher than what we're currently seeing reflected on screen but we'll consider a $2 soie like I said we want to be millionaires at the height of the next bull market cycle based on the value of SOI so we're kind of beginning with our goal in mind a million dollars I think at a $5.5 billion market cap and given everything that's going right for this project that sui is doing well I think it's safe to assume that we could eventually see a 10x increase in the price of SOI I.E not a $2 token price but a $20 token price let's be optimistic and assume that so if we were to get a $20 per token soie price let's take that million dollar that we started with and divide it by the unit cost of $20 and as you can see here pretty simple math if we have a million doll worth of soie at $20 that means we're holding 50,000 soie tokens okay but that's a future price right that's at a $20 soie token price if you were to buy those 50,000 tokens today at $2 a piece you'd be investing $100,000 into that investment right $100,000 would buy you $50,000 sui tokens I think a 10x is pretty reasonable but let's both do the conservative and the optimistic uh contingency case here so let's say we don't do a 10x let's be a little bit more conservative let's talk about a 5x here uh whether it's in this bull cycle or a little bit further down the road a 5x for soie that means we'd be going from a $2 token price to a $10 token Price Right $2 * 5 = 10 so let's take our million dollars again that's the end point that we want to achieve let's divide that by $10 SOI token price pretty simple math here that's 100,000 SOI tokens that's what you'd require to have a million dollars worth of sui if each one of them is worth $10 and if you need to acquire 100,000 SOI tokens at current prices again we said uh $2 we're rounding up so $100,000 time $2 is $200,000 you would need to invest $200,000 into soie today to own $100,000 tokens To Be A Millionaire assuming a five times SOI token multiplication that's a little bit more conservative like I said let's consider a super optimistic case uh let's take $2 where we currently are multiply that by 20 this is really a best case scenario so this would generate a $40 sui token price if we go back to our million dollars uh and we divide that by 40 the SOI token price Well we'd need 25,000 SOI to be a crypto millionaire at the height of the next Bull cycle if the SOI token uh is one day worth $40 25,000 SOI tokens times $40 per token would give us a million dollar if we were to acquire the 25,000 tokens today at a $2 price this is the most optimistic case that would represent a $50,000 investment any one of these scenarios could be a possibility uh I think a 20x maybe beyond the scope of this bull cycle but like I said salana did a 74xl in the space if there's a project that uh we fully support and endorse as far far as the team uh doing everything fundamentally right it is SOI so I think uh a 40x if it's not exactly in this you know upcoming cycle that is possible one day certainly a 5x I think is on the more

Brad Garlinghouse: RIPPLE BULL RUN CONFIRMED! XRP PRICE PREDICTION,"Ripple (XRP) Price Breaks Above the Multi-Year Consolidation: Here is What it Means for the Crypto Space  The XRP price has maintained a steep ascending trend ever since the token rebounded from the March 2020 lows. The price further went up by more than 1000% and also encountered a drastic bear market, losing over 80% of its gains. Regardless of the bullish or bearish trend prevailing within the market, the XRP price held the lower ascending trend line, which has been acting as a strong support since then. Now that the price has soared beyond its bearish reach, the token is believed to mark a dollar milestone anytime from now.  The XRP price jumps by over 20% in just a few hours, aiming to reach levels above $0.8, which may occur anytime from now. With this, the optimism around XRP has surged as the token lands up as one of the top performers compared to the last several days, largely driven by memecoins. After remaining behind the crypto market trends for a long time, the XRP price has finally triggered a bullish trend.  #ripple #xrp #sec",Transcript not available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLRRGJv4U5E,['XRP'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xLRRGJv4U5E/hqdefault_live.jpg,2024-12-06T02:14:24Z

NFT basically creates a blockchain-based digital certificate for your digital collectables, including games, music, art, and many more. This certificate gives your artwork a unique identity. The Underlying technology and the programming language used by NFTs are the same as other cryptocurrencies ie. Blockchain and the programming language Ethash or Scrypt. On the other hand, NFT is a unique token; therefore, if you try to trade it, you may end up with something completely different in your hands. Cryptopunks is a remarkable example of NFT, it enables you to buy, sell and store 10,000 collectables with the proof-of-ownership being stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.  NFT has proved itself to be a boon in the lives of many others  - like Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter with his very first and famous tweet, just setting up my twitter,and Vignesh Sundaresan, famously known as Metakovan,who bought 69.3 million dollars worth of NFT art on Beeple. Owing to its increasing popularity, people are now willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for NFTs.  ‚û°Ô∏è About Post Graduate Program In Full Stack Web Development This program will give you the foundation for building full-stack web apps using the Java programming language.

fundamentals let's have a look at the data that most people are not looking at this is the r I'm referring to we are currently at 0.9 cents roughly and I'm not going to bore you with the marketing jazz on the website we probably not going to find out why the price is going up just based on that instead let's start off with the GitHub repository the place where programmers submit their code changes so you can see how much activity is there currently around noos and what we're seeing is an update 3 days ago another one 5 days ago last week another one last week so there seems to be activity this is not a dead project whatsoever it's a very technical project the documentation is also housed on GitHub and nervos has a strong support by the mining Community you can mine nervos tokens Asic miners now when you go to coin market cap you might consider checking out the chain Explorer that's this button over here but what's important is that this chain Explorer is actually not up to date the last block that's being shown here is 2 years old for whatever reason we still see an update on the UI but the age here is 2 years ago you click on a single block and you see this had been mind in 2021 instead you want to go to the main page noose. org and click on the Explorer over here that's where we get the real latest transactions with quite a bit of activity right 35 transactions in a single block and there are many blocks being mined regularly there's also a statistics page unfortunately not a lot about active wallets the hash rate is going up so more and more people are mining this and so the difficulty is going up as well in other words adoption by miners is faster than the token issuance that's in general very good but besides that we don't really know how much the chain is actually being used we've got the unique addresses used but that's growing pretty much linearly we've got the number of depositors and the am amount deposited that's not really growing for 4 years already unfortunately we've got the total Supply that's growing I've got more things to say about this in a second and here we've got the inflation rate which interestingly enough does not match the numbers that I see on chain nervos wasn't always in a rally we had our massive bull markets and subsequent crashs you want to be in altcoins when there is an altcoin rally which currently I think there is there's a lot of money flowing into crypto but have a look at the following this is the historical price chart this is the historical market cap chart we are not yet at all-time high market caps but we are way higher here in the market cap relatively speaking to the prior price action and when just looking at the price where the recent rally is just a bit of a blip that's an expression of token inflation that's an expression of more more tokens being circulating so you need to have demand growing at least as quickly as Supply and as a result of that inflation we get the chart behind me this is ckb so the noos token divided by ethereum relative performance and this did not look too pretty initially top to bottom we've seen a destruction of minus 94% from the beginning of this chart in January 2021 to today the underperformance was only 19% or so but still this shows us how important token inflation is now token inflation comes from many sources one of those sources is of course the mining another source might be token unlocks by early Beckers because noos did have Beckers check this out 28 million raised in a series a by poly chain Capital another 70 million raised through an Ico and then we got dragonfly Capital with an undisclosed amount that's been raised and so here's an article around the issurance we've got the base issurance it's currently somewhere around 20 billion but we've also got other issuance and that's now between 40 and 50 billion here's the token distribution 14% % private sale 21% public sale quite a bit of tokens also for the ecosystem and for strategic partners and for the team so this is not an entirely fairly launched cryptocurrency kaspa for instance was fairly launched this here is not have a look at the circulating Supply according to misari doio it's currently at 43 billion so that's closer to this chart than to this one and the expansion in the last year was according to that website 30% the mining inflation might be less but the total inflation at least according to misari doio is 30% that's quite High you need quite a bit of demand in order to offset that inflation inflation would be fine as long as attention stays high but I don't see that the number of telegram users is rather shrinking and so what's causing the hype it's probably two things it's an announcement that nervos is trying to become a scaling Solution on bitcoin so it's planning to integrate with the Bitcoin lightning Network and riding basically the Bitcoin scalability wave the second news is the upcoming Haring right and the idea is always when there's a Haring when there's a supply shock that potentially the price could go up at least psychologically still I don't really buy that Supply story right Supply is growing still quite fast and so again what is causing that rally why do we see the price go up by more than 160% in a month and we don't really see the fundamentals align that well can the news like the integration with Bitcoin lightning push up the price that much I'm not sure I think there's something else going on because have a look at the following numbers I do not like those numbers in the last 24 hours almost 1.5 billion worth of the token was traded on the Perpetual Market on binance that's with a market cap of only 376 million so on the Perpetual Futures Market on the derivatives Market more than four times the value of the entire market cap has changed hands on binance alone and there I say it I believe that's Market manipulation I think that binance is having their strong hands in that price Val I don't see strong growth just from the Explorer page I don't see strong growth in the socials I do see a lot of growth in the supply but that's not great for the price the only thing that I can see that's pushing this up is binance with its Perpetual Futures so I don't dare to predict where this price is going I cannot look into the heads of binance it might go further up if the price generates enough attention if it doesn't it might simply just come back down again if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you do consider to trade this R then make sure not to set any stop losses because I do expect more manipulation I do expect both wigs to the upside as

going up or what else might trigger this R let's have a look at the onchain data let's try to go beyond the price action and let's see whether or not it still makes sense at the current prices to buy the elgo token right now so this is where we are currently at 50 cents per algo the price went up by 177% today 70 3% this week and more than 300% this month can this really continue now it's always important to look at this in the grand scheme of things to zoom out right there is a saying when in doubt zoom out let's do that for algo as well let's look at algo relative to bitcoin because that's the idea with all crypto Investments right we buy an altcoin in order to get outperformance over Bitcoin a lot of cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with another so when Bitcoin goes up the altcoins tend to go up as well and vice versa in other words if we buy an altcoin we really want to get that additional risk compensated now most of the time unfortunately that did not play out that well for algo so what we've got over here is algo relative to bitcoin and since launch in June of 2019 we have seen an underperformance of 98.4% even after this recent rally now the rally from bottom to the current price is more than 200% but again this is a bit of a blip in an overall marathon of suffering but can we now maybe turn around is this maybe the final Bottom now here's one reason why we might be bottoming out probably a large contributor to the underperformance was the toomics of algo in other words the liquid supply of the algorand token tended to increase very constantly and when the Supply goes up over time while the demand doesn't grow to the same degree of course we do see underperformance but since July of this year we don't see any expanding Supply anymore so this is a good condition for some potential outperformance now maybe you know Gary gansler Gary gansler used to be the chairman of the SEC of the Securities and Exchange Commission and as such he sued a lot of crypto companies and maybe he turned so sour because his investment in l Grant did not pay off here have a look at how much he was endorsing the token uh syvia Mall's aland aland aland aland aland uh touring Award winner at at MIT that I work with um sovio has got a great technology that has a performance you could create Uber on top of it and so yeah subsequently the SEC suit all kinds of crypto companies also issuers of tokens including algorand by the way now let's have a look at the the actual usage of the algrant blockchain let's have a look at the number of addresses and of active addresses so the left chart is simply just cumulative which tended to grow quite linearly for quite a while this seems to be not very natural and now since September of this year there seems to be something going on now on the right side interesting enough you only have a 3mon maximum time window here we see the number of active addresses and this tends to spike this doesn't really look like natural growth to me there seems to be a few programmers that might be toying around creating some Bots Etc it doesn't really look like there's real adoption there's also a mismatch in the toomics so according to metric. all. info the circulating Supply is only at 82.9% so 8.2 billion of the total 10 billion are circulating but again on toomis doai we seem to already have reached the maximum Supply so I'm not sure where this difference is coming from so let's get to the central question how much actual usage is there on the blockchain how much is elant used for trading for example this is Dex screen.com and here at the top we see the 24-hour trading volume on elgrand it's 7.9 million is this a lot is this a little let's compare on the binance smart chain we had 7.8 billion not million but billion so a, times the amount roughly on Solana we had 4.5 billion on ethereum 2 billion on the base chain 1.8 billion so airr is pretty much nothing in comparison and it's still in the billions of dollars in market cap in terms of valuation the arrant market cap is currently at 4.15 billion while at the same time the trading volume on chain per day is at 7 million and so then the big question is why do we see that R recently why isn't the price just continuing to decline why do we suddenly see this Spike here now here's the thing recently the AL coins are having a very nice run what we've got over here is the others dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the altcoins that are not in the top 10 and within a month this went up by roughly 25% a lot of money from traditional Finance is finally flowing into crypto again the stable coin market cap tends to rise it's even accelerating recently and that's happening since the beginning of October of last year what we see over here that's the teral Luna collapse this is the anchor protocol going bus this is when us deped it started the bare Market where also FTX imploded and then we saw the turn around at the beginning of October of last year and now we really see money coming in all of crypto is going up this is the bull run the issue is that especially for the people that just recently start out most people tend to buy the things that just recently went up most people simply buy the things where currently a lot of attention is but the art in crypto I believe is to buy the things before everybody looks at it because once especially the very risky tokens they are already large then we mainly see profit taking for example here this is the largest meme coins in the pump. fun ecosystem so that's the Launchpad of meme coins on Solana and just have a look at this right this is the performance in the last 7 days most of those tokens went down it's about buying tokens before they become large for example over here this is the goat token it's currently at. 70 cents and I try to be early on this channel right I a video when it was still at 24 cents and so this is what this channel is all about right it's trying to identify tokens that have positive momentum a lot of organic growth but at the same time that still have the 2 3 4 5x potential and so if you want to be early next time feel free to subscribe over here I publish videos regularly now how do I find tokens like go early why am I so confident that tokens like this can go higher the answer is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and we can never a look at what are other people doing for example over here right this is a signal today we see how influencer crypto gains bought the agent token for 0.035 that was over here afterward the price went up by 12% then of course subsequently it still went down it's still up since the purchase but that's how the game works right you want to buy tokens that currently have momentum you want to take profit very early and you want to buy the things that other influencers buy you want want to buy the things that insiders are buying you want to buy the things that other top Traders are buying now here's that influencer that crypto gain influencer he's currently got more than 130,000 subscribers he's reaching the 140k and through onchain analytics we found a lot of his wallets we've got 55 of his wallets that we are tracking where we get alerts whenever he buys or sells something and so I just had a look at his recent video this AI agent crypto will 100% make people Millions that's the strawberry token that's published just 19 hours ago when the price was at 26 Cents and we got our alert that crypto gains bought the token for 17 cents and so subsequently the price went up by 215% but surprise surprise once the video hits YouTube it's already too late we did see quite a correction subsequently so have a look at this right this is actually 17 hours ago right this is the top at 11:00 p.m. now it's 400 p.m. and this video was published 19 hours ago but that doesn't really match with the price so the video was published somewhere when the price was already here so something happened between recording of the price and Publishing of the video on YouTube and so here's potentially what happened right it's just a guess but probably cryptog gains bought the token he found it very interesting for whatever reason he then potentially talked about this in his premium Community then some of his people might find the token interesting as well right it might have have been a recommendation to buy but it simply just a mention potentially in that Community a lot of his followers buy the token and they're pushing up the price further and further and once the YouTube video hits that's then when they tend to sell that's probably why we see the recent Decline and so that just shows how much power there is in wallet tracking with wallet tracking we can be among the very early buyers we can buy directly with the influencers with the Insiders before all of those other people buy in it's really about getting an edge in crypto it's really about learning more than others it's figuring out the data that most people are too lazy to compile or they don't have the capacity to compile now I talk now a lot about the single influencer but it's actually not just crypto gains that we're looking at for example check this out this is crypto benter they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token in a video and thousands and thousands of people watch that video of course this generates attention of course this pushes up the price and so of course we also have some of their wallets we've got 33 that we are tracking I have a look at this this is Alex Becker 1.5 million subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets I really believe this is the way to make money in crypto it's not drawing random lines on charts Etc it's getting an information Edge it's working for that information Edge and so that's why I created a tutorial course just on how to find influencer wallets how to then set up alerts for those influencers and how to then also interpret the signals that we get get from the alerts it's eight videos in total and it's all part of the premium membership of this channel now I do not pump and dump on this audience right we're just trying to find information it's outside of the community now premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about back testing indicators it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification onchain analytics there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we have a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare our onchain analytics that's why we've got the dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you now does it make sense to buy the elgo token right now does it make sense to jump on this current R is there potential more upside is the valuation fair I don't think that the current really is driven by natural demand I do not think that on chain there is enough usage to justify the market cap I believe what's going on here is manipulation by the market makers a lot of centralized exchanges and market makers hold the elgo token and those parties have a lot of interest in an increased trading volume in increased volatility and when they pump up a token temporarily this generates a lot of attention and that attention turns into potential purchases by the small retail guy just have a look at who's dominating the trading volume it's binance followed then by coinbase and by gate.io and by bybit and mexc it's all those centralized exchanges that own the token we've also got the Perpetual Futures Market that fuels this rally again dominated by binance followed by bybit and okx elgrand is at the market cap of roughly 4 billion it's more expensive than arbitrum for instance arbitrum had a trading volume in the last 24 hours by 1 billion which is 15 times more than what we have seen on algorand in other words I don't think that this is an asset to buy because there's a lot of adoption and we are on a growth trajectory Etc this is simply just gambling by the market makers now the issue with that gambling is that we can't really anticipate where the price will go right they might manipulated even further up they might also crash the price it's pretty much impossible to predict this that's in the end the idea here why they do this I personally think it's better to buy into tokens where we actually see natural adoption where we do see quite nice growth and we still have some upside potential I believe for ELR both is not the case we don't have a lot of upside potential and we don't have any natural growth either if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPuzVAdg9TU,"['Bitcoin',

#departmentofgovernmentefficiency #doge #crypto","the department of government efficiency token do on ethereum is climbing from one high to the next now the question is what's actually leading all of that appreciation is this a lot of retail investors buying in creating an organic Rally or is this a whale pump and dump scheme to answer that question we have to go beyond just the price charts we have to look at onchain analytics data most people aren't looking at now it appears as if the real Dogecoin is losing quite a bit of steam because the market cap is already that large that it takes millions and millions of dollars in order to push the price higher thus what I believe is currently happening is that some of those profits now get rotated over into smaller market caps now contrary to what most people believe the altcoin market as a whole is not doing that well so what we've got here is the others dominance so this is the market cap of all of the cryptocurrencies that are not in the top 10 as the fraction of all of crypto so how important are the smaller alt coins and since beginning of the year this actually went down by 33% the market is splitting into two segments there's on the one hand the long-term investors into Bitcoin that simply regard Bitcoin as the safer of the assets as the hard money and there's the people that want to speculate on Meme coins that want to get the multiple X returns and it's that second segment that makes a lot of the gains now everything that's in the middle is rather suffering but here's what's going well the pump. fun ecosystem so that's the launch pad on Solana for mem coins and Elon Musk inspired tokens and dog themed tokens those are the crypto categories that did the best in the last seven days and they're likely going to continue to outperform now within the Elon Musk inspired coins the department of government efficiency on ethereum is the second largest but have a look at the difference in market cap if only 1 or 2% of the gains that had been made with Dogecoin rotate over to the Department of government efficiency the price could R much much further now it's very important to differentiate here there are two different tokens for the Department of government efficiency there's one token on Solana with a liquidity of 1 million and there's another token on ethereum with a liquidity of 7 million now I've already published a video on the Solana based token feel free to check it out it starts to outperform the average video there is some traction here as well that video was made 5 days ago at the time we are still at 39 and now we are at above $2 and so this channel is all about being early I tried to cover meme coins very very quickly so feel free to subscribe potentially even hit the notification Bell so that you won't be late next time now let's go back to the Doge token on ethereum it's currently at 30 cents roughly and we see way more buyers than sellers today 3,400 buyers versus only 1,900 sellers now does it still make sense to buy we will not get that answer from the website right everybody looks at the website we want to look at data most people aren't considering we want to beat the market right this in the end is a player versus player game and we need to be better than the average Market participant let's first see if the numbers align let's first see if there's any kind of obvious manipulation now we've got 39,000 followers on x.com or the Twitter platform we've got 10,000 members in Telegram and we've got 16,000 holders on the ethereum Chain so all of those numbers somewhat make sense they somewhat align there isn't a real discrepancy here that suddenly one of those numbers is 10 times larger than the other so this could be organic growth now let's let's dive deeper the growth is actually quite impressive on the left side we see the number of holders with at least 3,000 Doge tokens so at the current price that's roughly $900 worth of the token that's what I'd consider retail and this is growing very nicely very constantly in the matter of 1 month it more than doubled then we've got medium-sized retail that's now a 10x in minimum holding so that's at least $10,000 worth of the token that also continues to grow pretty steadily and then on the right we've got the mega whales so that's at least $90,000 worth of the token those whales are not selling in aggregate the number of those whales is constant what does this tell us it tells us that the Wales simply wait for this growth to continue why would you sell a token when retail adopts very very quickly now here are other interesting metrics on the left side we see the number of firsttime Traders on the ethereum chain of the token on the right side we see the relationship between firsttime Traders and returning traders normalized to 100 % per day and so today we have seen a massive influx of 2550 new wallets and we see that the ratio of new users versus returning users is at an all-time high 44% of all wallets that interacted with the token are completely new to the token and the same is true when we look at the number of buyers and sellers there's simply an overhang of buyers now we do have a lot of attention on the token right now and this is potentially dangerous right the more attention there is the higher the price is attention has to grow for the price to continue to go up but it seems like this is exactly what's happening because on the right side we see the percent of buyers versus Sellers and again today there is an all-time high there is 66% of buyers versus only 34% of Sellers and so I'm 100% transparent on this channel usually I first publish a video and then afterwards I buy this time I wanted to buy earlier because I think timing is very important I've already bought and I've also announced this already in the premium membership so be aware there are potential sellers in case we rise further to a degree there is a conflict of interest here I am talking my book in this video now it's not just Elon Musk inspired tokens that are currently going up it's also the pump. fun ecosystem as mentioned at the beginning here now within the pump fun ecosystem the peut token is now the largest in terms of market cap now the art of crypto trading is of course to try to be as early as possible before a token is large now here is a way how to do this we actually got a trading signal of peanut very very early on it was at a time when the price was still at 3 cents now it's above 90 cents in appreciation of more than 2600% here is the alert that we got in premium Crypt benter bought peanut for 3 cents and we've got 33 of his wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets and so I think this is a main way to beat crypto it's very important to follow influencers that move the market like Crypt with a million followers it's very important to follow the Insiders it's important to follow traders that historically did very good trades in the past because crypto is both a game of luck and skill the more the game is played the better because the more trads we do the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so the whales tend to have more skills the whales tend to make better calls we can simply just follow the whales and get similar results and so I believe in this strategy that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on wallet tracking how can we find other crypto wallets how can we then get notifications whenever those people buy and sell and how can we then subsequently also interpret the signals that we are getting so here's that course fear free to check it out but in premium we've got more than 100 tutorial videos not just on wallet tracking but also on portfolio diversification also on onchain analytics the thing we looked at today also on risk management on many many topics once we got the wallet signals we of course need to bounce off the ideas as well we discuss when to buy when to sell we discuss the on analytics in dedicated altcoin chats in premium so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a 1e money back guarantee so in case you don't make money in case you don't like premium simply just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% there's really no risk for you so I'm very bullish on the department of government efficiency token I've personally bought some if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this video a like it helps the channel grow looking forward to seeing you in the next video or potentially even in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUcQP7ShPn8,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'JUST',

Sigma Price, Sigma Price Prediction, Sigma longterm, Sigma Tokenomics,  #sigma #memecoin #crypto","the sigma meme coin on Solana is on a massive run it's up almost 30% today it more than doubled this week let's have a look at what's behind this rally who's buying here who's selling here does it still make sense to buy Sigma how solid is this rally so we currently at roughly 14 C we are up 29% today 101% this week almost 400% this month and almost 700% this year now Sigma is one of the largest trending tokens on the Solana chain when we order the trending tokens by the liquidity pool size Sigma is at number 10 we've discussed all of the other tokens that are visible on screen already on this channel and so let's have a look at what's going on what's driving this current rally is this another pump and dump and have we suddenly simply pumped to then subsequently dump again we have seen 85% Corrections in the past let's have a look at the onchain metrics but before we do this let's first have a look at potential obvious signs for manipulation let's compare the different social metrics so on chain we've got 17,000 holders on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 11,000 followers and in the telegram are 9,500 followers with roughly 10% being currently online so the numbers all somewhat make sense and we're not going to get any outperformance versus other players in the market simply just by looking at the website we want to see who's actually driving different price movements now the nice thing about Sigma is that there isn't any any trading off chain all the trading still happens directly on Solana and more than 80% of that trading happens directly on radium so there's no need to go to your binance or to your htx account you can only buy this by using directly a phantom wallet with radium so let's go back to those holders to those 177,000 holders not all holders are created equal some might only own a few cents of the token others might own millions of the token so let's split this up what we've got over here is the number of retail in investors versus whale investors on the left side we see the number of wallets with at least 7,000 Sigma tokens at the current price that's roughly worth $11,000 in the middle we've got the number of wallets with 70,000 tokens so that's worth $110,000 the right side we got another 10x that's now currently worth $100,000 we can see how small retail tends to just buy and hold and hope for the best this is very common for retail investors we see how the somewhat larger investors tend to sell a bit more actively and we can see how the whales they tend to buy very very early on and simply then afterwards distribute now for any meme coin to rise longterm we need to see a growing investor base right we need to see more and more new people coming into the token now let's have a look at how many new wallets actually bought the token based on different days so on the left side we've got the number of new Traders versus recurring Traders for any given day on the right side we've got the number of token transactions per day and we can see how this peaked on the 9th of October for the number of new Traders we can then see how on the next day on the 10th of October that peaked for the number of token transactions and so have a look at this while all those new people came into the token the price appreciated within just 5 days we went up by 600% almost and then once the trading action CED down the price tended to rather deflate and so we see very nicely how the adoption of Sigma happened into two waves we can also see this in the trading volume we see an initial wave of trading volume then rather calm trading action and then another Resurgence now this is split up by wallet cohorts again small retail being wallets with less than $1,000 worth of the token medium up to 10,000 large up to 100,000 Wales above 100,000 and we can see how large retail and the Wales had way more trading activity in the second wave for small retail that's not as obvious and so when we look now at the trading volume not measured in US dollars but we normalize this to 100% on any given day then we see how small retail tends to have less and less of a share of trading volume and so how much value is held by those different cohorts less and less is held by small retail even when we at mediumsized retail we see a very clear deduction of the Holdings it's really the Wales that are accumulating more and more and we see this on the right as well so when we don't normalize this to 100% but just look at the US dollar values the whales now hold almost $70 million worth of the token and again we can see how the smaller wallet cohorts tend to not sell in egate that much right small retail simply just buys and holds even for medium-sized retail that's somewhat true it's really the smart money that times the market that does find exit opportunities every now and then and the Wales did exit quite a bit on the 12th of October again that is when the price decline started and so it's all about timing in crypto right it's all about following the smart money the Wales tend to make the better calls than small retail because the Wales have played the game for a while that's why they've got so much money crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes and so besides onch analytics here's my Approach how to time the market and how to be as early as possible I like to track wallets of people that made profit in the past but also of influencers that tend to move markets for example we can see over here how AI Lim and Kyle chesse bought Sigma at around 7 cents now we are more than double that price here's Ari Lim's YouTube channel he's got 70,000 subscribers here is Kyle chess he's got 133,000 and from Kyle chesse alone we've got 12 wallets that we actively track of course not all of those wallets are known by the masses we also have 33 wallets by Crypt benter Krypto benter has more than a million subscribers on YouTube so does Alex Becker by the way we've got 12 of his wallets and so that's the idea right we want to follow the smart money we want to follow the money that moves the prices once we've got the signals from those track wallets we of course also discuss those signals in dedicated chat groups in premium so I think this topic is so important that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on that it's eight videos in length it's about how to find different influencer wallets how to then track them and how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking besides those eight videos there's more than a 100 other videos that's all about risk management about onchain analytics Etc feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% it looks like the Wales know what they're doing with Sigma it seems like they're speculating on adoption by the centralized exchanges now if you got some value a this video If you to subscribe I proba you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

Tokenomics,  #hbar #hedera #crypto","what is going on with hedera hash graph why is the H bar token rallying that much who's buying here who's selling here what are the news let's have a look at some data most people are not considering to try to figure out whether or not it still makes sense to buy H bar now we're currently at 35 cents we are up 41% today 155% this week and we more than 8X in the last month now time and time again we see how the smart money how the Wales they tend to front run moves like this because have a look at this Twitter post here Wales keep accumulating H bar as the H bar tokens tended to leave the exchanges and that post is from yesterday and we can see how the largest accounts the 100 million token accounts tended to get most of the supply now what got front run over here probably this news there's a filing of an ETF for harar the harar ETF by K Capital group LC and what kind of impact does a filing like this have what kind of impact does the whale accumulation have it made hedera hash craft the top performing in the 100 largest tokens here have a look at this table this is the top 100 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap ordered by their performance in the last week and hia hash graph or the H bar token is at number one and so in US Dollars it's very close to its all-time high that had been in September of 2021 at roughly 50s again now we are at 35 cents now the price might not be at an all-time high but something else definitely is so this is the long-term price chart but have a look at the long-term market cap chart the peak used to be at 6.6 billion now we are at 13.5 billion so this shows how much the supply of H bar increased over time this is actually rather interesting most altcoins that already had a bull run in a prior cycle cannot regain their prior price stops because the supply expands over time with the H bar token there is a real possibility we only need to grow another 46% so just another day like today and we are at an all-time high in price and that happened despite the need for way way more Capital now compared to 3 years ago now I like to look at altcoin prices relative to bitcoin not necessarily relative to the US dollar because the US dollar expands over time right the supply increases by roughly 6.8% per year so of course if you measure anything in US Dollars over the long term prices tend to go up for everything at the same time the comparison to bitcoin makes sense because there is a lot of correlation within crypto right when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well and vice versa in other words if you invest into an altcoin you need to expect more performance compared to bitcoin because Bitcoin is the safest of the cryptocurrencies more risk long-term should equal to more return otherwise it doesn't make sense to take on that additional risk and so have a look at this chart here this is hbar long-term relative to bitcoin and since September of 2019 we did not necessarily outperform even with this recent rally we still down by 58% if you bought during the hype in September of 2021 and you just recently sold so the very worst time to buy into H bar You' now be down by 93% now there's another interesting metric we can have a look at the H bar dominance what does this mean it means how much of the entire cryptocurrency market cap is currently in HB so we can see how did HB perform relative to all of crypto not just relative to bitcoin because Bitcoin of course over the very long term tends to beat most other alt coins and so with that recent rally we are at an all-time high the top in market cap in November of 20121 was also a relatively high level in dominance but since most cryptocurrencies rather underperformed Bitcoin the H dominance is at an all-time high we are 60% higher compared to November of 20121 now there is a very interesting effect recently happening I noticed this a few days ago that suddenly out of nothing it seems like advertisers are willing to pay more money in order to advertise on YouTube so there's this metric called the CPM or the cost per Mill and here is what happened with that metric this is the development on my channel and most of the times advertisers were willing to pay maybe around $10 or so for 1,000 views now that recently doubled in other words it seems like maybe the centralized exchanges and crypto project Etc they want to bring in new investors and one vehicle to advertise is of course to also push up prices of tokens that you hold the majority off because check this out this is the trading volume of harar on the spot Market in the last 24 hours 16% is by binance 4% is by white bit which is a white labeled version of binance and here we've got the perpet Futures Market also dominated by binance so the way this practically works is that you remove liquidity from the centralized exchanges so you move this for example into C Storage the thing that we looked at at the beginning of this video then the order boook gets very thin and then it doesn't take that much money in order to push up the price and of course Rising prices are very attractive for retail investors right there aren't too many people that are interested in crypto when prices are low funnily enough most people are interested in crypto when prices are very high now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stable coin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stable coin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collapse so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us deped the market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FTX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stable coin market cap going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly heated what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to Peck at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential floor here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the alt coins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of a i agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can we buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet tracking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bit boy crypto sold virtual tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2,500 per. who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky plays regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these buy and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle chesse that bought $100,000 worth of the token and that was at 48 and so here is Kyle Chessie he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin tray.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dedicated chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel for you to check it out it's currently $65 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first 7 days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it still make sense to buy H bar right now I do think that the current manipulation by the market makers by the centralized exchanges could continue that being said I'm personally more interested in tokens that haven't red that much but that still have a lot of ownership by the centralized exchanges so what we're looking for is a lot of ownership by the centralized exchanges very little trading volume on chain and ideally of course also a relatively small market cap so that the r can continue for a bit longer because for example with Dogecoin the market cap is already that large that it can't that easily do another 3 4 5x with h bar we are at 13 billion and a 3X would already put it in the Realms of cardano a 5x would put it into territories of Dogecoin so that's the art of crypto right it's trying to buy low and sell High ideally buying something low that has at the same time positive momentum if you got some value on this video feele to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKb4c3U56co,"['Bitcoin', 'Dogecoin', 'Cardano',

Prediction, LCX longterm, LCX Tokenomics,   #Lcx #altcoin #crypto","what is happening with the lcx token the token by the centralized exchange the lickstein crypto asset exchange why is it going up that much who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people are not considering so we are currently at 32 cents we are up 29% today 204% this week and almost 350% this year and the whole idea of lcx is that it's properly regulated that it's in the European union and that it's in lickstein right a place where all the capital in Europe is ironically though the lcx token is not mainly traded on the lcx exchange it's mainly traded on coinbase so 72% of all spot trading volume happens on coinbase and there are no Perpetual futures for the token so no manipulation via derivative contracts a quick look at the socials before we have a look at the onchain metrix we've got 107,000 followers on Twitter 12,000 members in Telegram and 90,000 followers on chain and that compares with 29,000 holders on the ethereum blockchain so we do have some data to work with of course not all of those 29,000 holders are created equally some of them have a few cents of the token others have hundreds of thousands of dollars of the token we're going to look at this in a second and so we are seeing how there's a lot of small buyers today so there's 62 buyers versus only 38% sellers the buying volume though is only 53% versus 47% % so the sellers tend to move more money than the buyers do at least on average per account and so with that price ready we do see a lot of new wallets suddenly interacting with the token so we see the number of new wallets per day on the left and on the right we see this normalized to 100% versus The Returning users and we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over we might see a new alltime high who knows but we definitely see how over the last month there's more and more news users relatively speak coming in so this is positive momentum this is exactly what we want to see when we zoom out a little right since the token started trading in March of 2019 we can clearly see how the token gets sometimes these waves of attention and very often exactly those kinds of attention waves correlate with price movements as well so this on the left side is not the trading volume it's simply the number of wallets the number of buyers and sellers over time on the right side again we can see this normalized to 100% per day no clear long-term trend is observable and so here is I think what a lot of people do wrong in crypto when you start out in crypto you simply just look at us dollar prices you're figuring out is it currently going up or down how much longer could the really last the problem though is when we buy an altcoin we want to get outperformance versus for example just holding Bitcoin right when we buy Bitcoin we've got the safest of the crypto assets when we buy something like a centralized exchange token we have more risk and that risk should get compensated with more return long-term because we all know what potentially can happen with centralized exchange tokens right there was the ftt token by The Exchange FTX which pretty much went to zero when the customer funds were lost I'm not saying that the same will happen for lcx I'm simply just saying that this is in general a risk with all centralized exchange tokens and that risk should get compensated and so what we've got over here is lcx divided by the Bitcoin price so the relative performance of lcx relative to bitcoin and since the end of 2019 19 to today we have seen an outperformance of more than 6,000 per. most of that outperformance happened though directly after launch so in the last four years we didn't see that much outperformance and we do see somewhat of a trading range we are not yet at the top end of that trading range versus Bitcoin we could potentially still go up by 115% roughly it's very interesting how those tops align right there seems to be some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy especially on relative valuation charts we very often see how tops align how bottoms align how capital is simply just flowing from token to token and it's going there where currently the attention is and then the attention moves to another token right so we see those swings relatively constantly across all those kinds of relative valuation charts now I don't just want to talk about lcx I also want to share a little bit of a nugget in case you don't yet know how to plot those charts when you go to tradingview.com you can click here at the top left and instead of just entering lcx USD you can also enter for forward slash and then for example enter BTC USD so then you get the relative variation of in this case the lcx token relative to BTC this also works for other tokens right you could go with lcx relative to eusd or you can go with lcx relative to the ftt Token right you can have a look at all of those kinds of ratification charts to get a feeling of where currently the flows of capital are moving and so let's have a look at the onchain metrix in terms of the number of holders for for the retail investor and for the whale investor and the way we make this differentiation is with minimum holding thresholds so the problem with this number over here right the 29,000 holders is again that there are some wallets in there that just have a few cents of the token they don't really matter but with those minimum holding thresholds we do have the wallets that actually matter so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 3,000 lcx tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token that's what I consider retail there's roughly 10,000 such so a third of the holders on chain have more than $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now 30,000 tokens there's only 2,200 such wallets and then on the right another 10x so that's now 300,000 tokens or $100,000 worth of the token it's very interesting how we see those waves and how we see the constant accumulation but it's also interesting how the number of whale investors actually is going down since November of 2021 so it's kind of like the way Wales are dumping on retail again since November 2021 for the last 3 years so since this point over here so there was continued accumulation by retail but the Wales started dumping since that point that's why lcx wasn't able to outperform bitcoin so here's November of 2021 since then the number of retail investors roughly doubled and so this gives us already a pretty good clue what to do very long term right lcx might be a good trading opportunity shortterm but for holding it over many many years it's probably not the very best vehicle because we don't anymore get the risk compensated because the whales are dumping pretty constantly and so the question is always about upside potential but it's not really that clear for a centralized exchange token we've got $251 million in market cap but a lot of this is also tokenomics the Q coin KCs token has 1.4 billion the okx token so okb has 3.2 billion and the market cap doesn't necessarily have to be aligned with the usage on chain yes it's a potential opportunity as a trading vehicle it might make sense to set a trailing stop-loss so with trailing stop losses I mean as the price goes up you want to adjust your stop- loss and when then the price turns around you want to exit very quickly but besides that for holding this over many many years it's probably not the best thing again I believe that the whales tend to make better decisions than small retail right small retail simply just buys and hes the whales tend to trade more actively and they've got most of the money because they probably did the right trades in the past and there is some kind of a correlation of past performance to Future performance because crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the whales tend to be on average more skilled than just small retail and the whales tend to sell long-term now here's the thing I believe that most upside potential is in the small market cap tokens and it's especially in the meme coins have a look at this in the last s days what performed the best it's all meme coins and it's hundreds of percent potentially we talked about ch guy early on this channel we talked about bully early on this channel we also talked about the tits token early on this channel so feel free to follow here because here's the problem once a token Rises to a certain market cap it takes a lot of capital again to double and triple the token and especially for meme coins that do have a lot of risk that can easily go down by 50 60% you do still want to see the upside potential and so when the market cap is already pretty high in the billions of dollars then there is not that much upside potential but there's still the downside potential so the risk ver what isn't that great have a look at this this is the largest meme coins in the last week pretty much everything went down only Dogecoin went slightly up so once a mem coin has risen to a certain level it's time to be cautious it might make sense to go into the tokens that are not in the billions but only in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but the question is always how can we pick the right small meme coin right there are so many small mem coins how do we not get burn burned and I believe the answer to this is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and once we've got a wallet of a certain influencer of somebody that moves markets of somebody that is a top Trader of somebody that did do the right things in the past once we have those wallets we've got a very nice mechanism to filter what to buy and what to sell have look at this so this is Martini guy and he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 so that was even before the listing on radium so that was directly on the pump. fun ecosystem platform when he bought his position went up by more than 4,000% of course it subsequently collapsed but that's the idea of trading right you don't just want to buy and hold meme coins mem coins are a rotation game you want to be in as long as the momentum is positive and you want to exit very quickly once it turns around I have a look at this here another alert by the martini guy he bought the fatest token again Direct directly on pump fun and again a very similar development so the purchase happened directly on the platform subsequently the price went up by a th000 680% and then came crashing back down now what's important with buying tokens that early with tracking other influencers is that first of all we have to take profit but secondly also we have to be somewhat Diversified we can't bet half of our portfolio on a single bet this is very risk on so here again the martini guy he bought chippy and that was at 2 2022 here are his purchases now it's at 206 so there are trades that don't necessarily always work out it is a game of Risk versus reward you want to buy when the upside is still there you don't want to buy the meme coins that are in the billions of dollars but when going risk on like this it's more important than with any other strategy not to lose everything right it's important to make small bets every now and then and then take profit when those make multiple X returns and so that's why I made several tutorial videos on the topic on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification of course also on onchain tracking Etc now I've talked about him now often enough so here is that guy this is Martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers and we track 12 of his wallets we did this through onchain analytics we found out some of his wallets but check this out this is Alex Becka's Channel we also track his wallets he's got 1.5 million subscribers now when he talks about a token it puts that much attention on the token that of course the price has to rise we've got also 12 of his wallets we're also tracking Crypt Benta with 1.1 million subscribers we've got 33 of their wallets and so I really believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's not just buying random tokens that are funny that are in some kind of list of trending tokens I think it's much more important to follow the Insiders it's to follow the early money it's to follow the people that have more attention that can push prices higher I like this strategy of wallet tracking that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course on just that so it's eight videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to discuss our onchain analytics we have to compare what kind of conclusions we come to that's why we've got our dedicated Chats on the individual allcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you so do I think that lcx can go higher from here yes of course it can with the General market right as crypto is currently expanding Bitcoin is going up ethereum is going up then lcx can go up as well and the momentum currently is positive there is potentially still a relative outperformance of 2x that being said I don't think it's the very best long-term investment over many many years and I do think that most upside potential is currently in rather the smaller assets if you got some Val video If you to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow

it was one of the most successful videos on this channel where there is a tension there's also price increases in this video I want to look at onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's try to find out whether or not eia can withstand the overall downtrend in this market so we're currently at 7 cents up 4% today this week we are up by almost 9% and since listing on coin market cap 2 weeks ago we pretty much just went sideways why is that when the overall attention on eia is rather high right this here in Gray is an average video and the video on ath had more than double the amount of views and it's still getting searched let's try to find out what could depress the price here we've already talked about the fundamental so feel free to check out that video Let's now have a look at tokenomics let's have a look at token inflation so that's what we are seeing over here in this chart this is the number of a tokens over time and we are currently at 19 billions and this will up to 23 billions one year from now the demand has to grow with the same pace so roughly 20% perom for the price just to say flat so if you're currently buying eere you're betting that the demand will outgrow that token inflation now let's have a look at that demand let's have a look at how much the demand is growing let's also check out how many retail investors are buying in versus whale investors let's segregate based on holding size so that's what we seeing over here on the left side we see the number of Wallets on the ethereum chain that have at least 15,000 a tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,400 that's what I'd consider retail at least on the ethereum Chain where the gas fees are pretty high in the middle we've got medium siiz retail so that's now a 10x in minimum holding so that's 150,000 tokens on the right we've got another 10x so that's now the Wales we can see how the Wales didn't really grow that much in number recently but there was a massive jump for medium-sized retail and small retail on the 24th of June yesterday the number of wallets tripled so that's here for small retail for medium-sized retail it also almost doubled now let's have a look at the mega whales let's have a look at the demand for centralized exchanges because have a look at the holders the first four wallets are smart contract wallets that's probably relating to token unlocks as investing schedules Etc but then we've got quite a bit of holding by okx by bybit by gate.io by qoin by bitg by mexc by swissborg by crypto.com pretty much all of the centralized exchanges are part of the party and those tokens are not necessarily owned by the customers a lot of those tokens might simply be sent from the team to the centralized exchanges for the listing so are the centralized exchanges selling off the answer is yes and no they do hold quite a bit let's go from one centralized Exchange to the next so there is some selling it's not aggressive but there is some gradual selling this is depressing the price so that was the okx wallet next we've got the buybit wallet which is pretty constant let's check the next centralized exchange this is rather accumulating the next one is holding another one holding more holding slight selling but very very slight and more holding maybe accumulation as well so a lot of Supply is held by the centralized exchanges they aren't yet selling they are also I believe not yet manipulating the price because when we look at the trading volume relative to the market cap it's actually not that elevated here is where I've got that from this is coin gecko this is the trading volume on various centralized exchange a lot of trading on htx and bybit then comes bitet okx gate.io Etc all the centralized exchanges we've already looked at before and here are the Perpetual Futures contracts not really that much trading volume so the number of holders is increasing quite a lot the price isn't and that might be because of selling of centralized exchanges but there's not a lot of manipulation apparently because whenever prices get manipulated we very often see elevated trading volume especially on the derivatives Market on the peret Futures market now I believe we are currently in a pretty dangerous situation in crypto because the stable coin market cap isn't going up anymore a very similar situation to March and April of 20122 afterwards we saw the teral Luna collapse and that then started the decline in in the stable coin market cap and with it also the crypto prices so we've seen an expansion of crypto since October of last year that expansion has halted and so when there's no more money flowing into crypto then it's very hard to make money with trading crypto right it's 100% player versus player prices in aggregate I believe are not going to rise from here again because Fiat isn't flowing into the system thus I believe it makes sense to bet on falling prices especially of cryptocurrencies that t to underperform quite consistently I personally am betting on this crypto to continue to do poorly it did already Fall by roughly 50% this year and I made a tutorial for the premium members the link is down below how to short this as in how to make money when this continues to go down the reason why the chart is going down is of course because of token inflation so more and more tokens hit the market thus the underperformance is relatively constant I made the calculation if the decline will continue at the same Pace as right now then if you've got roughly $33,000 to put just on this particular position then you're already making your money back for premium so if your crypto portfolio is in the few thousands of dollars not just in the few hundreds then feel free to check it out again it's the bitcoin.com if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough though there's also a free telegram group link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting

#cryptotrading #bybit #OKX #bitcoinholders","what's up guys and welcome back to another video in today's video I'm going to be talking about five altcoins and one meme coin that you can't be missing out on right now as you know mem coins are actually absolutely exploding altcoins are absolutely exploding and there is money to be made if you're sitting in Bitcoin of course Bitcoin is one of the best assets in the world if not the best however I think there could potentially be more gains from another altcoin or a different meme coin potentially of course this is inherently very risky and do your own Financial research but in today's video I'm going to give you the five altcoins which you cannot afford to be missing out on in this market as of right now because in December they could be seeing a massive massive pump as we can see on the Bitcoin dominance chart right here guys we can see it is breaking out of this potential Rising wedge formation right here to the downside that means all the money is going to start flowing out of Bitcoin into altcoins into mem coins that is where the money is made as you know from the previous bull cycles the altcoin seasons are absolutely beautiful I wait for these moments for years simply because the gains are absolutely unmatched when it comes to bitcoin so let's get into today's video let's talk about first of all the total market cap we can see the total market cap of all crypto is exploding towards the upside not only that but the total market cap the total three market cap is also coming to its all-time high we can see right here it's getting very very close from an all-time high of about 1.13 trillion and this is the market cap excluding Bitcoin and excluding ethereum as you know ethereum is also a very very good project however you may be not going to get the gains which you're looking for if it's your first cycle or maybe it's your second cycle or third and you just want to make some more money probably Bitcoin or ethereum is not for you let's first of all talk about this first one which I want to talk about which is pyth Network as you know you've probably heard me mention this many times before is currently sitting at a market cap of about 1.83 billion with volume pretty pretty Prett decent volume to be honest and of course it's listed on all the major exchanges now why do I like this well first of all it's basically very similar technology to chain link in the previous runs chain link did really really well however I'm a little bit worried that chain link is a little bit of an old narrative coin and I want to be putting my money my Capital into new narrative coins and although the technology may not be as good as chain link I think the price and the chart could way way exceed it and again in the short term I really do think we are going to pump to the upside and reach this target right here of around 80 to 85 C which is in the golden pocket guys I really do think this is a good play if we look at it on the daily chart as well and take a zoom out it's also looking very very nicely it's looking very very bullish guys I've been talking about it on the channel ever since it was down here in this um bullish pattern right here about to break and also all the way back here before it pumped so I really do think it is good I do hold a a decent amount of pip however I will be buying more in the near term the second one which I want to talk about is a meme coin guys but before we get into that I want to update you about my trade over on bch X So currently right now I am in a t Tia long position and it's not a crazy amount a crazy trade however I really do think when we take a look at this it's going to do really really well we can see it's been very bullish over the past few weeks I think it's going to go on and outperform many different altcoins that's why I'm in this long position and that's why hopefully my liquidation price right there is going to be good enough to last and see the pump coming very very soon guys of course as you know I'm using bonex for pretty much all my trades right now it's no kyc and also you don't have to submit any documents you don't need to submit your ID your passport your driver license your utility bills all this headache you don't need you literally just need a name and an email and guys there's a massive bonus going on right now not these crazy bonuses where you see 30 or $50,000 because actually to get those bonuses you have to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars this is a realistic bonus that you watching this at home can go ahead and get there's only 100 uh available and probably most of them already gone as well so right here if you deposit only $1,000 you can get $200 in a trading bonus which is really really nice and if you don't want to deposit $1,000 $100 gets you $20 so you're getting a really really nice deposit bonus your name and your email or not not even your name just your email and your password and you can go ahead and get yourself an account and to start trading today so the second one I want to talk about is Bone book of meme now you may be saying Jack why are you bringing me a mem coin with a 650 million market cap that's already very very large well you will see exactly why I'm bringing it to you guys and I've been talking about it in in the charts because when you take a look at the chart right here guys and we take a bit of a zoom out it's starting to look very very bullish we can see this almost falling wedge like situation right here going towards the downside and when that breaks we're going to see a massive explosion in the price up to these price levels right here even if we pull out the FIB right here and we take a little bit of a look right there we can see that these key levels right there are in fact having levels of resistance right there right there and also right there combined with the downward sloping level of resistance and the 236 we can see that when we do in fact see a breakout from here we're going to see a push up to the 382 and then follow upward to the go run pocket now you've got enough time right now if you were going to go ahead and buy this of course do your own research but there is potential right here from the current price of around 120% just to that golden pocket and if we do see meme meme season take off like a lot of people are expecting it could fly even higher so I really really do think this one is going to do very very well in my opinion the next one which I want to talk about you may have seen it featured in videos recently it's called Zeta chain Zeta now I'm not the biggest believer in the tech of Zeta chain I'll be completely honest I don't know a crazy amount about it I'm just talking to talking to you about it from a technical standpoint when you're taking a look at the technical analysis on the charts because it is looking really really good with a market cap of only 5133 million it's not even too crazy to be honest and if we take a look at the uh Twitter socials right there it's got a nice big following right there over on Twitter so we can see that also when we take a look at the chart right here on Zeta we can see that it's looking really really nice so look at this chart right here it looks like it's about to go ahead and see a push towards the upside because it's about to break this 236 honestly this is one of the best charts in crypto right now if we are going to see a push towards the upside it's going to be looking really really nice right here we can see that if we just go ahead and break this level right here it's going to see around a 40% gain or to the golden pocket over 100% And it's really looking nice in my opinion I'm going to be buying this on spot and also entering a trade with it probably on bit next of course the link is down below no kyc no restrictions I'm going to be opening a very very nice trade on this probably a 2 to 3x so that my uh liquidation price can actually be under this level right here so if I can use the chart correctly if the liquidation price is going to be under here or at least under this kind of 50 c range probably it's going to be safe for the bull market so I think it's a really really good play we're seeing higher highs right there look higher highs all the way there and I think it's looking very very good the next one which I want to talk about the fourth one is in fact fat OD arcial super intelligence Alliance this has a massive market cap however I think it could do really really well this bull market of course we can take a look and it's been around for a while however I think it could do really really well with a massive pump in the O coin kind of mini market mini high right here back in March April of around $310 currently sitting at a187 and when we take a look at the chart it's looking pretty good because again we take a zoom out and take a look at the chart it's looking pretty nice so we got a lot of levels to look at and work with here first of all we just broke out of the 382 right there I am uh expecting some kind of a pullback to the 382 like we can already see right there there's a red Candlestick if we were to zoom in and take a look at that and then I'm expecting a further test of the 0. five and then the gold and pocket right there before going on to to reach the resistance right here at around $2.70 so I really think it is a good play probably not the best one on this list but definitely a good token to have in a well balanced portfolio in my opinion and I really think it could do well if we take a look at the price to the the percentage to the all-time high around 90% which is very good and I think potentially it could go higher with this bullish narrative this bull market the final one which I want to talk about guys is Aerodrome Finance now you probably heard me talk about this many times on my Channel or even on my second Channel allcoin Jack where I really get into some djm plays this is not so much to dgen with a market cap of over a billion however I think it could do really really well now if we take a look at the chart right here of Aerodrome Finance we can see that it's in a pretty good position right now actually it's inside already the golden pocket which definitely is not bad news it means that the price um I mean obviously buying below the0 236 would have been amazing and some of the coins on this list like Zeda are below that level so potentially they could do exactly what Arrow did right here however they haven't yet so you can catch them and hopefully see a little bit of a return but we can see right here it is in this golden pocket and it is looking to push higher and I think it can easily push the all-time high of about $240 from the current price it's around 55% till we get there and I really do think it is bullish right now and again I think it's going to do well over the next few months and uh weeks and of course it's uh on the base chain which I'm very very bullish on if coinbase decide to have an air drop on the base chain I think it could do really really well and um aerodrone finance will absolutely explode like pancake swap did back in the altcoin uh defi summer which we saw few years ago so I really think this is a good one and let's just recap and go over what we were talking about we got pyth right here and this is in no particular order we' got bom book of meme right here we've got Z chain right there we got artificial super intelligence Alliance fet right there and we've got aerod drone Finance right there and of course we've got that massive bonus right here on bitex if you did want to go ahead and trade and get a nice bonus right there I really recommend doing it no kyc no documents nothing you can trade without anyone knowing whether that be your wife or the government I don't know who that might be but you can leave that I can leave that up to you right there so go ahead and sign up to Big next and um go ahead and take a look at the charts of some of these o coins and I'll catch you in the next one",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFNB_fMVs0Y,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Safe', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FFNB_fMVs0Y/hqdefault.jpg,2024-12-01T10:32:25Z

Analysis, Champ Review, Champ Price, Champ Price Prediction, Champ longterm, Champ Tokenomics,  #superchamps #champ #crypto","today is not a great day in crypto most cryptocurrencies go down but the champ token is going up what's going on here why is everybody buying champ let's have a look at how much longer this rally can last and if this is a natural Rally or if this is a pump and dump we're going to look at onchain data we're going to look at what is driving the price action we don't draw random lines on charts we actually try to figure out what's currently moving the prices now here are the largest trending tokens on the base chain and the champ token is at place number nine in terms of liquidity there's 6.4 million locked up and just have a look at the performance in the last 24 hours most things went down but champ is like a champion and so this is then how that looks like on a price chart we have seen way more buyers than sellers today 62% buyers only 38% Sellers and the buying volume relative to the selling volume is even more out of balance now in order to figure out where the price might go we can't just look at the website this is a mistake a lot of people do right A lot of people just look at the very easily accessible data I think it's more important to look at what's actually happening on chain now before we look at the onchain data I always like to look also at the social metrics as in is there potentially some kind of manipulation going on does it make sense when we look at the number of holders relative to the number of Twitter followers relative to the number of followers on telegram for example now on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 434,000 followers that's a huge account the the Discord channel has only 4,800 members so roughly 1% of the Twitter followers this is not really natural the ratio shouldn't be 100 to 1 the number of holders on chain on the base chain is 7,000 so something seems to be going on with that Twitter account I'm not sure if those accounts are bought bot accounts or if there was a big promotion to follow specifically the Twitter account but this is definitely not natural the token ownership is somewhat concentrated 19% of the entire token Supply is in a single wallet and other wallets also own quite a bit the smaller wallets only hold 7.5% of the supply now one might think that that's okay because maybe a lot of centralized exchangers own the token but that is actually not true the trading happens on Aerodrome so directly on the base chain and so we see a real shift happening since the 20th of November a lot of new users entered the token more than 10,000 on a single day yet currently today there's less than 7,000 holders so a lot of accounts that bought the token and subsequently sold everything again on the right side we see the same kind of data but here normalized to 100% per day so how many returning users are there versus new users per day we can ignore this data point on the 18th of November because at that day there was not a lot of activity right one new user versus eight returning users not a data point we can infer anything from here we have got something very similar this shows the number of buyers and sellers per day and again a massive Spike on the 20th of November but it's still interesting to see how this is fluctuating right this is not very stable recently we do see more buyers than Sellers as we did today but it's not really a constant predictable Trend now there are two ways a token price can go up either the Wales buy up everything and they support the price or it's a lot of small retail investors that organically grow that tell each other about the token where the investor base is growing over time let's have a look at what's going on here on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 20,000 champ tokens so at the Cent price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the wallets that have at the Cent price is roughly $100,000 worth of the token in the middle it's exactly something in between it's a minimum holding of 10,000 so we've got 1,000 $10,000 $100,000 in minimum holding of the token and again this does not look very natural yes we do see accumulation across the board but this is not organic growth right this is like a step function this could also be a lot of Bot accounts now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stablecoin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stable coin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collapse so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us depack the market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FDX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stable coin Market kep going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly heated what we've got over here is again a stablecoin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to Peak at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between between this and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential flaw here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the alt coins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of a i agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can we buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet tracking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bit boy crypto sold virtual tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the gy Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2,500 per. who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky plays regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these buy and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle Chessie that bought $100,000 worth of the token and that was at 48 cents and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dedicated chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to buy the champ token now I'm not so sure I do believe that currently that rally is not very organic it seems like there might be some manipulation going on we've already seen this in the Twitter account we also see this in the number of holders over time I'm not saying that the price has to crash from here manipulation can go on for a while I personally prefer tokens where we see organic growth over long term and we can then exit before the Wales dump if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish vide regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

on the base chain now let's have a look whether or not it still makes sense to buy AI xbt let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's see who's buying and selling here to try to figure out whether or not this current rally is organic or if this is a pump and dump we need to figure out what's going on beyond the price action we need to find out what's driving ups and downs in the price because only then we can find out if it still makes sense to buy now here's a list of virtual protocol tokens those are all AI agents and it's the newest thing on the base chain Solana is all about meme coin trading the base chain is all about AI agents and over here we've got AI xpt it's down today but it's got a market cap of 172 million already and so everything surrounding the virtuals protocol seems to do pretty well recently there's more more usage of virtual itself as well so what we've got over here is the number of launched tokens per day day on virtuals and while 2 to 3 weeks ago that was still at around 50 per day now we are seeing more than a th000 per day we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over I have a look at this the trading volume per day it's now at 28.5 million no matter what metric for virtuals we are looking at it's all going up and so as an extension AI xpt is doing very well an increase of 73,000 in the last 3 weeks and again today we see a little bit of a bre but let's see what continues from here let's have a look at Social metrics let's have a look at onchain data now on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 56,000 followers in telegram we've got 4,000 members and on chain we've got 21,000 holders roughly now that's on the base chain there's also another version on Solana with 4,000 holders so in total it's roughly 25,000 holders and that doesn't really match up with the number of followers on Twitter right so it seems like there is some kind of manipul ation happening on the Twitter social media account now that manipulation seems to also partially at least continue on chain have a look at this year this is the number of new users versus returning users per day and for whatever reason we see this huge Spike on the 22nd of November this does not look natural at all so this might be the team this might also be some Rogue player that simply tried to figure out what to do with certain Bots but we can definitely say that those 11,000 holders are not just natural growth it makes zero sense that on the next day we've got very low new user numbers again and then we've got this massive massive Spike on a single day we can see the exact same Spike over here it seems like a lot of small wallets got created to maybe artificially bring some attention to the token and so that then makes it also harder to believe these charts here they look very very healthy actually if this is 100% organic those are very good charts because they show the number of small retail investors that currently have roughly $1,000 worth of the token the number of medium-sized retail that's up to $110,000 and the number of Wales that's up to $100,000 worth of the token there is very nice constant growth across the board only the Wales recently in the last 3 to 4 days started to decrease in numbers that started on the 26th of November but it looks like the Wales aren't selling quickly enough to kill this Val right the price still went up by more than 200% since then and so we haven't seen those wh wallets move any funds whatsoever in the past now recently they take over more more of the trading volume so we've got the trading volume on the left in US Dollars we've got this on the right normalized to 100% it seems like the larger wallets tend to make up more and more of that trading volume over time and those are probably mainly selling transactions so as long as this doesn't collapse super quickly as long as the growth by small retail is still faster than the selling by the Wales you might continue to see some price appreciation the holding is pretty balanced so the percent that's held by the Wales and by large retail is somewhat high of course but there's no real Trend here we seem to be in equilibrium and so as long as the virtual protocol continues to grow I believe that the AI xpt token is likely going to appreciate as well is it now the best risk to reward bet I'm not so sure right if you want to be somewhat risk off it probably makes sense to Simply buy virtual directly if you want to get the upside potential it probably makes more sense to take the smaller of those AI agent tokens it appears to me that AI xpt is somewhat Stuck in the Middle right it doesn't have the perfect upside potential but it also doesn't really protect against the downside for that simply buying virtual itself I believe makes more sense now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stable coin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stablecoin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collaps so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us deped the market Market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FTX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stable coin market cap going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly it what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to pick at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential flaw here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the altcoins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of AI agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can wey buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet treking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bitboy crypto sold virtually tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2, 500% who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky Place regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these by and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle Chessie that bought $100,000 worth of of the token and that was at 48 cents and so here is K chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the bitcoin.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dtic chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I personally I do not buy the token I don't buy a ipt I think it's better to buy the smaller tokens they have more upside or to simply just allocate to Virtual directly because I do think that more and more trading volume will go to towards the AI agent space What meme coin trading with pump. fun is for Solana is likely going to be the virtual protocol with AI agent

fundamentals let's have a look at the data that most people are not looking at this is the r I'm referring to we are currently at 0.9 cents roughly and I'm not going to bore you with the marketing jazz on the website we probably not going to find out why the price is going up just based on that instead let's start off with the GitHub repository the place where programmers submit their code changes so you can see how much activity is there currently around noos and what we're seeing is an update 3 days ago another one 5 days ago last week another one last week so there seems to be activity this is not a dead project whatsoever it's a very technical project the documentation is also housed on GitHub and nervos has a strong support by the mining Community you can mine nervos tokens Asic miners now when you go to coin market cap you might consider checking out the chain Explorer that's this button over here but what's important is that this chain Explorer is actually not up to date the last block that's being shown here is 2 years old for whatever reason we still see an update on the UI but the age here is 2 years ago you click on a single block and you see this had been mind in 2021 instead you want to go to the main page noose. org and click on the Explorer over here that's where we get the real latest transactions with quite a bit of activity right 35 transactions in a single block and there are many blocks being mined regularly there's also a statistics page unfortunately not a lot about active wallets the hash rate is going up so more and more people are mining this and so the difficulty is going up as well in other words adoption by miners is faster than the token issuance that's in general very good but besides that we don't really know how much the chain is actually being used we've got the unique addresses used but that's growing pretty much linearly we've got the number of depositors and the am amount deposited that's not really growing for 4 years already unfortunately we've got the total Supply that's growing I've got more things to say about this in a second and here we've got the inflation rate which interestingly enough does not match the numbers that I see on chain nervos wasn't always in a rally we had our massive bull markets and subsequent crashs you want to be in altcoins when there is an altcoin rally which currently I think there is there's a lot of money flowing into crypto but have a look at the following this is the historical price chart this is the historical market cap chart we are not yet at all-time high market caps but we are way higher here in the market cap relatively speaking to the prior price action and when just looking at the price where the recent rally is just a bit of a blip that's an expression of token inflation that's an expression of more more tokens being circulating so you need to have demand growing at least as quickly as Supply and as a result of that inflation we get the chart behind me this is ckb so the noos token divided by ethereum relative performance and this did not look too pretty initially top to bottom we've seen a destruction of minus 94% from the beginning of this chart in January 2021 to today the underperformance was only 19% or so but still this shows us how important token inflation is now token inflation comes from many sources one of those sources is of course the mining another source might be token unlocks by early Beckers because noos did have Beckers check this out 28 million raised in a series a by poly chain Capital another 70 million raised through an Ico and then we got dragonfly Capital with an undisclosed amount that's been raised and so here's an article around the issurance we've got the base issurance it's currently somewhere around 20 billion but we've also got other issuance and that's now between 40 and 50 billion here's the token distribution 14% % private sale 21% public sale quite a bit of tokens also for the ecosystem and for strategic partners and for the team so this is not an entirely fairly launched cryptocurrency kaspa for instance was fairly launched this here is not have a look at the circulating Supply according to misari doio it's currently at 43 billion so that's closer to this chart than to this one and the expansion in the last year was according to that website 30% the mining inflation might be less but the total inflation at least according to misari doio is 30% that's quite High you need quite a bit of demand in order to offset that inflation inflation would be fine as long as attention stays high but I don't see that the number of telegram users is rather shrinking and so what's causing the hype it's probably two things it's an announcement that nervos is trying to become a scaling Solution on bitcoin so it's planning to integrate with the Bitcoin lightning Network and riding basically the Bitcoin scalability wave the second news is the upcoming Haring right and the idea is always when there's a Haring when there's a supply shock that potentially the price could go up at least psychologically still I don't really buy that Supply story right Supply is growing still quite fast and so again what is causing that rally why do we see the price go up by more than 160% in a month and we don't really see the fundamentals align that well can the news like the integration with Bitcoin lightning push up the price that much I'm not sure I think there's something else going on because have a look at the following numbers I do not like those numbers in the last 24 hours almost 1.5 billion worth of the token was traded on the Perpetual Market on binance that's with a market cap of only 376 million so on the Perpetual Futures Market on the derivatives Market more than four times the value of the entire market cap has changed hands on binance alone and there I say it I believe that's Market manipulation I think that binance is having their strong hands in that price Val I don't see strong growth just from the Explorer page I don't see strong growth in the socials I do see a lot of growth in the supply but that's not great for the price the only thing that I can see that's pushing this up is binance with its Perpetual Futures so I don't dare to predict where this price is going I cannot look into the heads of binance it might go further up if the price generates enough attention if it doesn't it might simply just come back down again if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you do consider to trade this R then make sure not to set any stop losses because I do expect more manipulation I do expect both wigs to the upside as

NFT basically creates a blockchain-based digital certificate for your digital collectables, including games, music, art, and many more. This certificate gives your artwork a unique identity. The Underlying technology and the programming language used by NFTs are the same as other cryptocurrencies ie. Blockchain and the programming language Ethash or Scrypt. On the other hand, NFT is a unique token; therefore, if you try to trade it, you may end up with something completely different in your hands. Cryptopunks is a remarkable example of NFT, it enables you to buy, sell and store 10,000 collectables with the proof-of-ownership being stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.  NFT has proved itself to be a boon in the lives of many others  - like Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter with his very first and famous tweet, just setting up my twitter,and Vignesh Sundaresan, famously known as Metakovan,who bought 69.3 million dollars worth of NFT art on Beeple. Owing to its increasing popularity, people are now willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for NFTs.  ‚û°Ô∏è About Post Graduate Program In Full Stack Web Development This program will give you the foundation for building full-stack web apps using the Java programming language.

week let's have a look at what's behind this rally who's buying here who's selling here does it still make sense to buy Sigma how solid is this rally so we currently at roughly 14 C we are up 29% today 101% this week almost 400% this month and almost 700% this year now Sigma is one of the largest trending tokens on the Solana chain when we order the trending tokens by the liquidity pool size Sigma is at number 10 we've discussed all of the other tokens that are visible on screen already on this channel and so let's have a look at what's going on what's driving this current rally is this another pump and dump and have we suddenly simply pumped to then subsequently dump again we have seen 85% Corrections in the past let's have a look at the onchain metrics but before we do this let's first have a look at potential obvious signs for manipulation let's compare the different social metrics so on chain we've got 17,000 holders on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 11,000 followers and in the telegram are 9,500 followers with roughly 10% being currently online so the numbers all somewhat make sense and we're not going to get any outperformance versus other players in the market simply just by looking at the website we want to see who's actually driving different price movements now the nice thing about Sigma is that there isn't any any trading off chain all the trading still happens directly on Solana and more than 80% of that trading happens directly on radium so there's no need to go to your binance or to your htx account you can only buy this by using directly a phantom wallet with radium so let's go back to those holders to those 177,000 holders not all holders are created equal some might only own a few cents of the token others might own millions of the token so let's split this up what we've got over here is the number of retail in investors versus whale investors on the left side we see the number of wallets with at least 7,000 Sigma tokens at the current price that's roughly worth $11,000 in the middle we've got the number of wallets with 70,000 tokens so that's worth $110,000 the right side we got another 10x that's now currently worth $100,000 we can see how small retail tends to just buy and hold and hope for the best this is very common for retail investors we see how the somewhat larger investors tend to sell a bit more actively and we can see how the whales they tend to buy very very early on and simply then afterwards distribute now for any meme coin to rise longterm we need to see a growing investor base right we need to see more and more new people coming into the token now let's have a look at how many new wallets actually bought the token based on different days so on the left side we've got the number of new Traders versus recurring Traders for any given day on the right side we've got the number of token transactions per day and we can see how this peaked on the 9th of October for the number of new Traders we can then see how on the next day on the 10th of October that peaked for the number of token transactions and so have a look at this while all those new people came into the token the price appreciated within just 5 days we went up by 600% almost and then once the trading action CED down the price tended to rather deflate and so we see very nicely how the adoption of Sigma happened into two waves we can also see this in the trading volume we see an initial wave of trading volume then rather calm trading action and then another Resurgence now this is split up by wallet cohorts again small retail being wallets with less than $1,000 worth of the token medium up to 10,000 large up to 100,000 Wales above 100,000 and we can see how large retail and the Wales had way more trading activity in the second wave for small retail that's not as obvious and so when we look now at the trading volume not measured in US dollars but we normalize this to 100% on any given day then we see how small retail tends to have less and less of a share of trading volume and so how much value is held by those different cohorts less and less is held by small retail even when we at mediumsized retail we see a very clear deduction of the Holdings it's really the Wales that are accumulating more and more and we see this on the right as well so when we don't normalize this to 100% but just look at the US dollar values the whales now hold almost $70 million worth of the token and again we can see how the smaller wallet cohorts tend to not sell in egate that much right small retail simply just buys and holds even for medium-sized retail that's somewhat true it's really the smart money that times the market that does find exit opportunities every now and then and the Wales did exit quite a bit on the 12th of October again that is when the price decline started and so it's all about timing in crypto right it's all about following the smart money the Wales tend to make the better calls than small retail because the Wales have played the game for a while that's why they've got so much money crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes and so besides onch analytics here's my Approach how to time the market and how to be as early as possible I like to track wallets of people that made profit in the past but also of influencers that tend to move markets for example we can see over here how AI Lim and Kyle chesse bought Sigma at around 7 cents now we are more than double that price here's Ari Lim's YouTube channel he's got 70,000 subscribers here is Kyle chess he's got 133,000 and from Kyle chesse alone we've got 12 wallets that we actively track of course not all of those wallets are known by the masses we also have 33 wallets by Crypt benter Krypto benter has more than a million subscribers on YouTube so does Alex Becker by the way we've got 12 of his wallets and so that's the idea right we want to follow the smart money we want to follow the money that moves the prices once we've got the signals from those track wallets we of course also discuss those signals in dedicated chat groups in premium so I think this topic is so important that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on that it's eight videos in length it's about how to find different influencer wallets how to then track them and how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking besides those eight videos there's more than a 100 other videos that's all about risk management about onchain analytics Etc feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% it looks like the Wales know what they're doing with Sigma it seems like they're speculating on adoption by the centralized exchanges now if you got some value a this video If you to subscribe I proba you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

Prediction, LCX longterm, LCX Tokenomics,   #Lcx #altcoin #crypto","what is happening with the lcx token the token by the centralized exchange the lickstein crypto asset exchange why is it going up that much who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people are not considering so we are currently at 32 cents we are up 29% today 204% this week and almost 350% this year and the whole idea of lcx is that it's properly regulated that it's in the European union and that it's in lickstein right a place where all the capital in Europe is ironically though the lcx token is not mainly traded on the lcx exchange it's mainly traded on coinbase so 72% of all spot trading volume happens on coinbase and there are no Perpetual futures for the token so no manipulation via derivative contracts a quick look at the socials before we have a look at the onchain metrix we've got 107,000 followers on Twitter 12,000 members in Telegram and 90,000 followers on chain and that compares with 29,000 holders on the ethereum blockchain so we do have some data to work with of course not all of those 29,000 holders are created equally some of them have a few cents of the token others have hundreds of thousands of dollars of the token we're going to look at this in a second and so we are seeing how there's a lot of small buyers today so there's 62 buyers versus only 38% sellers the buying volume though is only 53% versus 47% % so the sellers tend to move more money than the buyers do at least on average per account and so with that price ready we do see a lot of new wallets suddenly interacting with the token so we see the number of new wallets per day on the left and on the right we see this normalized to 100% versus The Returning users and we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over we might see a new alltime high who knows but we definitely see how over the last month there's more and more news users relatively speak coming in so this is positive momentum this is exactly what we want to see when we zoom out a little right since the token started trading in March of 2019 we can clearly see how the token gets sometimes these waves of attention and very often exactly those kinds of attention waves correlate with price movements as well so this on the left side is not the trading volume it's simply the number of wallets the number of buyers and sellers over time on the right side again we can see this normalized to 100% per day no clear long-term trend is observable and so here is I think what a lot of people do wrong in crypto when you start out in crypto you simply just look at us dollar prices you're figuring out is it currently going up or down how much longer could the really last the problem though is when we buy an altcoin we want to get outperformance versus for example just holding Bitcoin right when we buy Bitcoin we've got the safest of the crypto assets when we buy something like a centralized exchange token we have more risk and that risk should get compensated with more return long-term because we all know what potentially can happen with centralized exchange tokens right there was the ftt token by The Exchange FTX which pretty much went to zero when the customer funds were lost I'm not saying that the same will happen for lcx I'm simply just saying that this is in general a risk with all centralized exchange tokens and that risk should get compensated and so what we've got over here is lcx divided by the Bitcoin price so the relative performance of lcx relative to bitcoin and since the end of 2019 19 to today we have seen an outperformance of more than 6,000 per. most of that outperformance happened though directly after launch so in the last four years we didn't see that much outperformance and we do see somewhat of a trading range we are not yet at the top end of that trading range versus Bitcoin we could potentially still go up by 115% roughly it's very interesting how those tops align right there seems to be some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy especially on relative valuation charts we very often see how tops align how bottoms align how capital is simply just flowing from token to token and it's going there where currently the attention is and then the attention moves to another token right so we see those swings relatively constantly across all those kinds of relative valuation charts now I don't just want to talk about lcx I also want to share a little bit of a nugget in case you don't yet know how to plot those charts when you go to tradingview.com you can click here at the top left and instead of just entering lcx USD you can also enter for forward slash and then for example enter BTC USD so then you get the relative variation of in this case the lcx token relative to BTC this also works for other tokens right you could go with lcx relative to eusd or you can go with lcx relative to the ftt Token right you can have a look at all of those kinds of ratification charts to get a feeling of where currently the flows of capital are moving and so let's have a look at the onchain metrix in terms of the number of holders for for the retail investor and for the whale investor and the way we make this differentiation is with minimum holding thresholds so the problem with this number over here right the 29,000 holders is again that there are some wallets in there that just have a few cents of the token they don't really matter but with those minimum holding thresholds we do have the wallets that actually matter so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 3,000 lcx tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token that's what I consider retail there's roughly 10,000 such so a third of the holders on chain have more than $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now 30,000 tokens there's only 2,200 such wallets and then on the right another 10x so that's now 300,000 tokens or $100,000 worth of the token it's very interesting how we see those waves and how we see the constant accumulation but it's also interesting how the number of whale investors actually is going down since November of 2021 so it's kind of like the way Wales are dumping on retail again since November 2021 for the last 3 years so since this point over here so there was continued accumulation by retail but the Wales started dumping since that point that's why lcx wasn't able to outperform bitcoin so here's November of 2021 since then the number of retail investors roughly doubled and so this gives us already a pretty good clue what to do very long term right lcx might be a good trading opportunity shortterm but for holding it over many many years it's probably not the very best vehicle because we don't anymore get the risk compensated because the whales are dumping pretty constantly and so the question is always about upside potential but it's not really that clear for a centralized exchange token we've got $251 million in market cap but a lot of this is also tokenomics the Q coin KCs token has 1.4 billion the okx token so okb has 3.2 billion and the market cap doesn't necessarily have to be aligned with the usage on chain yes it's a potential opportunity as a trading vehicle it might make sense to set a trailing stop-loss so with trailing stop losses I mean as the price goes up you want to adjust your stop- loss and when then the price turns around you want to exit very quickly but besides that for holding this over many many years it's probably not the best thing again I believe that the whales tend to make better decisions than small retail right small retail simply just buys and hes the whales tend to trade more actively and they've got most of the money because they probably did the right trades in the past and there is some kind of a correlation of past performance to Future performance because crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the whales tend to be on average more skilled than just small retail and the whales tend to sell long-term now here's the thing I believe that most upside potential is in the small market cap tokens and it's especially in the meme coins have a look at this in the last s days what performed the best it's all meme coins and it's hundreds of percent potentially we talked about ch guy early on this channel we talked about bully early on this channel we also talked about the tits token early on this channel so feel free to follow here because here's the problem once a token Rises to a certain market cap it takes a lot of capital again to double and triple the token and especially for meme coins that do have a lot of risk that can easily go down by 50 60% you do still want to see the upside potential and so when the market cap is already pretty high in the billions of dollars then there is not that much upside potential but there's still the downside potential so the risk ver what isn't that great have a look at this this is the largest meme coins in the last week pretty much everything went down only Dogecoin went slightly up so once a mem coin has risen to a certain level it's time to be cautious it might make sense to go into the tokens that are not in the billions but only in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but the question is always how can we pick the right small meme coin right there are so many small mem coins how do we not get burn burned and I believe the answer to this is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and once we've got a wallet of a certain influencer of somebody that moves markets of somebody that is a top Trader of somebody that did do the right things in the past once we have those wallets we've got a very nice mechanism to filter what to buy and what to sell have look at this so this is Martini guy and he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 so that was even before the listing on radium so that was directly on the pump. fun ecosystem platform when he bought his position went up by more than 4,000% of course it subsequently collapsed but that's the idea of trading right you don't just want to buy and hold meme coins mem coins are a rotation game you want to be in as long as the momentum is positive and you want to exit very quickly once it turns around I have a look at this here another alert by the martini guy he bought the fatest token again Direct directly on pump fun and again a very similar development so the purchase happened directly on the platform subsequently the price went up by a th000 680% and then came crashing back down now what's important with buying tokens that early with tracking other influencers is that first of all we have to take profit but secondly also we have to be somewhat Diversified we can't bet half of our portfolio on a single bet this is very risk on so here again the martini guy he bought chippy and that was at 2 2022 here are his purchases now it's at 206 so there are trades that don't necessarily always work out it is a game of Risk versus reward you want to buy when the upside is still there you don't want to buy the meme coins that are in the billions of dollars but when going risk on like this it's more important than with any other strategy not to lose everything right it's important to make small bets every now and then and then take profit when those make multiple X returns and so that's why I made several tutorial videos on the topic on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification of course also on onchain tracking Etc now I've talked about him now often enough so here is that guy this is Martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers and we track 12 of his wallets we did this through onchain analytics we found out some of his wallets but check this out this is Alex Becka's Channel we also track his wallets he's got 1.5 million subscribers now when he talks about a token it puts that much attention on the token that of course the price has to rise we've got also 12 of his wallets we're also tracking Crypt Benta with 1.1 million subscribers we've got 33 of their wallets and so I really believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's not just buying random tokens that are funny that are in some kind of list of trending tokens I think it's much more important to follow the Insiders it's to follow the early money it's to follow the people that have more attention that can push prices higher I like this strategy of wallet tracking that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course on just that so it's eight videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to discuss our onchain analytics we have to compare what kind of conclusions we come to that's why we've got our dedicated Chats on the individual allcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you so do I think that lcx can go higher from here yes of course it can with the General market right as crypto is currently expanding Bitcoin is going up ethereum is going up then lcx can go up as well and the momentum currently is positive there is potentially still a relative outperformance of 2x that being said I don't think it's the very best long-term investment over many many years and I do think that most upside potential is currently in rather the smaller assets if you got some Val video If you to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow

longterm, Virtual Tokenomics,  #virtualsprotocol #virtual #crypto","what is going on with virtuals protocol the price of virtual is going up pretty consistently the question is who's actually buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the data most people are not considering let's look behind the price action now this is not the first video on Virtual on this channel I published one 36 days ago and initially not a lot of people were interested in the video but now it's picking up since the investor base is growing and since the price is rising another video followed 3 days ago that also tends to still underperform in other words just looking at the YouTube statistics it looks like we are still somewhat early there isn't too many retail investors that searched for the token just yet now that first video had been published when the price was still at 41 now we are at $152 so that's almost a 4X we are up 21% today 186% this week 340% this month and almost 3,000% since listing on coin Market cap in the middle of February of this year and so I publish videos on various meme coins and promising alt coins regularly on this channel I Tred to be early I try to find the things that still have some upside potential if you don't want to miss the next video feel free to subscribe over here now here's the virtuals protocol platform it's a Launchpad for AI agents and a lot of the tokens are already in the tens of millions some even in the hundreds of millions of dollar in market cap and just have a look at the performance of many of those tokens in the last day a lot of them are up quite a bit money is clearly flowing onto the platform have a look at this the Joe token up almost 600% again that's in 24 hours and so it very much looks like the base chain is now becoming the chain of AI agents Solana is a chain for meme coins Bas is a chain for AI agents and it seems like we're in general in a crypto market now that favors those launch platforms so here are the top trending tokens on the base chain number number one is the virtuals protocol with a liquidity of 46 million and that's even more liquidity than there is for wrapped Bitcoin but have a look at the other training tokens we've got Luna by virtuals we've got game by virtuals we've got AIX BT by virtuals and there's no such thing for the Solana chain right for the Solana chain it's all mem coin trading again most of those meme coins come also from a Launchpad from pump. fun and so when we search for Buy virtuals on Dex screen.com we get all of those various tokens that listed on the base chain a lot of them are going up but of course the price volatility of those AI agents is very comparable to the mem coins on Solana so for example for that Joe token that we just looked at we had a crash temporarily by 70% over here and so here's why I believe this AI agent narrative can take off with the use of virtual protocol for pump. fun we had the issue of capital dilution we had the issue that a lot of new tokens get launched every single day but the cap Capital gets concentrated in way less vehicles for virtuals have a look at the agents created per day that's not necessarily that much so if you're interested in not just buying the virtual token but actually buying the tokens of the individual agents it's not like tomorrow there will be another 10,000 tokens that launch and that then take away all of the attention of the token you currently hold that is very very different for pump. fun on Solana right pump. fun has tons of launches and so flip those tokens very very quickly is super vital have a look at this this is pump. fun the number of deploy transactions per day and that is currently at 50,000 and so here's what I believe will happen I believe that a lot of the trading from the Solana chain might move over to the base chain and we might see a real rotation happening from some of the meme coins to some of AI agent and so here's what I believe will happen I believe that a similar ecosystem on the base chain will develop where we've already seen for Solana so instead of meme coins we now have ai agents and there is still quite a bit of upside have a look at the total value locked across various chains Solana is at 9 billion the base chain is still at 3.5 billion so it could potentially still double or triple from here just in terms of total value locked across the entire chain and here's the problem with Solana Solana is already that large in terms of market cap that it cannot really outperform the rest of the market what we see over here is the Solana dominance so how much of all of crypto in terms of market cap is currently in Solana and that is at 3.6% currently and we haven't been much higher it seems like the air is getting thin here and that of course is also not necessarily very good for the individual meme coins on Solana right because if Solana goes down then of course the mem coins go down to a similar degree because they are one-on-one coupled in the liquidity pools with s so now how much upside is there currently specifically for the virtual token we are currently at a market cap of 1.5 billion and that puts it in the grand scheme of things at rank number 83 in terms of market cap that's not necessarily that large yes of course it's larger than a lot of individual meme coins but this is a launch pad that seems to get more and more traction if the virtual protocol was to double it would still be at a similar market cap to mental if it was to triple it would be close to bit tensor or render if it was to quid druple it would be close to ICP or haera hcraft I believe that the usage right now for the virtual protocol is higher than for all of the mentioned projects now the question of course is will that usage stay high or even better can it further expand from here now let's have a look at onchain analytics let's have a look at the token on the ethereum chain and the token on the base chain there's actually two versions of the token over here we've got the token on the base chain we've got 81,000 holders and over here we've got the token on ether scan with 9,600 holders there is something very odd happening but it could potentially be also a good sign now this is first the charts here on the base chain this is not ethereum this is base on the left side we see the number of retail investors and on the right side we see the number of whale investors and the way we make this distinction is by minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we have the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 virtual tokens in the middle 10,000 virtual tokens on the right 100,000 virtual tokens again the price is currently at $154 so this equates to $1,500 this equates to1 15,000 and this equates to $150,000 worth of the token this is all hyper bullish right we see accumulation across the board it is the fastest for more retail but also the Wales are buying very very quickly but here's the interesting thing we see the exact reverse effect on the ethereum Chain so here the number of holders tends to rather Trend downwards now I don't know if those kind of holders are selling to centralized exchanges and liquidate over there I don't know if this is bridging from ethereum to base but it appears as if at least for the very largest wallets this process is soon over and if this is actually selling pressure to to the centralized exchanges then that selling might stop at some point despite the potential selling pressure the price is still rallying pretty consistently and so here are those centralized exchanges most trading volume happens on bit hump followed by gate.io but we still have a lot of trading volume still on chain on Unis Swap and that's on the base chain this is not on ethereum we also have Perpetual Futures which are dominated by buybid and followed by Maxi and bitet so since there's so much interest in the token and since the number of holders is going up up and the price is rallying and there might be more and more expansion of the usage of the platform we're probably going to continue to see more and more accumulation by the market makers as well now here's a very interesting recent development you very likely do not have access to this kind of chart this here shows how much advertisers on my YouTube channel pay for 1,000 views of their ads and it's suddenly out of nothing spiked to roughly double of what it used to be in other words crypto projects centralized exchanges Etc is they are now competing for advertising space in the crypto scene and it's not just money that's flowing into advertising for crypto there's also simply Fiat money that's flowing into the space as a whole the stable coin market cap tends to rise and it's recently even accelerating so since October of last year we see money flowing into crypto again that of course causes a lot of crypto asset prices to go up and especially in the recent days since beginning of the month we also see the alt coins going up in aggregate so what we have over here is the other dominance this is how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 that went up by roughly 20% in the last month and so pretty much everything is now going up the art in crypto trading though is to buy early right it's to buy when the prices are still low so for example over here the chill guy token it's now at 50 cents but I made a video on chill guy when it was still at 20 cents and I hope a lot of you made money with that video because it was a quite popular one and so this is the real art right we have to get into tokens when momentum is bullish and when there's still enough upside potential and so this is what this channel is all about right it's about discussing tokens that a lot of people don't yet have on their radar so feel free to subscribe now how can I find tokens like chill guy early how can I find things like the go token or the ACT token early those are one of the largest pump. fun ecosystem tokens this is a wallet tracking alert how KY chesse bought the gold token for 4 that was over here since then the price went up by more than 500% temporarily it was up by more than 800% who's Kai chesse it's this influencer over here he's got 137,000 subscribers and he tends to be relatively early on trending tokens and so here is how that works we use onchain analytics again to figure out who is owning what wallet it's not a very easy task but we've got an entire community that just focuses on that single task find wallets that are very useful of insiders of top traders of influencers let's find those wallets and then track them so over here we've got the wallets that we Track by Kyle chesse we've got 12 in total well let's talk about the ACT token here's our signal for ACT Crypt benter bought the ACT token at 3.7 now it's at 58 cents so an increase of 1,500% since that and of course temporarily the gain was even higher more than 2,000% now where do crazy gains like this come from they come from attention they come from a lot of eyeballs getting into one single token and so here are those eyeballs this is the Crypt Channel they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token of course the token has to go up and so we've got 33 of Crypt banter wallets and so really I think this is the better approach compared to just drawing random lines on price charts I think it's better to follow the smart money it's better to follow the Insiders it's better to Simply copy trade the people that tend to make money in crypto and I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on this how can we find various influencer wallets how can we track those wallets and how can we subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total it's all part of Premium so that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about portfolio diversification risk management indicator back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we get our wallet signals we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare the onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual all coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything simply just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to still buy the virtual token does it make sense to invest in the virtuals protocol or is it better to buy the individual tokens of course the risk to reward might be better for the individual tokens if you write the waves properly if you don't get crushed by those temporary 70% drops however I do still think that there is some upside potential for virtual itself as well the market cap is already at 1.5 billion so we're probably not going to see a 20x from here but another doubling or another tripling is definitely possible if the usage continues to grow if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQtJ_AD5OqM,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Render',

gets very close to the 100K and thus it's not just Bitcoin that's going up it's also the altcoins especially the meme coins let's have a look at cerebro in this video we're going to look at onchain analytics we're going to look at the buyers and sellers we're going to look at what's currently driving the price to then derive whether or not it still makes sense to buy Zer bro now owning Bitcoin is nice and all but the real profits are to be made in the smaller tokens just have a look at this in the last 7 days a lot of tokens went up by hundreds of perc whip even doubled today Project 89 more than doubled and have a look at this right those are all rather small cap cryptocurrencies this is not in the billions this is actually where currently all the gains are made now I published a video on Sero before on this channel and it just performed like your average video so an average video is indicated here by this gray area yet at the time the price was 7.7 and now we are at 53 cents and so I cover meme coins regularly on this channel I always try to pick the ones that have positive momentum but that still have some kind of further upside potential so if you don't want to miss the next one feel free to subscribe here now zibro is a token that had been LED via pump. fun so the mem coin launch pad on Solana and it's currently got 22,000 holders on the Chain but not all of those holders are created equal some of them have just a few dollars worth of the token others have hundreds of thousands of dollars and and so let's have a look at what those different kinds of holders are currently doing on the left side we've got the retail investor on the right side we've got the whale investor in the middle we've got something in between so what we're seeing here is the number of wallets over time based on minimum holding thresholds so on the left side that's 2,000 tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token they're currently 6,000 such wallets the minimum holding for the wallet in the middle is 20,000 tokens so $10,000 worth of the token we have 2,200 such wallets and on the right we've got the Wales so we got another 10x that's now $100,000 worth of the token there are 563 such wallets and so this is exactly the kind of chart we want to see we have a very constant nice accumulation by the small retail investor we've got also consistent accumulation by mediumsized and even the whales they are not dumping despite the price going up now what's also interesting is not just the number of holders it's also how many new people come in especially relative to the recurring Traders so we look at now how many new wallets are created every day that trade with the token versus how many recurring trades do we see and that's visible here on the left chart now on the right chart we've got the number of token transactions that's a measure of how much attention there currently is on the token and so the firsttime Traders are here in purple on the left and on most days we see more first time Traders then recurring Traders this is exactly what we want to see we want to see a growing investor base and we don't want that existing Traders dump on each other now on the right side we've got the number of token transactions that peaked on the 10th of November and is now at a somewhat constant level probably one of the most insightful charts is over here on the left side we see the trading volume over time on the right side we see again the trading volume but this time normalized to 100% per day and we are now segregating again by those different wallet cohorts and we see very nice constant increase of trading volume this is exactly what we want to see this means increased attention but what we also see is that over time the larger wallets tend to trade more and more relatively speaking so even though the number of Wales isn't growing as quickly as the number of small retail investors it seems like their dollar cost averaging in heavier they make up more and more of the trading volume and that could mean that maybe a market maker is also part of one of those larger wallets and that could then potentially mean a listing on a centralized exchange because still most trading volume happens in a decentralized manner the token is listed on pretty much everything is listed on Maxi but they don't do much Market making they mainly just funnel orders through the actual price Discovery still happens on chain on Solana and so we can have a look at how much value is held by the different wallet cohorts and again we see a very fast accumulation by the Wales this went here from the 7th of November from 14 million to currently 57 million so the holding increased by 36x now compare this with small retail they mooved from 300K to 22 million so that's maybe a 7x roughly small retail accumulated much slower than the Wales yet over time the number of holders of course is increasing and that kind of data makes me rather bullish on the token now the big question is always how can we find something like zerro when it's not at 500 million in market cap but when it's still relatively small maybe at 50 million or 70 million right in the tens of millions not in the hundreds of millions this is where most of the gains are made now my answer to this question is wallet tracking have a look at this we got an alert by Kyle chesse that he bought zbro at 7.8 he did this in two transactions and since then the price went up by more than 500% so I don't think the best approach to crypto trading is necessarily just picking a random token in a list and just looking at where's currently the movement happening I think the best approach is to follow the smart money it's to follow the influencers it's to follow the Insiders is to follow the people that actually move markets and tend to make profitable trades and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 136,000 subscribers and we are tracking 12 of his wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets so for example we also track Crypt banter they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they mention a token the price definitely goes up because again attention is moved towards that token and more attention means more trading volume means more purchases means a higher price and so we've got 30 33 of Crypt benter wallets and so really I believe this is the way to make alpha in crypto it's trying to find information sources most people don't have it's digging a bit deeper than others it's following the smart money and so I like this wallet approach that much that I created a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track those influencer wallets and how can we subsequently interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com it's not just about wallet tracking we've also got onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about back testing it's also about risk management and portfolio diversification there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total and so once we've got a signal of course you also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to compare our analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so do I believe that cerebra will go higher it's definitely possible the upside is somewhat limited because we are already in the hundreds of millions not anymore in the tens of millions of dollars if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I pra you a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKUQyETOJLo,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'Maker', 'JUST', 'Zerebro',

unfortunately it hasn't always been the case let's have a look at some onchain analytics most people aren't looking at let's have a look at the long-term holders let's have a look at the Wales versus retail investors let's try to find out where this journey will bring us we are currently at 0.47 the price went up by 45% today alone but have a look at this this was a true roller coaster ride in the last month now I've made several videos on turbo on this channel and the first video published 1 and a half months ago actually outperformed your average video quite a bit there was a lot of attention on turbo at the time the subsequent video outperformed as well but barely the third video performed pretty much similarly to the second so there is somewhat declining interest for Turbo even though the volatility isn't going down at all let's have a look at the onchain metrics both for the ethereum based token but also for the Solana based token because there are two versions there's one on ethereum with 34,600 holders now not all of those holders matter to the same degree right there are a lot of holders that just have a few cents worth of the token let's put in some minimum holding thresholds so let's start off with the ethereum chain and let's segregate the number of holders based on a minimum holding threshold on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 200,000 turbo tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $9,000 that's the chart on the left that is what I'd consider retail for the middle chart we go a 10x in minimum holding so that's now not $900 but $9,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's $90,000 worth of the token it's interesting how it's solely retail that started buying in the middle of January of this year the whales actually rather tended to distribute they tended to sell let's have a look at just the last month where we got our massive ups and downs in the end we netted minus 23% in terms of price and here's the holder development on ethereum over that last month alone so in the last month alone actually all holder thresholds tended to accumulate so how is it possible when the number of investors is going up that the price actually isn't I believe there are two explanations one explanation is that simply the overall Market is going down and a lot of altcoins are one-on-one paired with ethereum right when you are buying the turbo token on a decentralized exchange you are swapping at least indirectly your ethereum for Turbo tokens so the ratio between ethereum and turbo determines the turbo price so turbo is actually priced in ethereum tokens in a decentralized manner when the ethereum price goes down in US Dollars then the turbo token goes down to the same degree in US do as well and so turbo went down by 23% ethereum went down by 20.6% so the price decline itself can mainly be explained by that ethereum drop however why didn't turbo outperform ethereum given that the number of holders increased everywhere I think this is where we might see some potential manipulation by the market makers because have a look at this 30% of trading volume happens on okx another 20% on gate.io HDX Mexi and bit get also own a lot of the trading volume of Turbo and so potentially those market makers got an early allocation and they are now Distributing right they are balancing out their portfolios I mentioned that there's also a version on the Solana chain and we actually have the exactly same charts for Solana as well these are the same kind of thresholds that we have for the ethereum based token and see the number of holders is much much lower we've got 2,000 holders in total but on Solana it's only 100 holders that have more than $900 worth of the token again for reference on ethereum that's almost 10,000 holders by the way all of those charts come from a tool that I've developed myself so you can plug in any ethereum based token into those tools you can pluck in any Solana token into the tools and then you can have a look at what are certain people doing with a token are the large whales selling is retail buying it's always very useful to see where the buying and selling pressure is potentially coming from if you want to get access to this tool it's available down below it's the Bitcoin trade.com that's the premium membership now here's something I don't like about the current market it's 100% player versus player and I've mentioned this in Prior videos and I'm not getting tired of repeating myself when there's no more Fiat flowing into crypto when the stable coin market cap is simply just flat then it's very very hard to make money in crypto returns are concentrated in just a few assets the vast majority of assets in such a market environment tend to underperform and so that's why I short I bet on falling prices of assets like this or like this or like this I think in this market it's much easier to find the losers than to find the winners I'm shorting the market I'm betting on falling prices and again I'm sharing what kind of assets I am betting on within the premium telegram channels there's also tutorials around this Etc there's also a free Telegram in case your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium that link is also down below looking very much forward to chatting with you over there as well see

#dot #crypto","let me tell you a story once upon a time there was an investor that paid more than $50 per dot now we are at $451 is this potential opportunity to buy low and sell high right that's in the end the goal let's have a look at the fundamental reason why poka dot did so poorly in the last years and let's try to find out whether or not this could change so here we are at $451 and at some point we were above 50 now what we're seeing over here is also a poka dot chart but it's slightly different it's poka dot relative to ethereum so by dividing the dot price by the ethereum price we take away the ups and downs of the market we look at idiosyncratic movements and that went from top to bottom down by more than 93% because this is how crypto in general works right when Bitcoin goes up and when ethereum goes up then the altcoins tend to go up as well and vice versa so by dividing by the Bitcoin price or by the ethereum price we can actually see does it make sense to own an altcoin does it make sense to take on more risk because when you take on more risk you should also get more return in the past this has not been the case for Poka do but again is this potentially the turn around let's first have a look at why the dot price actually underperformed ethereum that much I think it has a lot to do with token inflation there are simply more and more dot tokens that get issued over time and currently we at roughly 1. 5 billion but that will increase over time because of the staking rewards so if you currently stake your Dodge tokens you get an apy of 16.7% or 15% after commission let's say you did this in the last 2 years you still would have underperformed buying and holding ethereum quite a bit because the price went down by 64% roughly and so that's the problem right when not all of the tokens are circulating but quite a lot of it is staked is locked up and just a bit of additional Supply can depress the price disproportionately here is the number of dot tokens that got staked over time it seems to be growing over the long term and that should be positive because the more dot tokens are locked up the less circulating Supply there is the higher the price should be again the fundamental idea being that price is a result of supply versus demand when Supply decreases demand stay stable then the price should go up but just because more dot tokens got locked up for stake doesn't necessarily mean that the circulating Supply went down because check this out this is a different representation of the same thing this looks at the percent of dot that is staked over time and that actually went down it ran from 62% to currently 58% the inflation of dot tokens will be roughly 15% in the next year so there will be 15% more dot tokens if we now assume that roughly half of the dot tokens stay staked so the the staking will not increase and will not decrease then those 15% additional Supply will probably again depress the price relative to other cryptocurrencies by 30% so I do believe that this trend here will prevail now there is a bit of an issue here right because sometimes we do see temporary rallies that aren't too small 60% over here or 80% over here and so finding the right entry for a short position isn't that easy on top of that this is again the relative valuation chart so if we just short dot relative to the US dollar and then say Bitcoin and ethereum goes up then dot will also go up maybe not by as much but it will still go up right just compare those two charts this is the same kind of poka do chart but this is relative to ethereum and this is relative to the US dollar shorting relative to the US dollar is way more risky but there's a way actually to short relative to ethereum or say relative to bitcoin I personally have a lot of those shop positions open I do believe that a lot of altcoin tend to underperform bitcoin over the long term porka dot isn't that different and I don't share every single position that I've open here on the public YouTube channel this is what the premium membership is for but I do want to share how to find such positions so you go to defil l.com you go to the borrow aggregator you go to basic and then you say what kind of asset do you want to short or do you want to borrow in this case it's Dot and over here in the DJ protocols we can see that we can borrow dot tokens on the Venus protocol on moonwell on PR Prime on dforce on staray and on AP swap so fundamentally the way this works is you borrow the token you've got a loan denominated in that token and then you swap it against something that you're comparatively bullish on so in this case this would be for example ethereum then you wait for a while you wait for DOT to depreciate versus ethereum once you're happy with your gains you lock in those gains by swapping the ethereum back into Dot and you don't have to swap back everything because again dot depreciated versus ethereum the e that you have to swap back that's used for paying back the loan again the loan is denominated in Dot and the remainder that you've got left in ethereum that's then the pure profit if this went a bit over your head that's no problem right there are dedicated tutorial videos again on premium if you've got a crypto portfolio that's above $6,000 roughly then you should be able to make your money back simply just opening similar short positions that I have opened if your crypto portfolio isn't yet at $66,000 then there's also the free telegram so the link to the free telegram is as well down below looking very much forward to seeing you there that's 100% free cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz0SSpQCB9w,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Polkadot', 'JUST', 'Venus', 'WHY', 'dForce',

chance that December May outperform November for BTC and crypto prices at least that's according to the numbers here and the charts are objective the charts do not lie the Bull Run really is only just getting started and so in all likelihood we are going to have a strong December possibly one that outperforms November which of course is a good omen for altcoins so far right now and according to the metrics we're still seeing some pretty high BTC dominance but that being said there are some great altcoin projects that are starting to Make Some Noise some of them have started to go on runs already others it looks like have their runs lined up for the month of December and Beyond and that is exactly what we're considering in this video for spectacular altcoins whose fundamentals are very strong but who are just kind of starting to wake up now out of hibernation they're poed to have a terrific December and start to 2025 [Music] welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz all the very best of luck if you choose to invest whether that's into these projects that we're talking about today or any number of other altcoins that we discuss on this channel I wish you well but I'm not a financial or investment adviser just remember that as well as the fact that by extension this video is not official Financial or investment advice all right my first pick for today's altcoins that we're considering and perhaps surprisingly is Dogecoin ticker Doge do o g Dogecoin of course is a meme coin and uh it's certainly mem coin season right now nobody can deny that whatever way you look at it Dogecoin though is the king of the mem coins whatever you think of that space uh Dogecoin really is the Emperor of this Kingdom and Doge has a pretty long history it started all the way back in 2013 as a joke however it wasn't really until early April 2021 that it went parabolic it was dormant for a long time and then in late January 2021 one Doge was almost worth a cent a month later it was at 8 cents and then after that it went on the 4th of April from 5 Cent to 73 cents in a month that was on the 8th of May 2021 uh and right now we're sitting at just below 40s so it's on the way to a new all-time high with a little bit more of a push and if you think about it it was pretty hard to imagine back in 2013 that this joke of a project would have had this kind of success however in all fairness there's no Doge without Elon Musk uh and once he got involved as a personality really that's when Doge skyrocketed whenever he posts about Doge on X the price moves upwards correspondingly and then of course there's more to come with the new and upcoming Trump Administration Elon Musk will have a position there he's going to be leading as you probably know the department of government deficiency or Doge this surely is a reality that is stranger that fiction and the fact of the matter is it's not going to be all that surprising for Dogecoin to go even higher than its current 30 C mark it wouldn't surprise me at all to see new all-time highs later in the season and so with this in mind and with all that free attention that Dogecoin is receiving it wouldn't really surprise me at all to see Doge go higher than 40 cents and make its way up to and Beyond a new all-time high next up here and at number two it's been a while since we've talked about this one we're looking at Stacks ticker STX and as you may already know they are the leading Bitcoin layer 2 but one thing that you may not know uh is that it is one of the best wrapped Bitcoin products with its sbtc wrapped Bitcoin of course is a Hot Topic right now that's thanks to Justin's Sun's takeover of wbtc and the emergence of coinbase CB BTC sbtc is one to1 collateral like other rra tokens however the lack of a custodian is a huge and positive difference here between s sptc and other Solutions with sptc we don't have to wonder what Justin sun will do or if the custodian has all the collateral they claim they do with stacks and sbtc it's all transparent and right there for you to see plus it's all secured by bitcoin's hash rate not by some company's promises and anyone who runs a stack node can be a signer this ensures that sbtc stays decentralized and free of corruption this makes it the Market's most decentralized and disrupted wrapped BTC token and the lack of custodians makes sbtc the most censorship resistant wrapped Bitcoin available that's because sbtc actions take place on the Bitcoin blockchain sbtc is going multi-chain as well soon Zeus will offer sbtc on salana for of users who want programmable Bitcoin for defi also coming soon for sbtc is the full integration with coin flip this means that you're going to be able to withdraw sbtc from their ATMs all around the world when you need liquid cash or you can use the ATMs to buy your sbtc this is going to bring both sbtc and BTC availability to more people in more places sbtc is on the stacks test net now but main net is coming soon and here's that first deposit went with 15 Stacks signers notice at the bottom right you see a Bitcoin block transaction hash this transaction finalizes on the Bitcoin blockchain that's instead of in The Ledger of a custodian like Justin Suns bit Global none of the other popular rap tokens can offer that you can go give it a try or if you know you're ready to buy then go to curve that's where you can swap the sbtc wbtc pair today [Music] at number three here we are looking at cardano ticker Ada and this has been a hot one uh only a month ago we called out cardano and polad Dot as being dinosaurs uh which they are but look at what's happened since then Ada has had a 180% run over the last 30 days not in my wildest dreams uh could I have expected that but we've just been hit with the perfect storm of news for a legacy project like cardano and so here we are today Ada and a couple of other coins from the last Bull Run or other dinosaurs are making massive comebacks xrp dot sand super and a lot of others as well that are doing very very well and Ada even made it back into the top 10 as measured by crypto market cap its current price as I record sits at 97 cents with a 34 nearly $5 billion market cap and out of the 4 billion Ada we have 35 billion or about 80% in circulation and there is a major reason as to why Ada's current price is what it is why it's had the run that it's had on the 10th of November Charles hoskinson announced that he may get an advisory role to president Trump and just in case you don't know him hoskinson of course is the founder and CEO of cardano some are even speculating that hoskinson could find himself in the role of Secretary of the US Treasury I think that one a little bit far-fetched but uh it's been thrown out there as a suggestion at least I think what's much more likely and much more realistic but still fantastic uh would be a position on the newly formed crypto policy team and that would still be great that is already spectacular news my next altcoin pick here is radium last but not least here Ray is the ticker r a y it's a DEX on salana and in all fairness I don't mention radium all that often but uh it probably deserves to be looked at here it's had a very good run over these last 30 days with an uptick of about 64% however if we zoom out further over the course of a year Ray R ay is up 1327 per. but that being said if we zoom out further still uh if you can believe it it's still about 68% away from its all-time high that was in September of 2021 $16.83 whereas the current price of Ray right now is $537 Saul so is also on the rise and so is its ecosystem radium of course is a perfect example of this the predictions for Saul uh go all the way up to $1,000 which is about a 4X from here if that were to be the case I can also see a 4X or better for radium that would also mean a new alltime high radium is a solid amm automated Market maker that allows for fast and lowcost swaps it also provides various liquidity protocols it has a tvl of 2.3 billion do and with that figure it actually ranks in the third spot of all salana D Platforms in fact only goo and Jupiter have a higher tvl on salana you can also stake your ray r a y on radium and use its Bridge all to say that there's a lot to look forward to with this project uh if we extrapolate and look forward to the rest of this bull run okay set four projects here but we have a bonus at number five here in the form of polygon whose ticker is no ER madic it's now Paul p o and in 2022 and part of 2023 I really couldn't get polygon off the screen it established all kinds of new Partnerships it was especially known for that it also rolled out ZK evm and so it was doing great things in terms of these Partnerships uh they weren't just with anybody either they were topnotch uh featured major big Brands big corporations so the likes of mercedesbenz Twitter Starbucks meta Adidas Disney uh and a lot of others too was pretty intense and polygon ZK evm is a layer two scaling solution it uses zero knowledge or ZK proofs and offers low transaction costs however polygon despite all that good news faded a little bit uh however it seems to be working on a comeback right now the maic token ma atic peaked at almost $3 in December of 2021 however it then dropped to 32 cents in late October of this year since that time however it's up about 60% but in October of 2023 we saw the introduction of their new Paul P token you can use this token among all the polygon chains and Paul also saw a 60% increase over the last 30 days its current price is as I record 55 cents with a$ 4.47 billion market cap however in contrast to madic unfortunately Paul has an infinite token Supply this is not a good thing it's never a good tokenomics feature uh as far as projects go but if we can look beyond that there are certainly other positives and by that I mean that polygon is on the rise again so for example game seven Dow crowned polygon number one in gaming with the most titles across ecosystems we saw Solana make the comeback of a lifetime uh in the last couple of years now it's really teetering on new all-time highs polygon seems to be gearing up and some would say it has the same potential to do so let me know whether or not you agree with that Outlook in the comments comments

take advantage of the polygon metic decline because this is what we're looking at metic or P underperformed Bitcoin by more than 90% in the last 1 and A2 years now when a large cap cryptocurrency or a blue chip goes down by that much isn't that potentially a buying opportunity I'm not so sure because let's have a look at the market caps we talked about this before in Prior videos but I want to quickly reiterate there are now two meic tokens there is P with a market cap of 2.8 billion and there is the original meic token with a market cap of 1 billion so in total we're looking at 3.8 billion worth of meic tokens now the trading volume on the metic chain is only 134 million now the trading volume on the IC chain was only 134 million in the last 24 hours the relatively newly launched polygon ZK evm chain had less than 1 million of trading volume and that then compares to ton with 263 million and that's not even evm compatible and it also compares to arbitrum another layer two on top of ethereum with 441 million or check base base is almost at 1 billion of trading volume and so is it then Justified to to have such a market cap to have 3.8 billion I don't think so I think the floor is not yet in now the reason why the market is so bearish is not just the usage it's also the tokenomics with the introduction of P we now have an inflating token again and everybody thought that token inflation for metic is a thing of the past we didn't see any Supply expansion of metic since October of 2022 that has now changed with the merge to P now things are inflating again now how can we take advantage of that situation let's say we expect that the bearish momentum continues let's say nobody wants to buy meic how can we take advantage of course we can short the token the issue is that if crypto as a whole goes up then even the US dollar price of meic can go up as you have seen in the past have a look at this chart this starts in 2023 and this is the meic price relative to the US dollar and from October of 2023 to March of 2024 this went up by 150% you don't want to short a token that can go up that much temporarily now here's another meic chart also starting in 2023 now what's different between this chart and this chart it's the denominator here we look at us dollar but here we look at the Bitcoin denominated price here the same kind of rally is only 45% not 150% this is an effect we see across the board because crypto is highly correlated to one another and because when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well and vice versa we tend to see lower correlations in the Bitcoin denominator chart in other words we don't see this massive fluctuation and you don't want the price to fluctuate too much when shorting on a token right we cannot double and triple down on a position when we are short because the price could R for a very long time so low volatility is great for shorting or for betting on falling prices since beginning of the Year meic by the way underperformed Bitcoin by 76% now the problem is that not every centralized exchange allows for shorting meic relative to bitcoin it's always short posss relative to US dollar which are inherently more risky and so here's my contribution to the discussion to actually be productive and to not just bash on meic how can we make money from all of this the answer lies in decentralized finance in the a protocol so when you go to a that is a.com and you select the polygon blockchain and you can see there are several assets that we can supply and that we can borrow so this is a borrowing and lending platform we can supply collateral for example chain link tokens or usdc or tether or rep Bitcoin we can supply that and then with that collateral we can take out a loan denominated in another asset so this is how that works we are on the platform we click on Supply we ma that out so on this wallet that's less than a cent that we've got in reped Bitcoin we Supply the rep Bitcoin and and then with that collateral we can borrow now what we want to borrow is the asset that we are bearish on in this case the P token so we could borrow less than one cents worth of p in this example and what we are now doing is we are shorting the P token we are betting on the P token to do not that great we've got a loan denominated in P if now the value of P drops that's good because the value of our loan goes down now what we do next is we swap the P to something else right we've borrowed the P tokens now we want to swap this we don't want to hold that token we are bearish on the token we want to swap this into something that we believe will outperform P now this can be any asset you could swap this into anything else if you're swapping against usdc or usdt then you're opening a simple US dollar denominated short where you also have this risk that we talked about but when you swap this against reped ethereum or against reped Bitcoin then you have way less risk the volatility of that graph isn't that high once the swap is done everything is pretty much finished we can do one additional step but here's what happens let's say at the beginning of the year you borrowed $10,000 worth of p and you swapped this all directly against rep Bitcoin and then P loses against rep Bitcoin and in this case case that's 75% let's say you then wanted to take profit what happens because the p or the metic underperformed so much against Bitcoin and you're holding all of that Bitcoin from the swapping in order to buy the P back you have to now swap much less of the Bitcoin that you're holding right you only have to swap one quarter of the Bitcoin to get the same amount of P tokens and you have to pay back the loan in P only right the loan is denominated in p and so you're swapping back one quart of your Bitcoin the other three quarters is the profit that you keep you're buying back the p and then you pay back the loan so that's over here the repay button now why would you ever want to repay that loan it's to unlock your collateral again right you deposited collateral at the beginning to make this all work and in order to get this out again because those are basically the funds that get hold hostage you have to pay back all the loans and then withdraw now this was a short introduction into the topic shorting altcoins relative to other cryptocurrencies can be very very profitable and in premium I made many videos on the topic for example here how to win in bare markets by shorting alt coins it's a 42-minute video here's another one gaining from relative valuations 22 minutes another one how to profit from falling prices this shows the relationship between collateral and borrowed funds and health rates Etc we've also got a tutorial on how to back test shorting strategies and how to Beta adjust shorts because let's say the volatility of the two assets that you you go long versus short with are different let's say the thing you go short with is very very volatile and the thing that your long with is not that volatile then you should adjust the sizes so the volatile position should have less than the not so volatile position how that relationship should be is determined by the beta and how to calculate that beta is also explained in this video so things get very complex there's false shorting as well that doesn't have price exposure there is hundreds of tutorial videos in premium feel free to check it out down the Bitcoin stay.com there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see then simply just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% of course besides the tutorials there's also a community that's in telegram where we discuss potential short opportunities but that's not enough about premium again I publish videos on various alt coins including metic regularly on this channel so feel you to subscribe and of course see you next time

everybody is looking at the cryptocurrencies that are currently high that get hyped up but nobody looks at the ones that might be a good deal let's have a look at cardano it seems like the relative valuations of cardano bring a very nice risk to reward and what's especially interesting for Ada is that the relative valuations to bitcoin ethereum to the entire crypto space as a part of the altcoins when you look at all of those relative valuation starts the risks tends to align at around 30% but the reward could be multiple xes now let's first start with the ugly let's have a look at the total value locked as in how much capital is currently on the cardano Chain this is unfortunately not growing very consistently right we had our pumps and dumps and pumps and dumps and currently there is no real growth a lot of this ups and downs is caused by the cardano price itself because when we look at the total value locked measured in Ada tokens we simply just go sideways right now again no growth but the capital is also not flowing out let's have a look at those fascinating relative valuation charts let's start off simply with the US dollar valuation of ADA so here is what could potentially be an obvious support at roughly 24 cents and from the current price down to that level we see a drop of roughly 33% so that's the potential risk now what's the potential upside maybe more than an 8X more than 700% but things start to become really interesting once we look at relative valuation charts because cardano seems to be trading in a somewhat predictable range this is Ada relative to bitcoin and it bottomed out at very similar levels in the past it also topped out at similar levels the tops don't align perfectly but still we can see where the air is getting somewhat thinner this chart starts in October of 2017 by the way this is a very long-term chart and relative to bitcoin cardano could lose another 30% roughly but it could gain another almost 900% and here's the thing it's not just the chart relative to bitcoin that looks pretty enticing here's cardano relative to ethereum granted the potential risk here is a bit higher we could drop by 40% or maybe even 50% relative to ethereum the upside isn't as large it's maybe 600% the current momentum overall isn't too great either so this is the least bullish of the charts what's interesting with the ethereum denominated chart relative to the Bitcoin chart is that here the two tops T to align pretty well for Bitcoin the tops didn't align that well here we've got the kadano dominance chart here it's two different tops that align pretty well and cardano dominance is simply just a measure of how much market cap is current in Ada relative to the entire crypto space so how much of all of crypto is currently in kadano and that's currently 0.6% and in its top it's around 4.6% what's the risk over here you guessed it it's roughly 33% what's the potential reward it's more than a 7x here's the problem with crypto YouTube people promoting becoming dgen or buying 100 x coins that's what gives clicks but that's not what's going to bring you forward I refuse to take money from centralized exchanges I refuse to take money from crypto projects I refuse to pump and dump a coin and filling up my pockets in the background I don't do any of this instead I share my knowledge in the form of tutorials in the premium membership so that's content that won't do well on YouTube but that builds up skill over time you can also directly contact me over there you can directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com is the link now we've just looked at the kadano dominance right how much of all of market cap is in cadano relative to all of crypto but what about kadano relative only to the other altcoins so what happens once we exclude Bitcoin and ethereum from that total the answer is over here and I believe this is the best of the charts and the reason why I think it's the best is because here the tops tend to align the best how much could cardano under under perform relative to other alt coins again you guessed it 33% the potential outperformance by the way is roughly 500% a bit less than that crypto is a game of buying low and selling high it's a game of buying things most people aren't looking at cardano is obviously low right now but unfortunately on chain we don't have a lot of adoption either it would have been nice to see that the total value locked at least measured in Ada goes up over time on chain it's it's not what we are seeing a speculation on buying this bottom is simply just hoping that some kind of excitement could revive again I don't have a crystal ball either I don't know where the kadano price will go but I believe that the risk at least relative to bitcoin and ethereum is somewhat limited there might be upside but for that we need a new story the downside is probably not that bad and in the end that's what it's all about right it's trying to get the odds in our favor nobody knows where things will go but if you can get the probabilities somewhat right if you can get the downside lower than the upside we might have some potential at our hands I personally do not hold any cardano right now but I am planning to dollar cost average in a little bit over the next months again just hoping for the upside if the support levels break if we fall more than 30% relative to Bitcoin in ethereum then I'm out as well but if the support can hold then probably the price will outperform for again in the next Bull Run if it's

Meme Coin Breakthrough Will These Tokens Skyrocket #trading #btc #spy #top,join our private in bio,and more importantly they have got huge amounts of holders in a very short period of time and that way it could potentially get listed on some major exchanges and if it does get listed on some major exchanges it could even run much much higher so very much a coin I am also very excited about sitting around $200 million in market cap this is most likely going to be pushing up much much higher and for most of these meme coins guys if you're just looking at Price targets for Brett I think 10 billion is possible if it gets listed on coinbase for slurf a billion is defin easily possible for bu cat also I think a billion is definitely possible and the community is really thinking it is going to hit a billion dollars because a billion dollars is basically $1 in terms of hash buat so yeah really a thing I'm looking forward towards that is going to be playing out in this market,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdXmb9sTMwI,['JUST'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xdXmb9sTMwI/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-30T15:01:08Z

cap so we have got positive momentum potential upside let's have a look at the blockchain analytics let's see who's buying and selling here and how solid this really actually is so we're currently at a price of 30 2207 the price went up by 176% in the last month alone and the rally seems to be pretty stable right we are climbing with not that much volatility at least recently of course we did see our bearish times as well now let's figure out who dumped the price before let's have a look at the number of holders over time let's figure out what retail is doing versus what the whales are doing so we've got almost 177,000 holders on chain and the largest of the holders tends to accumulate over time this is good now on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 4.5 million hoppy tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 wor worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's now $10,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we see how small retail continues to accumulate we also see how mediumsized retail continues to accumulate only the whales the very very large wallets don't really change in numbers now let's zoom into the blockchain details of just the last month where we got our almost 3x return here are the same kind of charts with the same kind of thresholds but only only for the last month again retail is accumulating very very constantly the number of retail investors grew by roughly 15% or so then there's mediumsized retail That Grew by roughly 5% and then we've got the whales a very slight change of a decline of two wallets now why am I talking about hoppy on this channel it's because it's in that sweet spot it's not that small and it hasn't just launched yesterday it's going to rock pull tomorrow but it's also not that big that there's no more upside potential when we buy meme coins we want to get multiple X returns we don't just want to have 5 or 10% returns and so here is how hoppy faes relatively speaking this is the trending tokens on ethereum and hoppy is the 19th largest in terms of liquidity in terms of trading volume in the last 24 hours it's at rank 15 yet the market cap is only at 94 million now let's have a look at how we can potentially time this token how can we buy and sell in general I'm a fan of buying tokens that have a growing investor base where a lot of new investors come into the token because the more new people are in the higher the price can sustainably go now what we've got over here is the number of new users in purple and the number of returning users in Orange on the left side we've just got this numerically on the right side we've got this normalized to 100% now what's interesting here is the 10th of October the number of new users really went up quite a bit and those are the kind of data points I like those are the kind of data points that potentially precede price relies let's have a look at that 10th of October it was pretty much the bottom and subsequently we've seen a rally of more than 100% now unfortunately we don't see a lot of new users today but still it very much makes sense to look at this metric regularly now those charts come from a tour that I've developed myself you can plug in any ethereum token into this tool it's part of Premium link is down below the Bitcoin str.com but there's also potentially something to worry about for hoppy and that's its current attention whenever attention spikes it tends to be a bad time to buy have a look at this the 6th of July a lot of buyers a lot of sellers a lot of attention here's the 6th of July on the price chart it was the absolute tippy top and subsequently we saw our draw down of almost 80% the hoppy token is not necessarily at bottom attention it's not as high as it used to be but still it's not at the bottom so this could be not that great again this needs to be closely monitored when this turns around it's a bad idea to keep holding let's say you would have monitored the number of daily buyers in July and then you decided say on the 13th of July or so that we peaked in attention this would have saved you from a subsequent decline of more than 60% now analyzing tokens and trying to find entry and exit points is always good it's always nice to use us onchain tools but the question is always what's the interesting token to buy in the first place and for that I prefer wallet tracking I like to look at wallets of influencers that might promote a coin afterwards or at least that tend to have a good win rate in the past and so here's again something from premium we've got our influencer trade Channel and here's a free Little Nugget that I want to share influencer Kyle chesse just bought the ndx token which is a meme coin that Rives the wave of SPX 16900 we also talked about SPX 16900 very early on this channel here is that influencer Kai chesse 133,000 subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets we've got 419 wallets in total and so of course I also share my trades with premium members and for your information I have already bought that token as well so be aware of the potential conflict of interest here right if you now buy after me the price goes up why I'm holding if I then sell before you sell I make money off of you this is where the ndx token is currently at we bought over here we got our signal over here we obviously at an all-time high so we un profit and the reason why I like the token is so much because the market cap is still just at 19 million so it's still another four to 5x until we are at levels of hoppy and so if you actively trade meme coins and you've got the impression that you still come very late to the party again feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com there's also a 7-Day money back guarant so in case you don't like what you get over there simply message me within the first 7 days I refund you 100% no questions asked so again to summarize Hoy it seems like attention currently is very high we do not see a lot of new investors in the last few days it seems like things could be somewhat heated it doesn't mean that the price can't go higher but it does mean that at least a stop loss is warranted it's very much possible that the price crashes another 50% you don't want to be involved during that crash if

Price Prediction, BTT longterm, BTT Tokenomics,  #bittorrent #btt #crypto","8 months ago I made a video on the BT token on bit torrent and it was one of the most successful videos on this channel it almost made 400 subscribers and still up to this day it gets traffic at the time the price was highly manipulated the vertical line is when the video was published and the price pumped from bottom to top by almost 200% now since we are down low again does it make sense to buy and hope for the next pump let's have a look at a few fundamentals let's have a look at how much the BTT network is being used how much it's used for bridging how much is used for transactions let's dive into the toomics let's dive into the accumulation by retail investors versus whale investors let's have a look at the data most people are not considering so this is what everybody is looking at this is the website of bit torrent connecting all chains and it allows to bridge assets across various chains in this video though we want to look at potential price developments so there's a staking program for BTT that currently earns 177% apy and we can already see how much the centralized exchanges are involved in this most staking happens through binance now it's very hard to find proper data around the toomics of bit Torin there's M.O and that shows us some circulating Supply numbers but it all doesn't really add up because the inflation here is only 1.8% in the last year while again the Stak King almost returns 10 times of that let's have a look at a few fundamentals is there a lot of development happening are there a lot of code changes happening what's up with the white paper so first let's have a look at GitHub this is the place where programmers submit their code changes to a project and for the midor project we don't see that much activity unfortunately a change here 5 days ago another one 3 weeks ago more 3 weeks ago some even two months ago so really just looking at that data it looks almost like a dead project the white paper had been published more than 5 years ago and here we've got something around token issuance a total supply of almost 1 trillion it looks like almost all of that is already circulating and have a look at who got those tokens there was a public sale of 6% a private sale of 2% a seed sale of 9% so that's in total 177% then we've got airdrops which are 20% of the supply and the remaining roughly 60% a bit more than 60% seem to be going to insiders so the torrent team the Tron Foundation the bit torrent ecosystem and 4% to Partners whatever that means and so there's three different kinds of tokens the majority is on the Tron chain then we've got also some tokens on ethereum and also a bunch of tokens on the binance smart chain on Tron 87% of all of Supply is held by only 10 holders in total we've got 237,000 holders on ethereum there's less than one tenth of that and on the binance smart chain there's roughly double of what there is on ethereum let's have a look at the pace of accumulation by both retail investors as well as whale investors I built a tool for ethereum and the binance smart chain where you can actually dive into the number of retail investors versus whale investors let's have a look so here we go this is the ethereum chain on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold roughly 135 million tokens and that's worth to $100 worth of the token in the middle we go 10x on that that's a minimum holding of $11,000 on the right we go to $10,000 minimum holding there's accumulation across small retail and medium-sized retail the quote unquote Wales with $10,000 worth of the token is not growing in numbers here are the same charts for the binance smart chain so here we've got higher numbers we also see accumulation across the board the Wales stopped though in the last years and here's again the direct comparison between the two now there is a change and that's roughly in the last 5 months or so there isn't any accumulation anymore both on ethereum but also on the binance smart chain so something has happened with retail demand March of this year is roughly around here and by the way this is the BTT token divided by ethereum and since then since retail isn't buying anymore BTT underperformed ethereum by roughly 45 5% again I believe that this R was mainly manipulation it was not driven by any fundamental reasons more on that is in the prior BTT video on this channel right so feel free to check it out in case you haven't watched it yet let's check out the usage right because BTT is its own chain what we've got over here is the number of daily transactions and that's currently fluctuating around 50,000 or so here we've got the number of verified contracts per day sometimes this is at zero so there not a single smart contract that's deployed and verified for several months in a row and here we've got the number of deployed contracts this is above zero because those contracts are not verified this can have many reasons it could be smart contracts that are used for Arbitrage trading it could be smart contracts that can't be properly verified because it's scam tokens who knows whatever those deployments are they unlikely organic adoption by retail or by proper projects moving to BTT there used to be a little bit of action on the Chain so check this out this is defi Lama this is the bit torrent chain total value locked over time and at one point we had been even above 15 million but this all came crashing down now we are at only a little bit above 200,000 and that's for a network with a fully diluted market cap of 700 million now here is why BTT is so easy to manipulate there's very little liquidity on chain there's only 380,000 on ethereum and a bit under $200,000 on the binance smart chain and again most tokens are on Tron and a lot of that is held directly by binance or by bitum by the centralized exchanges and so that's then how that looks like BTT can be bought on binance and of course also on Justin Suns htx so htx is very closely affiliated with Tron there was $1.5 million of wash trading on a HDX in the last 24 hours while on chain there was less than $4,000 worth of trading it's even more extreme on the piture Futures Market here we've got in some roughly $5 million worth of wash trading and so since BTT is now low relatively speaking doesn't make sense to buy low and sell High I wouldn't hold my breath it's very intransparent who still owns the token and who's taking profit when there's no manipulation we can easily go down by 72% relatively speaking in the span of a bit over a year and so yes you could dollar cost average into Infinity buy more and more every month just to hope for this one pump that might or might not happen but that's definitely a gamble because I do believe longterm it's very likely that the fundamentals are going to catch up and thus the price might simply just continue on its merry way down again it's $200,000 of total value locked at a valuation of more than 700 million and so so instead of trying to find this one altcoin that might do well I simply short very bad altcoins they altcoins that have way more token inflation where the token inflation is very transparent and where we see the underperformance also very transparently for example this token over here I'm shorting this already for a very long time since beginning of the year this already underperformed by more than 60% I made money with that underperformance and I'm continue to make money with this if you also want to bet on

Token Tokenomics,  #basicattentiontoken #Bat #crypto","bat the basic attention token is on a massive rally and the question is what's going on here who's buying who selling what's happening let's have a look at some fundamentals let's also have a look at onchain analytics to go beyond the price action because in the end the fundamental question is does it still make sense to buy bet is there still some upside potential or is this a short-term pump and dump now the basic attention token is the token issued by the brave browser team it's the leading browser that focuses on privacy and that focuses on crypto and the adoption of the Brave browser has been growing over time and so today the price of bat is at 28 C it's up 36% this week this month it appreciated by 73% but we did see way larger relies in the past with subsequent dumps so we do see that the price is not necessarily one-on-one correlated to the popularity of the browser now here is what's very important when investing in any altcoin when we buy an altcoin we take on more risk compared to just buying Bitcoin in other words if we take on that additional risk we also should get more compensation for that risk right why would we increase our risk if we don't get more return thus I believe it's more important than looking at US dollar prices to actually look at relative valuation prices did an altcoin outperform Bitcoin because if the answer is no then at least in the past it wasn't necessarily the best investment and so unfortunately that's true for the basic attention token this is BET divide Ed by Bitcoin and the chart starts in May of 2019 and bat underperformed Bitcoin by more than 93% and yes we are in a rally recently but that rally is somewhat of a blip in the marathon of Prior suffering but let's have a look at what drove this price decline and let's try to figure out if this small rally here is the beginning of a turnaround to get a bit more details let's have a look at the onchain analytics so let's look at the buyers and sellers let's look at transaction data now the first piece of information we have is the number of holders we've got 443,000 holders of bat on the ethereum chain and we can see that with this current rally a lot of new wallets buy the token so what we're seeing here on the left is the number of new users per day in the last month and we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over I would not be surprised if today is even higher than what we've seen yesterday now on the right side we see the relationship of new users versus return in users per day so now we normalize to 100% this is how it looks like on the left when we add the returning users in other words most of Trading still happens by existing wallets potentially even automated trading potentially even bot trading now what we've got over here are three charts that I look at for pretty much any token that's discussed on this channel and that's the number of retail investors versus the number of whale investors on chain and the way this segmentation is done is through minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 3,000 bet tokens now at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 and that's what I consider retail now in the middle we've got mediumsized holder so that's now 3,000 tokens minimum holding on the right side another 10x so 30,000 tokens now for the chart in the middle we go a 10x in minimum holding compared to the left so that's now 30,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right side another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we can observe that there was a peak in the number of retail holders in November of 2020 we see that Peak a bit earlier for medium-sized retail in April of 2020 already and for the Wales interestingly enough they continued accumulating longer up until January of 2022 so retail tended to offload for a long time the whales tended to buy up until a point but they have stopped those purchases as well afterwards and again those are very long-term charts the number of all holder segments are going down for the last 3 years roughly and so let's see what's going on in the last month again we went up in the price by 73% do we also see accumulation at least shortterm the answer is unfortunately no the number of retail wallets went down by roughly 200 medium-sized retail stayed flat and so that the number of whale investors and so the only thing we can actually see is that there's more activity so the existing Traders trading more among themselves there are more buyers and sellers recently it's not comparable to what we have seen during the bull market in 2019 2020 but we are picking up just a little bit and so that raises quite a few question marks right how can a price go up by More than 70% in a month when the number of holders on chain tends to go down when people tend to rather exit the token I believe the answer lies in Market manipulation it lies in Market making it lies in the people that own most of the token and the market makers of course have a lot of bet and the trading doesn't happen necessarily onchain anymore it mainly happens now offchain it happens in the centralized exchanges the black boxes where we can't look at the actual data so check this out most trading volume happens on binance but it's actually not those 16% that are moving the price I believe it's the bets on the price the lever instruments the derivatives that move everything we've got binance here again with 64% trading volume so 93 million but we've got tool bit Futures as well now what on Earth is tool bit this is the tool bit centralized exchange and I believe this is simply a white labeled binance maybe for a market where binance is not allowed because just have a look at how similar those websites look we've got a magnifying glass we've got a login a sign up a download button and our language selector the download button shows a QR code and here we've got binance the exact same setup also with a QR code over here for downloading so this is simply just another front end for the same thing that happens under the hood so really binance is moving almost 200 million worth of of trading volume in the last 24 hours now don't get me wrong the BET US dollar price can still go up but that's probably not necessarily idiosyncratically to the BET token or to the brave browser it's mainly because crypto itself is expanding because what we see over here is the stable coin market cap over time the chart starts in 2022 and with the collapse of teral Luna and the anchor protocol and when us depa we started a contraction of the market we saw how the bare Market started and how a lot of prices went down this then turned around at the beginning of October of last year since then the stable coin market cap is going up and that's recently even accelerating and so this is how that works right when you send your hard-earned fiat currency to a centralized exchange that centralized exchange sendes over to a stable coin issuer that stable coin issuer hopefully holds those funds in a safe account and then issues or mins the tokens on the chain and what happens on chain we can see over here in this chart so when this is going up more stable coins get min because more Fiat is flowing into crypto when this is going down then people are withdrawing from crypto they pull out their fiat currency and so when money flows into the crypto sector of course all kinds of assets can go up because there is correlation right correlation looks like this everything is green but the risk to reward is not necessarily the same for all of those tokens I still believe though that the best risk to reward is still in the meme coins it's in the smaller cap meme coins have a look at those performances here we saw big doc think going up by 67% in the last week or lucky coin by more than 400% bully by almost 300% Etc you get the gist right most of those performances are in the market caps of hundreds of millions not in the billions the big question always is how can we get one of those outperformers early right how can we spot a small altcoin that has the potential to 3 four 5x in a single week my answer to this is the following it's shown over here on the screen it's wallet tracking so I like to track the wallet of influential people of top traders of people that move markets of influencers I like to look at what are they buying and what are they selling and for example over here two days ago we had the martini guy that bought the moon token and that was directly on pump. fund so that was the Solana blockchain and he bought this for 412 and we then of course discussed this at length but have a look at what happened to the Token it made a massive massive runup more than 1,000% Then Came Crashing Down no surprise here but have a look at the current price it's currently at 493 so even after this massive collapse the price is still up by 8X or so that's how early some of those signals can be right how else can we find tokens like this that shwed up like that this was literally a 100x since the signal now here is the guy that we are tracking here this is the martini guy he's got 149,000 subscribers and of course when he talks about a token that token can generate some attention and the price tends to go up and so here's the Magic in all of this through onchain analytics we found various of his wallets and ret track his wallets we've got 12 of his wallets in total finding those wallets is the actual art of the game now not all of those signals go up that much that quickly but still have a look at this this is Alex Becker he bought the Spectra token at $238 and again that was just a bit over 24 hours ago that's up now 14% And probably you know Alex Becker he's got 1.5 million subscribers the reason probably why the token didn't go up much more yet is because he hasn't published a video on the token yet at least he didn't promote it recently here are the wallets that we Track by Alex Becker we've got 12 in total but there's also a way to get these kind of tokens even earlier to follow influencers that are a bit more risky in their approach for example here we've got crypto gains that bought Spectre already at 16 cents so that was way way back in the day it was over here since then we are up more than 1,500% and so here's crypto game he's also got a bit over 100,000 followers so again when he talks about especially the smaller tokens they can get quite a bit of momentum we do have a few more of his wallets he tends to change wallets quite often we've got 55 that we are tracking in total by the way we track more than 400 wallets and so really this is I believe where the real Alpha is it's not buying those large cap cryptocurrencies with billions and billions of dollars it's buying the small ones but doing it smartly not just picking something randomly in a list it's following the smart money it's following the people that tend to make very profitable trades and thus get very similar returns to them and so I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic so this is eight videos in total how can we find influencer wallets how can we track those influencer wallets and how can we interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about back testing it's about portfolio diversification and risk management there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we have got a wallet signal we also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we also have to compare our on analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first week and I refund to you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so is 28 cents the ceiling for the BET token I don't think so I think it will go up together with the rest of the market but will it long-term outperform Bitcoin probably not I think the best risk reward is really in the smaller tokens if you got some value this video feel you to subscribe I publish vide regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2wDf1wwdj4,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Safe', 'JUST',

#cryptotrading #bybit #OKX #bitcoinholders","meme coins are exploding guys altcoins are exploding as well and in today's video I want to bring you five altcoins which I am looking at investing heavy in not only have I been investing in them but I'm also doubling down and investing even more in the coming months and weeks and I think they're going to do very very well of course guys with mean coins we see a lot of inherit risk and of course the risk sometimes is much less than the potential reward which it can pay off however of course mean coins are risky I can't make this video with without telling you that Meme coins are risky everybody knows it but in today's video guys I want to talk about some meme coins which could absolutely do really really well a couple of them are literally ready and waiting to break out any week now any day now so I really want to get you to this video I've got a couple of low market cap meme coins a couple of big big market market cap meme coins and overall you've probably heard of most of them however these are just ones that I'm putting myself in big positions in because I think they could do very very well so guys first of all let's talk about about the Bitcoin dominance because the Bitcoin dominance has been absolutely going crazy over the past few years and this is almost a 2year rising wedge however like all great things they have to come to an end unfortunately a little bit like some holidays however we could be seeing a massive breakdown from the Bitcoin dominance in the coming weeks what does this mean money is going going to be flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins into meme coins and I think this cycle could even be a little bit different we could be seeing money coming into into mem coins before going into certain altcoins because everybody knows mem coins have been outperforming altcoins and mostly Bitcoin in the short term so people are very very interested so the first one which I want to talk about of course it's the best one it's Dogecoin and I think a lot of you already know what it is what it does I mean it's a meme coin it doesn't really do much however it's very very cool of course you know supported by Elon Musk that's probably the biggest reason about how you know it but we can see that of course it's got a massive massive following on Twitter and I promise guys there's going to be more meme coins not just Dogecoin in this video so definitely stick around when we start to go ahead and take a look at the chart though this is where it starts to get very very interesting because right now I am on the weekly chart and although Dogecoin has had an absolutely massive pump to the upside I mean look at this right here it's absolute vertical growth right there I mean we can track it right here from the bottom it's up at the peak 400% in the space of Just 2 and 1 half months that is incredible right now we are coming to this level on the um Fibonacci Fibonacci so look at that it entered the golden pocket right there the 65618 it entered there just a little bit it nicked into it and wicked down back back down below I believe in the coming weeks we are going to see Dogecoin go back up and retest this level right here this golden pocket right there which from this current price level would be around about depending on how you look at it a 15 to 20% gain and of course if you wanted to trade that it is possible I will tell you about that in just a second second but on the shorter term if we take a look at Dogecoin it's looking pretty good to be honest we can see right here it's looking fairly fairly parabolic to be honest I mean it's having a nice upwards Bend upwards curve C catching the different levels of support right here and right here most likely we'll see another break before retest before a further break and potentially getting back into this golden pocket right here which would be very very nice overall I'm very bullish on Dogecoin I think it will do well I've got a a reasonable amount of it and I will be buying more if you wanted to go ahead and trade Dodge Coin of course many people right now are using leverage to trade I've been using it for the past 6 years to trade crypto to trade altcoins if you have for example $1,000 in Dogecoin and you think I'm missing out it's not enough you can go ahead to an exchange like bit X and go ahead and open a Futures position or a long position with a very very small of amount of Leverage for example 2x 3x so rather than just having $1,000 you're going to have two three or $5,000 and if you plan it so your stop loss or your liquidation price is not going to get hit you can go ahead and ride out and have a bigger amount of capital for the bull market of course guys I wouldn't be bringing you Bion X unless they had an amazing bonus and right now until the 13th of the December there is absolutely an amazing bonus going on you can deposit a th000 get 200 back deposit 500 get 100 back deposit 200 get 40 back it's an amazing opportunity all you need is your name and the email no kyc no documentation nothing it's bringing crypto and the power back to the people without letting the government's knowing what you're trading because of course you don't want to let them know what your mean coin profits are that is for sure the next one which I want to talk about guys is Axel now Axel is on the sui chain and if you are a big believer of sui I mean we can see right here if we go down here to to sui it's been absolutely exploding over the past uh few weeks and months we don't I don't even have to tell you this probably because you can see right here just in the past um 2 and a half months it's up over 400% similar to Doge and it's been exploding and I think potentially axol could be one of the main narratives on this chain on sui chain for meme coins of course as you know if you do go ahead and get a main narrative coin or the main coin on that chain you're going to make a shedload of money and I'm betting big on this one guys I really really think it could do well it's been struggling recently to get to keep above and stay above 20 million market cap but in my opinion that is good because it's showing a lower market cap more opportunity rather than buying something with a 7 billion market cap the growth is not going to be as much as buying something with a lower market cap of course there is inherent risk with buying this it may not become the main CH the main meme coin on the Chain it may not do amazing I can't tell you if it's going to or not however this is crypto there is a little bit of a risk or there's a lot of elevant or risk and I am taking a risk on Axel you can go ahead and follow them over on Twitter as well the Twitter account is growing very nicely they're posting very cool stuff and I think over overall axar will do well if we take a look at it on the chart of course it's not not really been launched too uh too long now so we can't really understand too much from the price analysis but I have pulled out a little bit of something for you on the technical analysis front so we can see right here most likely it is going to be forming this triangle pattern right there with a break towards the upside and if we take a look at the measured move right here for the potential break we can see that depending on where it breaks out we could be reaching up to around 3 3.2 C and again from those price levels or from the current price levels that's a massive gain of around 75% that could be coming to Axel and if it does better of course if it becomes a native mem coin on Su chain it will do even better than that the next one which I want to talk about is book of meme currently ranked 131 with a market cap of $634 million I think this one is looking very very nice mainly because of a technical standpoint when we take a look at the chart in a second I'll show you but it's looking really really nice from that technical standpoint and again we can see that on the chart right here if we go to Bone right there we can see that it's doing really really well we can see that it is actually if we take a zoom out on the 3-day or even on the daily chart I guess we can see that it's in this triangle formation right here and this I believe it's forming into some form of a falling wedge right here a little bit and it could be looking like it's going to have a nice move and a nice push up to this area right there again and we take a look at that in a percentage terms from the current price anywhere from 70 to 80 to 90% depending on where but I think it really could be pushing up to this 2cent um 2cent margin uh up here I really do think it can and again if you're trading that on something like uh Bin x with um around a 2 to three or 4X leverage if you get a good entry P price for example you could potentially get an an entry price with a liquidation uh a liquidation price probably 20 30% down here and honestly I don't think it's going to go back down here I mean if you're trading it low enough on a 2X leverage you could probably get a liquidation price below the bottom like the actual bottom so I don't think it's going to go down there so again very very nice interesting potential trades the next one which I want to talk about of course is Brett pretty much the biggest chain or the biggest meme coin on the coinbase base chain I think it's going to do really really well I was in I was in Brett at about 35 to 40 million I made a bit of money on it however I think it's going to do really really well this Market if we do see an air drop from the base chain bread is going to explode even more and I think already it's at all-time highs and already it's going to do very very well we can see here on social media massive following of around 135k I think it's going to do great if we take a look at some price analysis on Brett we can pull it up right here we can see that on the three-day or on the on the daily chart we've in fact broken have we broken alltime high no almost broken alltime high and now currently we are in this potential falling wedge uh situation or this descending channel right here which we usually see a break towards the upside retesting that all-time high and again breaking it I think Brett is going to be very very bullish this PO Market guys and if you have got a bag of Bret let me know down below CU I would love to know your thoughts if you think it will do well the next one which I think is going to do well guys you all know it is called Pepe of course you know it uh and this is a massive massive meme coin I mean we can see over on Twitter over 700,000 followers it's got an amazing following the market cap 2.2 billion and I think comp comp to dogecoins market cap at 4.2 billion I think Pepe has a good chance of at least doing a two three maybe even a 4X this bull market when we pull up the price and take a look at the chart it's starting to look very very nice again like a lot of like a lot of mem coins they've had a big pump now they're consolidating into a pattern before potentially seeing a further break towards the upside and pepe is no danger in no stranger to that again alltime highs were reached very very recently we saw a massive pump here of about 235% in just 11 days I think it could potentially come further it could potentially come further down and find this level of support for example right here we have this falling wedge right here it could potentially find the support and then see a break towards the upside again it's a good project and I think it could potentially do well and guys I'm always updating people on my Twitter with different charts for example right here is the C chart right there if you just scroll down uh we can see the W chart right there we can see ethereum we can see strrt we can see Manta there's so many we can see bone right there I actually posted this analysis right there see so many different things if you go ahead and follow me on Twitter so I really do recommend that and again guys don't forget to go ahead and get your bonus for bitching X if you want to trade without kyc without restrictions without giving your passport without giving your utility bills or proof of residence Bon X is the place to make your profits this bull market without anybody knowing and you didn't hear that from me so go

last month let's have a look at who's buying here who's selling here how much longer this R can potentially last so this is Dex screener this is ordered by liquidity we've got 140 million in the aot token that's even more than the coinbase wrapped Bitcoin and there's a reason why the asset has grown that much this is a total value lock of the aerodome decentralized exchange it's currently at 1.1 billion while the fully diluted market cap is at 1.5 billion that seems like a pretty good deal right if the total value lock increases the price will likely increase as well with the market cap but let's have a look at comparisons how well does this metric work is there some kind of a fixed ratio between the market cap of a project and its total value locked or its capital that it's handling on chain let's have a look at Unis swap uni swap has a total value locked of roughly 4.8 billion and its fully diluted market cap is at 7.6 billion so almost double of the total value locked so does that mean to get some kind of fair valuation the arrow price should double as well not so quick unfortunately it is not that easy because let's have a look at the leading decentralized exchange on the binance smart chain pancake swap that's got a total value locked of 2.8 billion and here the fully diluted market cap is roughly half of that total value locked at 0.9 billion so the fully diluted market cap can be double of its total value locked as with Unis swap it can be close to the total value locked as with arrow or it can be half of the total value locked as with pancake swap there is no Clear Connection here things like toomics things like the current Narrative of the day do matter and a lot of people want to bet on the base chain right the base chain is growing quite a bit and since there is no native token for base people simply just buy arrows the largest of the decentralized exchanges now let's have a look at the holders of Arrow who's currently buying who's selling in total we've got 192,000 holders on chain but not all of those holders have a lot of capital in this let's look at some minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 5,000 arot tokens so at the current price that's maybe $6,000 or so that's growing quite constantly over time and is currently at 3,00 700 so roughly 1.5% of the holders in other words 85.5% of holders on chain have less than5 or $6,000 worth of the token most are just in it with play money now in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding compared to the left chart so that's now 50,000 tokens or $60,000 and on right we go another 10x so that's now more than half a million dollar worth of the token this is the real Mega Wales and they're currently roughly 100 such wallets the main problem with crypto YouTube is conflict of interest too many YouTubers shill garbage promote garbage and fill up their pockets in the background not this channel instead there's simply the offer where I share my skills my perspectives to you and where I also share direct access to me where you can ask me any questions feel free to check it out the premium membership link is down below now here's something to think about all wallet cohorts are accumulating right there are more more whales there's more more retail investors so why do we see the following why do we see the price sometimes dumping that much from more than $2 all the way down to below 50 this doesn't seem to be a mass Exodus of investors right the number of investors is growing and when we look at the last month where the price of Arrow doubled the number of holders didn't really double so the number of retail investors on chain grew by less than 10% there seems to be some kind of artificial price Discovery here and toen allocations aren't necessarily 100% transparent so we've got the funding through the base ecosystem fund that was undisclosed in its size we've got a token distribution that's not really self-explanatory there seems to be quite a lot of Insider allocation as well and on top of that we've got of course also token inflation because if we use the aerodrome platform we get incentive tokens as well that we can by the way also lock up so here's the emission schedule over time here's a different repes presentation of the same emission schedule and what's interesting about this is that this is assuming that some of the emissions get locked up in other words there's actually more inflation but this is assuming that not all of this hits the market and so it seems to make sense when investing into Arrow to not just hold the token but to actually stake it to actually get some rewards because if you're using Arrow relay you're close to all-time highs when adding the price plus the yield when we just look at the price we're very far away from the alltime high high now here's something that's depressing the price we do see how a lot of people lock up the arrow so that's an average a bit under 4 years lock up period but we also see how the percent of aor Supply that's locked tends to decline over time and that's of course also depressing the price when there are token unlocks and those unlocks get sold that of course pushes prices down that happened actually with the pancake swap token pancake swap had a staking program introduced a oneyear lockup period if you locked up your cake and waited for a year you got 80% more cake one year after that initiation of the program the cake price completely collapsed so it definitely makes sense to get out of Arrow before the lock up expires but again we can see how it already is expiring somewhat gradually right the percent that's locked up is declining now the fundamental question to all of this is of course usage right when a decentralized exchange gets used more and more and generates more and more fees due to swapping activities then of course emissions don't really matter too much we do see how the base chain is growing in total value locked do we also see how trading activity on Aerodrome is rising the answer is over here on the left side we've got the transaction count over time so a very nice Spike at the end of March of this year this is where a lot of meme coin trading happened now we tend to revive against somewhat but what's interesting is that this is mainly the transaction count it's not the trade account so the trade account is still relatively low so something is artificially inflating the trading I'm not sure if there's more Arbitrage spots now active on Aerodrome I'm not sure what's exactly going on but it's not necessarily just new people coming in it seems like this current rally is not underpinned by sufficient holder growth we do however see a positive trend longterm the question is if toomics are hostile enough to let the price correct yet again by another 75% is the aot token cheap or is it expensive it of course depends on what you measure this against against pancake swap is expensive against Unis swap it's cheap I publish videos on Aerodrome and various other old coins regularly on this channel so if you found this useful feel free to subscribe

let's have a look at how much longer this really can last using onchain analytics let's try to look behind the price data now we're currently up 12% today this week we went up by almost 70% and initially the month didn't go as planned but now we're picking up in some we are up 130% almost this month but again things were not smooth we had a bit of a roll roller coaster right in between let's see what happened here and let's see whether or not we are coming back down again now I am publishing videos on Bon regularly on this channel and the very first video was published more than a year ago to be precise 372 years ago and that video already outperformed an average video and up to this day it still gets some views now at the time the price was at 543 now we are at 455 so more than a 10x and so I'm trying to be early on this channel I try to publish videos on Meme coins that have positive momentum that do have potential more upside if you don't want to miss the next video Fe you to subscribe feel free to potentially even hit the notifications now let's go into the onchain analytics of Bon onchain we've got 820,000 holders and within the memec coin Universe Bonk is the largest on the Solana chain Dogecoin is its own token Shea Eno and P are on ethereum and so this gives us a first idea of what the potential upside is if B was to do another 10x from here it would be very close to Dogecoin with a doubling it would already go to number three with a quadrupling it would be close to shiino now since the market caps are so large it is important how much Capital there is on ethereum versus Solana there is some kind of Tailwind here because in the last 2 years Solana outperformed ethereum quite a bit by 84% and this is likely going to continue there's more and more activity on Solana ethereum is getting crushed and part of the reason is the lackluster performance of ethereum relative to bitcoin since the move from proof of work to proof of stake in under performance of more than 60% and so it's not unreasonable to play with that scenario that at one point in time the largest meme coin across all chains could be on Solana and not on ethereum anymore so that would bring us a 3 to4x to cross shba Eno now with those various launches across the Bon ecosystem and with the listings on centralized exchanges Etc the number of H us over time those kind of graphs look quite skewed and initially I thought this is manipulation but I'm not so sure I think those are simply transactions from market makers to and from centralized exchanges now on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 20 million Bonk tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token so there are 40,000 or to be more exact 42,000 wallets that have that kind of capital in Bon on chain if you go another 10 X in minimum holding so 200 million tokens we are at 9,400 wallets another 10x which brings us to around $100,000 worth of the token we've got 2,600 such wallets now we can see how all of those wallet cohorts are recently accumulating and that accumulation happened pretty much since the beginning of the month across the board we can also see how there is ever Rising interest in Bonk on the left side we see the number of recurring versus new Traders per day on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day and both of this is rising very nicely but of course there is a danger in buying something that's already quite hyped right whenever attention shifts to other assets then of course the price could also potentially bleed and so this is how it goes on the left side we see the US dollar trading volume per day on the right side we see this normalized to 100% every day and we can clearly see how attention for Bonk comes in waves it goes up and down and up up and down and currently we are obviously very high on attention we can also see that over time the small retail investor tends to have less and less of the trading volume and the larger investors tend to have more and more of a say in the trading volume and so here's likely a chart you have never seen before when we bet on Bon we are betting on the Solana ecosystem as well but we also want to outperform Solana right otherwise we can simply just buy s Sol what we see over here is not the Bon US dollar price we see Bon measured in so so Bon's performance relative to Solana and what's so interesting about this chart is that there seems to be some kind of a trading range not a perfect trading range but still sometimes trading volume is very very high sometimes it's rather low and whenever it's high the price also tends to be high currently if that trading range doesn't break then the upside isn't really that great compared to the downside now don't get me wrong I do believe that speculation on mem coins make a lot of sense right now because just have a look at the best performing crypto categories in the last 7 Days Zoo themed is at number one the pump. fun ecosystem which is a launch pad of mem coins on Solana is up by 89% those are the kinds of categories that perform the best right it's all memec coin related what's performing not so well it's defi it's lending and borrowing and liquid staking and reaking and crypto gaming Etc it's all about finding meme coins and ideally finding them early because have a look at the best performing meme coins in the last 7 Days those are all small market cap coins they are not in the billions they are in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but even over here the tokens that are in the hundreds of millions they all performed that well and you would have had to buy them when they were still in the tens of millions and so really the market seems to be splitting in two segments now we've got on the one hand the Bitcoin buyers right the Bitcoin dominance continues to rise Bitcoin becomes a more and more important part of crypto and on the other side we've got all the meme coin traders that want to outperform by 10 or 100x the middle is pretty much shrinking away the gamey tokens the Dy tokens dpin infrastructure it's all going down relative to bitcoin it's either meme coins or it's Bitcoin and ideally it's small cap mem coins but then there's the question right how can we find a token like peanut when it's not at a$1 63 but when it's just at a few cents how was I able to publish a video on Peanut when it was still at 11 cents the answer is wallet tracking I track various influencer wallets I track wallets of people that move markets I track wallets of insiders and check this out we've got crypto banter over here that bought the peanut token when it was still at 3 cents this is Crypt Benta they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they buy a token and when they then talk about the token to this large audience of course this generates a lot of attention and that attention at least partially moves into buys and so this is then how that developed the price went from 3 cents to $163 it's up more than 5,000% since then and it's all because of the wallet tracking it's all because we've got some of the wallets that they trade with in total we track 33 wallets of Crypt Benta but it's not just Crypt Benta that we are tracking we also track Alex Becker we also track crypto gains we track various people in total we've got more than 421 wallets crypto is really not just a game of luck it also involves luck but it's a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more the expected value of a trade will shine through the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so the skilled people accumulate more Capital over time and so I like this wallet tracking strategy that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on that how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track them and how can we finally also interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about back testing it's also about risk mitigation and portfolio diversification there's more than 100 different tutorial videos in premium and so once we've got a buy or sell signal we have to discuss this that's why we've got dedicated altcoin chats as well so Fe free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so is it possible that Bon will go higher in US Dollars yes definitely because it's riding the Solana adoption and Solana is taking away more and more from ethereum is the current price very heated probably it is because Bon relative to Solana is quite expensive right now and it's unclear whether or not it can break out of the historical trading range I believe most upside is in the smaller meme coins I believe that most upside is in the pump. fun ecosystem especially the tokens that are in the tens of millions of dollars not in the billions of dollars if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Wz_ZJ3uJY,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana',

Solana a meme coin that's supposed to rise up until Christmas will that actually happen let's have a look at some onchain analytics let's see who's currently buying and selling who's currently causing this rally and's try to figure out if it still makes sense to buy ristmas right now now we're currently at a price of 455 and we are up 10% in the last 24 hours despite the trading volume rather trending downwards today we've got 53,000 buyers and only 37,000 sellers 48% buyers versus 42% Sellers and so of course the website CHS a countdown until Christmas but besides that we don't have a lot of information websites don't provide any unique Insight we want to play this player versus player game we want to buy low sell High we cannot get that kind of information from websites so we're going to do two things in this video first we're going to compare the different social metrics whether or not there's some kind of manipulation there then subsequently we're going to look at the onchain metrics we're going to look at buyers and sellers and see how organic this current really actually is so here's the Twitter account there's 13,700 followers and on telegram we've got 15,800 subscribers at the same time there's 167,000 holders so pretty much a 10x compared to the social metrics that's not necessarily that common yes it's normal that the number of holders on chain tend to be larger than the social followings but 10x is is quite a bit of an outlier and so let's look a bit closer at those onchain metrics and see whether or not all of those holders are completely organic or if this is just tens of thousands of bots what we've got over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders over time and this is a chart that we want to see we want to see more first-time Traders than recurring Traders because that means an expanding investor base on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day the token was completely dead up until the 22nd of November let's have a look at the trading volume and let's segment by minimum Holdings so on the left side it's in US Dollars on the right side the trading volume is normalized to 100% per day and this seems relatively natural right it seems like most trading volume happens by small retail just a bit by medium and even less by large retail small retail is all the wallets that have up to $1,000 worth of the token medium siiz retail is up to $10,000 and large retail is up to $100,000 and so we see that over time there's less and less small retail that makes up the trading volume but there is some kind of a turn around here right on the 28th of November let's compare this with the price the 28th of November is over here so it seems like this is the point in time where the price tended to not go up anymore it went down by 70% since then now the token got launched at the beginning of the year but the trading volume only started coming in in the last few days so what we see here here is the number of small holders medium-sized holders and large holders over time and that's based on minimum holding thresholds so it's equal to a minimum holding of $11,000 on the left $10,000 in the middle and $100,000 on the right now what's interesting here it seems like at the beginning the number of holders went down and that's true for all of the wallet cohorts and then pretty much nothing happened right we've seen how there was Zero trading volume and then everything woke up but the number of large whales only went up by maybe 8x the number of small retail investors went up by almost 200x those kind of discrepancies don't really make much sense right it makes way more sense that the growth is somewhat relatively speaking equal so we see in general this massive number of holders more than 10 times the number of Twitter followers which is not normal at the same time we see all of those small wallets those comparatively small wallets growing very quickly I don't think this is natural yes on the face of it the token ownership tends to be relatively equally distributed as in the whales hold pretty much the same as mediumsized retail large retail and small retail this all looks okay but the way how the number of holders developed doesn't really look organic to me this seems like there is massive manipulation going on and maybe the 70% drop is just the beginning this does look like manipulation to me and the thing about manipulation is that we cannot predict where the price is going in what direction the price will get manipulated it does not mean that just because there's manipulation that the price has to crash it simply means that it's unpredictable I personally prefer to buy tokens where there is some kind of predictability where we actually see long-term accumulation by a lot of small investors and where maybe the Wales take some profit but not that much to kill the potential rally by small retail now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stable coin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stable coin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collapse so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us deped the market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FTX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stablecoin market kept going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly heated what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to pick at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential flaw here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the alt coins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of AI agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can we buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet tracking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tending to make the right right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bitboy crypto sold virtual tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit by crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2,500 per. who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases with which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky plays regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these buy and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle chesse that bought $100,000 worth of the token and that was at 48 and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dedicated chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $65 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you I am a fan of organic growth I'm a fan of predictability right if there's organic growth across small retail we see those very nice smooth waves and they don't turn around tomorrow and crash massively unless there's big news normally we see nice long-term growth and then maybe a turnar around at some point and then nice long-term slow down but we can nicely trade this right we can figure out when is there this turn around when there is not organic growth when the price action is all done by a few whales that created a lot of Bot accounts to make the holder numbers artificially High then I simply just stay away I don't think that's the best way to deploy Capital if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as

suffering or rather weeks of suffering maybe months of suffering the P token or the meic token is finally going up now the question is what's fueling this really does it still make sense to buy how much more upside potential is there in this video we're going to look at relative valuation metrics we're trying to figure out how polygon meic is standing relative to the competition now this is the situation today we are at 52 cents roughly and we are up 133% today and this week we are up more than 38% and this is the chart most people might be looking at this is the meic price in US Dollars over the very long term and it seems like there's some kind of a flaw here have a look at this it seems like we always turn around somewhere around the 30 cents Mark the first time we had been at this level we went up by more than 800% the second time we went up by almost 400% and so far with this current bounce since the bottom we are up roughly 80% but does that mean that from here we've got another rally of say one 150% almost maybe even almost 200% now this is the simplistic approach how some retail investors look at things right you simply just draw random lines on charts and to pretend that those kind of lines mean anything but I don't think it's the best approach I think it's better to actually look at opportunity costs to look at relative valuations now let's discuss the relative valuations in a second I first want to share some statistics about this YouTube channel I've published several videos on meic on this channel before and it seems like especially recently those kind of videos tend to outperform in average video so the average video is here in Gray and the recent meic video made pretty much double of what a typical video would do and it still gets a lot of search interest and so this is a potential hint that retail does have some interest in the token right it's not a completely dead token it is a token that gets discussed now with Bitcoin climbing from one high to the next and getting closer to the 100K a lot of people are considering what are alternatives to bitcoin because for Bitcoin to do another 10x it needs a lot of capital it's probably not going to be the most levered play so in order to benefit more from this current Bull Run maybe something like meic makes sense right maybe there's some kind of inherent leverage in meic and so let's compare a meic investment with a Bitcoin investment the best way to do this I believe is with a relative valuation chart so this is now meic relative to bitcoin again this is a very long-term chart and we are actually at an all-time low relative to bitcoin it's not a message flow but still we are still 11% below the lowest prices in 2021 temporarily we went down more than 30% versus that low 3 years ago now it's important not to underestimate the kind of volatility here we already know that Bitcoin can go down Say by 70 or 80% in the bare Market that's already pretty risky when we buy something like metic this is Amplified in other words you can't put as much of your entire wealth in meic compared to what you can put in for example into Bitcoin investment ments should be risk adjusted and so initially when Matic got its adoption and when it launched it outperformed Bitcoin by more than 800% but in the last 1 and a half years roughly since February of last year metic did worse compared to bitcoin by more than 90% if you decided in February of 2023 to buy metic over Bitcoin you'd now have 90% less money and so yes meic is going up by almost 40% this week but in the grand scheme of things relative to bitcoin it's really just a small blip in a marathon of suffering now where does this all come from it comes mainly from the change of tokenomics with the move from the meic token to the P token so this is now the supply development of the P token it's growing over time and that Supply goes to the community Treasury and it goes to validator incentives when people bought the meic token right there's a one-on-one conversion from meic to P the expectation was that all token inflation is gone that is all finished in 2022 with the migration that has changed and that's why a lot of people are disappointed now a little bit of toen inflation might even be justified in that case if polygon medic was to outperform all the other chains right now but this is unfortunately not what we are seeing when we look at the total value lock development in the last month we see that the newly hyped SE chain is doing very well we also see as so often that Solana is doing pretty well but Matic in the last month only had a total value locked increase inrease of 0.86% it was the worst number across all of those chains now again this wouldn't necessarily be that much of a problem if the main usage of polygon maic wasn't defi right total value locked is a success metric of defi adoption but have a look at the largest tokens in terms of liquidity on chain on polygon bet is defi or gamei liquid staking metic is defi gold game token is gamey a lot of other repped assets that all get used in defi it's a very much dii dominated chain it's very different to what we see on Solana for example have a look at Solana it's all just memec coin trading right and this is what performed pretty well in the last months now to be fair measured in US Dollars the P token or Matic might continue to go up because currently the crypto Market is expanding very rapidly what we've got over here is the stable coin market cap over time and we saw this Contracting after Terra Luna imploded after the anchor protocol was busted after us depack then subsequently we saw the FTX collapse and then we saw the turnaround starting in October of last year and now we see money flowing into crypto again right Fiat deposits get held by various crypto codies and then we saw the turnaround again in October of last year now the crypto Market is expanding again Fiat currencies get deposited with various custodians that then issue the dcoin equivalent on the blockchain so a lot of money is flowing into crypto this pushes up various prices and of course a rising tide lifts all boats the boats do get lifted though at different speeds now I'm not sure if this analogy still works but still the altcoin market as a whole actually currently is underperforming Bitcoin so this is not necessarily just a meic related problem yes the toomics updates are medic related but when we just look at others and we look at the others dominance so that measures how much of all of crypto's market cap is in the alt coins that are not in the top 10 which is by the way true for the maic token it's below the top 10 then we're seeing how the significance of all of those altcoins is going down since beginning of the year by 27% in the last 3 years that went down by roughly 50% and at the same time the Bitcoin dominance is going up so Bitcoin as a fraction of all of crypto increases and Bitcoin dominance tends to turn around once we are at a level of roughly 70% in other words when Bitcoin dominance is crashing that means the alt coins are doing better and this is the point in time where polygon Matic might also outperform but currently we are not yet there we are still at 60% we still have 10 percentage points to go and of course we all know why Bitcoin is outperforming everything else right all the money from traditional Finance is now flowing in there's a lot of purchases through the Bitcoin ETF and of course there's no meic ETF if you want to buy meic you have to go through something like an OTC dealer or through a centralized exchange now currently the Bitcoin ETFs scoop up the supply at a rate of 6.6% now this is an annualized number we just look at the history in the in the last 14 days we annualize this then we get to that number currently the Bitcoin ETFs hold 5.4% of the Bitcoin Supply so the supply will more than double within those Bitcoin ETFs if we continue at the current accumulation rate and so when crypto is expanding like this but the others dominance is going down where are all the gains in the last month we have seen a lot of gains in the pump. fun ecosystem now in the last week this turned around we see how now the very risk on Meme coins take a breather and so if you don't like all of that volatility right if you don't like to get that much into risk on assets you can simply just be very passive and short the relative valuation of various dii protocols so for example I bet on falling prices of this asset over here it has very little volatility and it tends to underperform very consistently since beginning of this year more than 60% now I'm not sharing how to set up this position or what kind of position that is over here on YouTube I share it though in premium if you do want to get a bit more risk on then there are of course still the altcoins that have very small market caps so check that out there are tokens that went up more than 700% in the last week and those are still in the meme coin category right those are still Solana meme coins for example over here I made a video on cerebro more than a week ago and nobody was interested in that video the price at the time when I published that video it was 7.6 cents now we are at roughly 50 cents and so I Tred to find those opportunities regularly on this channel right I tried to figure out where is there still some growth where isn't the market cap already that large or where is the token inflation already that large where we see dumpage all the time where can we actually still get our multiple X returns and so I make those videos regularly over here so feel free to subscribe potentially even hit the notification Bell because again the YouTube algorithm isn't necessarily that favorable for tokens that aren't yet that well known the question then arises how was I able to spot a token like this when it was still at 7 cents here's the answer the answer is I like to track wallets I try to find out wallets and then I track them I try to figure out what are other insiders doing what are top Traders doing what are other influencers doing that potentially move prices and have a look at this this is an alert for cerebro how Kyle chesse bought the token at 7 cents he sold his SPX 6900 swapped it for cereo SPX 6900 by the way went down since then and this is how the price developed up by 500% roughly and so here is that Kyle chesse he's got more than 13 ,000 subscribers he tends to make a lot of bets and some of those bets don't play out but the ones that do they tend to make multiple X returns and so here we go those are the wallets that we found by Kyle chesse we've got 12 of his wallets that we actively Monitor and we don't just track Kyle chesse we also track Crypt Benta for example right a Channel with more than a million subscribers when they talk about the token of course a token goes up afterwards we've got 33 of Crypt ventor wallets again we've got more than 400 wallets that we are tracking here's another channel that we track this is Alex Becker 1.5 million subscribers and again here has his wallets 12 in total and so I really think this is the way to generate Alpha in crypto right if you want to outperform others we don't just draw random lines on charts we don't just hope for the best I think the best is to copy the people that already did very good trades in the past it's not necessarily trying to reinvent the wheel and so that's why I made a dedicated tutorial course just on this topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track them and how can we finally also interpret the signals that we get from the trkking again it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the bitcoin.com it's not just about wallet tracking it's also about back testing it's also about onchain analytics it's also about relative valuation charts and portfolio diversification risk management Etc there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total and so once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare our onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individ all coins as well so free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you so can the Matic US dollar price go up yes of course it can but I don't necessarily think that relative to bitcoin or relative to the small cap altcoins the risk to reward is much better I think there are better investment opportunities out there if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I AP you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

try to figure out whether or not this really can last let's try to find out who's buying here who's selling here now we're currently at 5 cents we're up more than 60% today alone and the nice thing about the token is that it's still 100% traded on chain which means we can directly look at the transactions on Solana and see what's going on there's no black boxes in terms of centralized exchanges and there is potential upside right once we get the listing on those centralized exchanges now crypto is all about being early it's buying when there's still enough upside potential let's have a look at Nom Nom relative to other meme coins that are currently trending on Solana so this is Dex screen.com it shows the onchain activity and we are ordering here the top trending tokens by their liquidity pool size and nnom is currently at Place 22 it's one of the top performers in that region besides the opk token but that was launched only 11 days ago the risk profile here is very different now here's the first little piece of onchain data that I believe everybody should look at you don't need any fancy tools for this simply just go to dexc screen.com and have a look at this here we can of course see how the price went up in the last 24 hours but we can also have a look at the buying volume versus selling volume now what's interesting here we can see that there is 58% of buyers versus 42% of sellers but they're buying volume does not have that much of a discrepancy in other words the buyers tend to buy less than the sellers sell so current holders are taking profit when you sell a token after a 700% increase of course you've got way more dollars that you're moving around compared to when you simply just buy this is a very natural behavior it shows that the r is somewhat organic I also think it's a great approach in general when you buy a token and it suddenly doubles the next day taking out the initial cannot hurt there's simply too many people that became paper millionaires but then all the wealth came crashing back down again it's important to take profit from time to time now to find out whether or not this really can continue we of course can't just look at the website right everybody looks at websites the websites are entertaining but they don't really give us a market Edge we want to look at data most people aren't considering but yes the website is somewhat funny let's first have a look whether or not there is obvious manipulation going on so we've got roughly 5,000 followers on Twitter or on the X platform we've got 3,000 followers in the telegram Channel and we've got 7,000 holders on chain so all of those numbers somewhat match this is good a red flag would be if one of those numbers suddenly is one order of magnitude higher than the others now why am I talking about Nom Nom in the first place the reason is I like to trade where currently the attention is I like to trade where currently the gains are made the overall altcoin Market as a whole is actually currently losing against Bitcoin it's the meme coins it's the pump. fun ecosystem tokens that outperform the rest is not doing that well have a look at this this is the performance of various crypto categories in the last 7 Days pump. fun seems to be at number one but it's actually at number two number one are the zoo themed tokens so that of course also includes peanut and the fretch token we've talked about both on this channel now within pump. fun Nom Nom is one of the top performers and the reason why I think it's interesting is because the market cap is exactly in that sweet spot it's not at the billions of dollars yet where it's very hard to again double and triple but it's also not just 6 million where we could see a rock pole tomorrow it's just right in terms of risk versus reward the market cap is 57 million upon a listing on a centralized exchange this could easily also 10x like the ACT token did or like peanut did and so I've talked about this now several times on this video Let's Start let's have a look at the onchain metrics what we've got over here is the number of first-time Traders on the left and the number of token transactions on the right please please ignore the latest data point because today has just started we can see how the number of transactions is absolutely blowing up in the last 3 days but there is something dodgy happening with the number of firsttime Traders it seems like there had been some artificial manipulation at the beginning because 19,000 firsttime Traders on a day make zero sense when the number of recurring Traders is only 244 again when we look at the holders now on chain we only have 7,000 so this very much looks like wash trading this looks like a lot of wallets that bought and subsequently sold just to generate some volume just to generate some attention when we filter those first-time Traders out and we just look at the recurring Traders we do see somewhat of a natural Trend though so it appears as if we have seen in the last 3 days some real growth here some organic growth now who are those buyers is this small retail is this the Wales on the left side we see the trading volume on the decentralized exchange so mainly radium on the right side we see this normalized to 100% per day so left side US dollar right side percentages and as so often with meme coins we see that attention comes in waves now have a look at what happened relatively speaking with that trading volume it appears as if the largest of the wallets are taking up more and more of the trading volume so this is not just a th000 small little wallets that are buying it's the wallets that already have between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of the token that continue trading now here's what's so fascinating it seems like the number of whale wallets so the number of wallets that have at least $100,000 worth of the token is not going up the number of retail wallets is though now how organic is that growth your guess is as good as mine because it's very very quick but this is a hot Market on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 20,000 tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token in the middle it's a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right a minimum holding of $100,000 and so yes the number of whales is coming down somewhat but seeing growth across both of those cohorts is relatively reassuring if we only saw growth here on those very small scales and zero growth on those two other segments then it would really look like manipulation but here it's not really clear this can be very much organic now the number of we wallets is not going up the Holdings by those way wallets though is and that's not just in terms of US dollars here on the right it's also relatively speaking so when we look at the entire token balance the whales now hold almost 60% of the supply small and medium-sized retail together only hold roughly 10% of the supply so those are the wallets that have less than $10,000 worth of the token yes the US dollar value of small retail went up by roughly 7x but the value that's held by the Wales went up way way more than that by roughly 300X now let me show you how I find those kinds of tokens very early in a second but before we do this feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various meme coins regularly on this channel and again I try to be very early now how is it possible to spot a token like peanut that is now the largest of the pump fun ecosystem tokens how is it possible to spot such a token early it R up by almost 1,500% in the last 7 days and it's now got a market cap of more than 2 billion at a price of $2.14 the way to find those wallets is through wallet tracking so we want to know wallets that tended to do very good calls in the past that potentially also have a very good following that tend to be insiders you want to have these very valuable wallet and we then track whenever they buy and sell and so have a look at this we've got Stan crypto and crypt Benta who bought peanut at only three cents since then we are up almost 7,000 per. Krypt Benta has a huge following they definitely influence prices they've got more than a million followers on YouTube and through our onchain analysis we found more than 33 of their wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets so we've also got wallets by Kyle chest 12 to be more exact we've also got wallets by crypto gains who tends to do very risky plays that can 100x though 55 wallets of him in total and so I strongly believe in this approach I don't think the best is to just randomly scroll a list of meme coins and then buy something the best is to follow the people that already have a good track record because crypto is both a game of luck and skill right the more the game is played the more Capital allocates to the people that have the skill and the luck component becomes less and less important so I like to follow way I like to follow the people that did do the right calls in the past and so I've made a dedicated tutorial course just on how to find different wallets of influencers of top Traders how to then track those wallets and get alerts whenever they buy and sell and how to then subsequently also interpret the alerts that we get it's all part of the premium membership there's not just wallet tracking in premium right there's also onchain analytics all the charts that we looked at today the tools for that and how to use them is also in premium what we've also got got over there is risk management portfolio diversification Etc there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total so feel free to check it out it's currently 125 per month the price will increase the next week there is a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I'm considering to buy some numnom tokens as well I haven't bought any yet but I might buy some after publishing of this video by rotating some of the gains I made in other coins into that token if you got some value of this video feel fre to subscribe I proba you a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7bhVc1qPF0,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'Scroll', 'WHY', 'nomnom']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7bhVc1qPF0/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-14T09:14:22Z

we actually get all that risk compensated does it make sense to buy so is there still upside potential let's have a look at what's driving buying and selling let's have a look at what's driving adoption let's see where the actual opportunities now are what we see over here is the Solana price relative to the ethereum price during the crypto winter we saw Solana underperform ethereum by 85% now it's close to its all-time highs again but how much higher can it go what we've got over here is a very similar chart this is the Solana dominance or how much of the entire cryptocurrencies market cap of all of crypto is in Solana this topped at around 3.6% and it's now at 3.2% at least in the last half year we did not see Solana outperform the rest of crypto now the altcoin market as a whole didn't do that well ethereum also didn't do that well in the last few months now Bitcoin did do well and so we don't see another all-time high relative to bitcoin this is now Solana to bitcoin and it's a reflection of this chart this is Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin becomes a more and more important part of the crypto ecosystem and usually that happens up to a point once the upside potential for Bitcoin isn't there anymore once people rotate their gains over that's then when the alt coins perform very well and that's also when Solana gets a lot of more adoption probably so in the past we've seen the altcoin Ries happen somewhere around 70% of Bitcoin dominance when Bitcoin was 70% of all of crypto and that's when Bitcoin really underperformed versus the rest it happened at the end of 2020 when Bitcoin was close to 40K and now Bitcoin dominance is at 59% so we probably still have some way to go now here's what's so fascinating about Solana the onchain metric for look actually pretty good however we don't see the outperformance in the price as we've just seen check this out in the last month the best performing blockchains in terms of total value locked were Solana base and the soy network no real surprise here right this is where all the mem coin trading is at this is the total value locked of Solana over time recovered pretty well close to the all-time high as well so we had defi summer in the second half of 2021 where pretty much any blockchain peaked subsequently a massive crash and Solana was able to recover quite well this is not true for example for the binance smart chain it's also not true for our launch it's also definitely not true for polygon and that reflects in the price as well so Solana dominance isn't really growing anymore despite the total value locked continuing to grow it's hard for cryptocurrency to do another 10x when its market cap would then be double that of ethereum or half that of Bitcoin Solana is simply very expensive now I'm not sure if B&B should be higher valued than so so BMB has probably also seen at ceiling but it does seem like there is some kind of invisible glass ceiling but then comes the big question right if Solana can't perform that well anymore relative to other cryptocurrencies if it simply just goes up and down to the same degree as Bitcoin does where is now the opportunity because there is obviously activity on chain surprise surprise the answer is of course in Risk on assets especially in meme coins so check this out this is the performance in the last 7 Days according to different categories within crypto number one is the pump. fun ecosystem so that's a memec coin Launchpad number two is El musk inspired then we've also got deepin but next comes cat themed bass themed we've got frog themed and dog themed and memes and so that's where all the opportunity is and it seems like this is also heating up again check out the Solana decentralized exchange trading volume we are picking up again in the last month the liquidity never left and it seems like more and more of the trading happens in an automated fashion because the number of failed transactions tends to go up in other words those are very likely also trading Bots that simply just try their best to get into the action very very quickly and so some subscribers on this channel are commenting this below this video right why are you currently always publishing videos on Meme coins the answer is that's where currently the gains are and it appears as if there are four chains where all the acon is there's obviously ethereum there's Solana there's base and now there's also so and so I personally I don't think it makes sense to be too much exposed directly to Solana to simply just buy s o if you want to be risk off simply buy Bitcoin because bitcoin's dominance tends to rise if you're looking for opportunity it probably makes more sense to be directly involved in mem coin trading now the issue is that mem coin trading is very risky it's very hard to not fall for the rock PS it's very hard to not buy the honeypots it's a game of skill and not just luck so does it make sense to buy a token that went up by thousands of percent in the last 24 hours or are this all scams or does it make sense to buy a meme coin that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars how much upside is there still what's the perfect balance between risk and reward at what point do we make the cuto off how do we filter the problematic tokens to answer those questions we need to learn as much as possible right we need to learn about blockchain analytics we need to learn about wallet track we need to find out what are other influential people buying and selling winnings come to the people that have most skill over time of course there is some luck involved but there's also skill involved and the more we trade the less the luck component becomes important and the more important the skill component becomes and so there's more than a 100 tutorial videos on the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below there's a tutorial video on how to use our onchain analytics tools you've probably seen this in Prior videos on this channel where I analyze a mcoin you can pluck in any any ethereum virtual machine based token in there you can pluck in any Solana token in there there's also a tutorial on how to build those tools and how to extend them there's also an entire video course on how to find other influencer Wallets on how to find wallets of successful Traders and of course we've got our own influencer tracking as well for example here influencer Kyle chesse just bought more of the gold token and yes I talked about go yesterday on this channel already opportunity and risk is directly linked the more we can lower the risk though by avoiding the scams Etc the better there are also dedicated Chats on various altcoins directly in premium where we can discuss this in the community there is a onewe money back guarantee as well so in case you don't like what you see simply just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% so again I believe that Bitcoin dominance is likely going to continue to rise so a broadly Diversified basket of alt coins is probably not going to cut it it has to be very concentrated bets in small market cap altcoins preferably meme coins buying Solana directly is probably not worth it anymore speculating on Solana though besides Bas and soy I believe can be very profitable looking forward to your comments directly below this video looking also forward to see you subscribe I publish videos fly on this channel on Solana but as said also on various meme coin opportunities thanks for watching see you on premium and see you in the next video

impressive the largest decentralized exchange on Solana radium its token almost doubled in the last month while Solana went pretty much sideways it only increased by 10 20% now let's have a look at what's driving all of this why is radium outperforming and it's try to figure out how much longer this really can potentially last now we are currently at $289 we are up 84% this month and Solana's price development looks very different at first this outperformance is surprising because there is some kind of tight coupling between the two radium is a huge part of Solana the trading volume on the entire Solana chain was 3.9 billion in the last 24 hours the trading volume on radium alone was 2.9 billion radium is riding a bullish wave on top of another bullish wave decentralized Finance is recovering quite a bit from that defi winter so across all of defi we've got now $87 billion worth of total value lock we crashed from 180 billion all the way down to 37 and now we are recovering again this is across all chains Solana's recovery looks stronger we are almost at all-time highs here and we are accelerating in the recovery now within Solana radium has seen most gains in the last month we've seen 94% of total value locked increase none of the other larger protocols came even close and so radium is very very close to making actual all-time highs that EX seed the defi summer in 2021 so it seems like there's something fundamental going on behind this price rally it's not just the price pumping it seems like the usage is increasing let's dive a bit deeper into those usage statistics on the left we've got the decentralized exchange trading volume across various protocols on Solana and of course radium is the largest here in purple and of course it's also fluctuating quite a bit now on the right we see the liquidity or the capital that's locked up across those different decentralized exchanges that fluctuates a bit less and again we can see growth and so radium's market share within the Solana decentralized exchange ecosystem is increasing on the left again we've got the trading volume that's now currently at a market share of 62% on the right we've got the liquidity that's at the market share of 68% now where does all of this trading activity come from it comes from pump. fun so that's a Launchpad for various mem coins just have a look at the chart on the left the number of newly listed tokens is massively going up it just hit an all-time high one week ago and it outnumbers the tokens listed first time on radium by more than 40x so first the tokens get listed on pump. fun if they are successful if they get traction then they move over to radium to get more liquidity and so because of the success of pump. fund the number of newly listed tokens isn't just high for Solana it's high for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole so that's what we are seeing on the left we see the number number of newly created tokens and Solana is outpacing everything else again because of pump. fun now the big question is is this all organic or is this all Bots creating random tokens that in the end aren't getting used let's have a look at the number of transactions on chain let's also have a look at the number of Traders on chain let's start with the transactions guess what line is Solana Solana is dominating every other chain Again by a multiple X base has one .2 million transactions per day Solana has almost 20 here's the number of unique Traders over time base is currently at 350,000 Solana is at 3 million now we all know where this activity is coming from we all know the use case of Solana we know why the trading volume is so active it is pretty much a casino it is mem coin trading have a look at the top trending tokens in the last 24 hours ordered by liquidity number one is a meme coin number two is is a mem coin number three is a meme coin they are all mem coins it's nothing but mem coin trading in the past we also had some defi in the past we also had some crypto gaming now it's all just memes and this is to a degree Justified because all gains are made in the memes check out the categories page on coin gecko the performance in the last week all of this is memes AI memes regular memes pum fum memes yes we've got liquid Stak to and deepin but among the top of the top per performers it's all meme coins and so that's the problem right meme coins are hyper risky and the returns are somewhat concentrated yes the sector as a whole grew by 30% in the last week but some make multiple X returns While others go to zero meme coin trading is the definition of a player versus player game there's only winners and losers there's no net sum positive so it's all about being more skilled than others to make money with meme coins we need to be better informed than most we need to have better data than most it's not that easy to be among the few winners and so we have to ask ourselves right what's the edge that we have in the market where do we know something that most others don't now I've built the premium membership that's a paid platform where we do various things trying to get an edge in the market for example we track various influencer wallets we know when Crypt banter is buying and selling things we know when Jesse echel is buying and selling things he has Jesse echel with 223,000 subscribers he sometimes buys coins to then afterwards promote OTE them on the channel and of course a promotion creates visibility visibility creates new purchases and it's always good to be among the early buyers right to buy when the influencer is buying and not when the YouTube video is launched now this works better the larger the channel is Right we've also got Crypt with 1.1 million subscribers for Crypt Venta alone we've got 33 wallets that we are tracking in total we've got more than 400 wallets and so that's how we try to beat the market right we look at those different signals we look at when are influential people buying and selling selling when a good Traders buying and selling and then we discuss those different signals in dedicated altcoin chats in telegram for example we got a nice signal for the book of ethereum token which then afterwards went parabolic and besides all of the signals and all of the discussion there's also a lot of tutorial videos for example an entire course on how to find those different wallets and how to track them but in total there's not more than 100 videos in premium the link is down below it's the biton trade.com it's currently 125 per month but there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium simply message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so to sum it all up I believe that the mem coin trading frenzy is likely going to continue and I believe that radium is well positioned for that I also believe that the price appreciation somewhat reflects the increased usage Solana seems to be winning the race and within Solana it seems to be the meme coin trading that's taking over the simple bet is to buy ra y but the real upside is in buying mem coin that have only a few million of market cap and that aren't in the billions if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in

look at what's behind this really let's have a look at who's buying here who's selling here how much adoption do we have is there potential growth on chain let's have a look at the data most people are not considering let's look very closely at supply and demand because that's in the end what determines the price now this is the rally I'm talking about we are up 22% today alone we are now above $5 this week we went up by More than 70% this month we almost 4X and this year we almost N9 xed but things hadn't always been that Rosy for the GFI token and the cost for this phenominal collapse from $11 all the way below 40 the cause of that is token inflation because this year is the price chart we are very far away from the all-time high but this is the market cap chart there's simply just way more GFI tokens now floating and so the capital that's Bound in golden finch has never been as high as today now here's the problem with token inflation as more Supply hits the market as more tokens get issued the demand has to grow at the same rate if it doesn't grow as fast then of course the price has to go down increasing Supply same demand means decreasing price and so this is then how that looks like over time in January of 2022 we were at 5 million Goldfinch tokens now we are at 71 million in the last year alone the supply increased by 60% now sometimes projects simply have initially a high token inflation but in this case for the the gold finch token that's not the case we are still just at 25% circulating Supply the supply will forx from here at some point in time and so you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not going to bore you with the marketing D on the website of course one of the catalysts for GFI is the real world asset narrative people are speculating right now that black rock gets more and more into the crypto real world asset game as in that you tokenize real bonds that you toonize real property and Goldfinch was pretty much one of the first players in this market now here's the total value locked of the protocol over time at some point we peaked out above 50 million then we crashed down again then we had our odd Spike again now we are very close to alltime losss again Less Than 3 million of total value locked while the fully diluted market cap is at a bit under 600 million doesn't really look like the best deal now here's the thing sometimes there is simply the future priced into a price right sometimes people anticipate that a new product will be launched and that product will in the end attract a lot of investment and thus a very high price to total value lock ratio might make sense let's have a look at the developer activity of gold finch this is GitHub and this shows us how many changes programmers do to various applications and unfortunately there hasn't been a change since May of 2023 so for almost a year there was not a single code change this almost looks like a dead project if there is no other GitHub repository somewhere but this is the one that's officially linked on coin market cap and so the reason for this Val might be potentially manipulation right it might be a lot of big guys getting into the token potentially pushing up the price to then afterwards crash it unfortunately we don't have the full picture because more than 90% of trading volume happens on coinbase and on gate.io we do have 6% on Unis Swap and we can look into the details of that but it definitely will be an incomplete picture have a look at this this is the number of holders over time in the last month on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 200 GFI tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $11,000 that's what I'd consider small retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's a 10x from the left chart so minimum holding of $10,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 so it's 200 tokens 2,000 tokens 20,000 tokens minimum holding and yes the number of holders for retail did increase quite a bit by maybe 15% or so on chain mediumsized holders grew to a similar degree the Wales didn't grow as quickly there's no dumping from the Wales but there's definitely also not a lot of accumulation most of the purchases happen from the small guys still it's roughly 15% more holders while the price during that same time period for X so it's definitely not just organic Demand on chain there's definitely something happening in those centralized exchanges that we unfortunately do not have a lot of insight in I don't have a crystal bar either where this price is going I personally stay away I like to see more information on chain and I like to see more activity in the GitHub repositories if it's your first time here feel

cap so we have got positive momentum potential upside let's have a look at the blockchain analytics let's see who's buying and selling here and how solid this really actually is so we're currently at a price of 30 2207 the price went up by 176% in the last month alone and the rally seems to be pretty stable right we are climbing with not that much volatility at least recently of course we did see our bearish times as well now let's figure out who dumped the price before let's have a look at the number of holders over time let's figure out what retail is doing versus what the whales are doing so we've got almost 177,000 holders on chain and the largest of the holders tends to accumulate over time this is good now on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 4.5 million hoppy tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 wor worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's now $10,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we see how small retail continues to accumulate we also see how mediumsized retail continues to accumulate only the whales the very very large wallets don't really change in numbers now let's zoom into the blockchain details of just the last month where we got our almost 3x return here are the same kind of charts with the same kind of thresholds but only only for the last month again retail is accumulating very very constantly the number of retail investors grew by roughly 15% or so then there's mediumsized retail That Grew by roughly 5% and then we've got the whales a very slight change of a decline of two wallets now why am I talking about hoppy on this channel it's because it's in that sweet spot it's not that small and it hasn't just launched yesterday it's going to rock pull tomorrow but it's also not that big that there's no more upside potential when we buy meme coins we want to get multiple X returns we don't just want to have 5 or 10% returns and so here is how hoppy faes relatively speaking this is the trending tokens on ethereum and hoppy is the 19th largest in terms of liquidity in terms of trading volume in the last 24 hours it's at rank 15 yet the market cap is only at 94 million now let's have a look at how we can potentially time this token how can we buy and sell in general I'm a fan of buying tokens that have a growing investor base where a lot of new investors come into the token because the more new people are in the higher the price can sustainably go now what we've got over here is the number of new users in purple and the number of returning users in Orange on the left side we've just got this numerically on the right side we've got this normalized to 100% now what's interesting here is the 10th of October the number of new users really went up quite a bit and those are the kind of data points I like those are the kind of data points that potentially precede price relies let's have a look at that 10th of October it was pretty much the bottom and subsequently we've seen a rally of more than 100% now unfortunately we don't see a lot of new users today but still it very much makes sense to look at this metric regularly now those charts come from a tour that I've developed myself you can plug in any ethereum token into this tool it's part of Premium link is down below the Bitcoin str.com but there's also potentially something to worry about for hoppy and that's its current attention whenever attention spikes it tends to be a bad time to buy have a look at this the 6th of July a lot of buyers a lot of sellers a lot of attention here's the 6th of July on the price chart it was the absolute tippy top and subsequently we saw our draw down of almost 80% the hoppy token is not necessarily at bottom attention it's not as high as it used to be but still it's not at the bottom so this could be not that great again this needs to be closely monitored when this turns around it's a bad idea to keep holding let's say you would have monitored the number of daily buyers in July and then you decided say on the 13th of July or so that we peaked in attention this would have saved you from a subsequent decline of more than 60% now analyzing tokens and trying to find entry and exit points is always good it's always nice to use us onchain tools but the question is always what's the interesting token to buy in the first place and for that I prefer wallet tracking I like to look at wallets of influencers that might promote a coin afterwards or at least that tend to have a good win rate in the past and so here's again something from premium we've got our influencer trade Channel and here's a free Little Nugget that I want to share influencer Kyle chesse just bought the ndx token which is a meme coin that Rives the wave of SPX 16900 we also talked about SPX 16900 very early on this channel here is that influencer Kai chesse 133,000 subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets we've got 419 wallets in total and so of course I also share my trades with premium members and for your information I have already bought that token as well so be aware of the potential conflict of interest here right if you now buy after me the price goes up why I'm holding if I then sell before you sell I make money off of you this is where the ndx token is currently at we bought over here we got our signal over here we obviously at an all-time high so we un profit and the reason why I like the token is so much because the market cap is still just at 19 million so it's still another four to 5x until we are at levels of hoppy and so if you actively trade meme coins and you've got the impression that you still come very late to the party again feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com there's also a 7-Day money back guarant so in case you don't like what you get over there simply message me within the first 7 days I refund you 100% no questions asked so again to summarize Hoy it seems like attention currently is very high we do not see a lot of new investors in the last few days it seems like things could be somewhat heated it doesn't mean that the price can't go higher but it does mean that at least a stop loss is warranted it's very much possible that the price crashes another 50% you don't want to be involved during that crash if

this video we're going to look at why is this happening this is the rally I'm talking about more than 50% just today almost 200% in the last week and it's 300% in the last month now what's going on this video we are not going to look at the website and read all the marketing Jazz because in the end that does not count instead we will focus on data that most people are not looking at we're going to look at the developer activity on GitHub how many code changes are being made by the programmers we're going to look at the capital that is locked up in the mettis blockchain most important of all we are going to look at onchain data as in what is the retail investor doing versus what are the whales doing who is driving this rally really what we have over here is the GitHub repository of the metod this protocol and there aren't too many updates One update a week ago another one 3 weeks ago another one on November in this year very few updates relatively speaking so it probably is not really fundamentally driven as in a new project being launched at least we can't see this in the GitHub the next question is capital inflows is maybe that layer two on top of ethereum suddenly being used much more here is the total value lock chart of metis on defi Lama it's currently 80 million was it almost 500 million 1 and A2 years ago it is spiking up recently though that little Spike here is unfortunately not caused by more Capital being bridged over to mettis because when we take the same chart and we denominate this in mettis tokens this is going down so all of the price rise we see in US dollars in total value locked is simply because of metis itself and because of metis ecos system tokens going up now some people look at ether scan to see the holder development over time and that's the small little chart here currently there are 19,000 holders and it went up by 0.24% in the last 24 hours I personally think this is way too little information instead I like to use a tool that I developed myself and that's also available in the premium membership so that's the bitcoin.com link is down below if you want to use that tool let's look at what the whales versus the retail holders are doing here with the mettis token on the left side we've got the number of holders that have at least one token that's currently $77 it's small retail with a bit of Pocket Change in this token it's currently at roughly 9,000 and it's already cutting this number here in half the 190,000 we saw on ether skin in the middle we see the mediumsized holders 10 tokens so $800 roughly worth of the token this is cutting that number in half so it's not $ 9,000 holders anymore but it's 5,000 let's go one more order of magnitude up 100 tokens or roughly $88,000 worth of the token this is the top 1,400 holders now we can go three more levels up this is the Wales 1,000 tokens or $80,000 worth of the token 224 wallets in total 33 wallets have almost a million of the token and then for 10 million that's this chart here on the right three wallets that's probably mainly ecosystem or centralized exchange wallets now notice the behavior of that chart a lot of people jumped on and yes we do see a bit of growth in the last days especially by the larger holders right they accumulated relatively speaking more than just the regular dude but that kind of increase on chain cannot really correspond to a rally like this the price of metis is almost at alltime highs again but the number of holders didn't go up as much as in the past so I think s exchangers do have their hands in this game we've now 16% of all of trading volume on okx and another 16% on gate.io 10% on qoin now we don't have binance here yet but maybe just maybe that will change maybe it's even binance that's driving this R right now accumulating some tokens in order to then allow for spot trading but maybe also even launching Perpetual Futures we are not seeing that much excitement on chain it doesn't look like this is a rally driven by the broad masses this seems to be a rally pretty carefully planned by a few people with a lot of capital in other words this rally is very much dictated by what those very few people want can this further continue definitely especially if binance does do in the end its listing for metis will I personally jump on this probably not because I don't really feel comfortable with the data I like to have some kind of view on what's going on under the hood and when the trading volume is not currently in centralized exchanges and when they dictate the price I don't have visibility on what the masses think my central approach to crypto is to always make datadriven trades I want to see the data so that I can jump in and jump out accordingly it's your first

Token Tokenomics,  #basicattentiontoken #Bat #crypto","bat the basic attention token is on a massive rally and the question is what's going on here who's buying who selling what's happening let's have a look at some fundamentals let's also have a look at onchain analytics to go beyond the price action because in the end the fundamental question is does it still make sense to buy bet is there still some upside potential or is this a short-term pump and dump now the basic attention token is the token issued by the brave browser team it's the leading browser that focuses on privacy and that focuses on crypto and the adoption of the Brave browser has been growing over time and so today the price of bat is at 28 C it's up 36% this week this month it appreciated by 73% but we did see way larger relies in the past with subsequent dumps so we do see that the price is not necessarily one-on-one correlated to the popularity of the browser now here is what's very important when investing in any altcoin when we buy an altcoin we take on more risk compared to just buying Bitcoin in other words if we take on that additional risk we also should get more compensation for that risk right why would we increase our risk if we don't get more return thus I believe it's more important than looking at US dollar prices to actually look at relative valuation prices did an altcoin outperform Bitcoin because if the answer is no then at least in the past it wasn't necessarily the best investment and so unfortunately that's true for the basic attention token this is BET divide Ed by Bitcoin and the chart starts in May of 2019 and bat underperformed Bitcoin by more than 93% and yes we are in a rally recently but that rally is somewhat of a blip in the marathon of Prior suffering but let's have a look at what drove this price decline and let's try to figure out if this small rally here is the beginning of a turnaround to get a bit more details let's have a look at the onchain analytics so let's look at the buyers and sellers let's look at transaction data now the first piece of information we have is the number of holders we've got 443,000 holders of bat on the ethereum chain and we can see that with this current rally a lot of new wallets buy the token so what we're seeing here on the left is the number of new users per day in the last month and we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over I would not be surprised if today is even higher than what we've seen yesterday now on the right side we see the relationship of new users versus return in users per day so now we normalize to 100% this is how it looks like on the left when we add the returning users in other words most of Trading still happens by existing wallets potentially even automated trading potentially even bot trading now what we've got over here are three charts that I look at for pretty much any token that's discussed on this channel and that's the number of retail investors versus the number of whale investors on chain and the way this segmentation is done is through minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 3,000 bet tokens now at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 and that's what I consider retail now in the middle we've got mediumsized holder so that's now 3,000 tokens minimum holding on the right side another 10x so 30,000 tokens now for the chart in the middle we go a 10x in minimum holding compared to the left so that's now 30,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right side another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we can observe that there was a peak in the number of retail holders in November of 2020 we see that Peak a bit earlier for medium-sized retail in April of 2020 already and for the Wales interestingly enough they continued accumulating longer up until January of 2022 so retail tended to offload for a long time the whales tended to buy up until a point but they have stopped those purchases as well afterwards and again those are very long-term charts the number of all holder segments are going down for the last 3 years roughly and so let's see what's going on in the last month again we went up in the price by 73% do we also see accumulation at least shortterm the answer is unfortunately no the number of retail wallets went down by roughly 200 medium-sized retail stayed flat and so that the number of whale investors and so the only thing we can actually see is that there's more activity so the existing Traders trading more among themselves there are more buyers and sellers recently it's not comparable to what we have seen during the bull market in 2019 2020 but we are picking up just a little bit and so that raises quite a few question marks right how can a price go up by More than 70% in a month when the number of holders on chain tends to go down when people tend to rather exit the token I believe the answer lies in Market manipulation it lies in Market making it lies in the people that own most of the token and the market makers of course have a lot of bet and the trading doesn't happen necessarily onchain anymore it mainly happens now offchain it happens in the centralized exchanges the black boxes where we can't look at the actual data so check this out most trading volume happens on binance but it's actually not those 16% that are moving the price I believe it's the bets on the price the lever instruments the derivatives that move everything we've got binance here again with 64% trading volume so 93 million but we've got tool bit Futures as well now what on Earth is tool bit this is the tool bit centralized exchange and I believe this is simply a white labeled binance maybe for a market where binance is not allowed because just have a look at how similar those websites look we've got a magnifying glass we've got a login a sign up a download button and our language selector the download button shows a QR code and here we've got binance the exact same setup also with a QR code over here for downloading so this is simply just another front end for the same thing that happens under the hood so really binance is moving almost 200 million worth of of trading volume in the last 24 hours now don't get me wrong the BET US dollar price can still go up but that's probably not necessarily idiosyncratically to the BET token or to the brave browser it's mainly because crypto itself is expanding because what we see over here is the stable coin market cap over time the chart starts in 2022 and with the collapse of teral Luna and the anchor protocol and when us depa we started a contraction of the market we saw how the bare Market started and how a lot of prices went down this then turned around at the beginning of October of last year since then the stable coin market cap is going up and that's recently even accelerating and so this is how that works right when you send your hard-earned fiat currency to a centralized exchange that centralized exchange sendes over to a stable coin issuer that stable coin issuer hopefully holds those funds in a safe account and then issues or mins the tokens on the chain and what happens on chain we can see over here in this chart so when this is going up more stable coins get min because more Fiat is flowing into crypto when this is going down then people are withdrawing from crypto they pull out their fiat currency and so when money flows into the crypto sector of course all kinds of assets can go up because there is correlation right correlation looks like this everything is green but the risk to reward is not necessarily the same for all of those tokens I still believe though that the best risk to reward is still in the meme coins it's in the smaller cap meme coins have a look at those performances here we saw big doc think going up by 67% in the last week or lucky coin by more than 400% bully by almost 300% Etc you get the gist right most of those performances are in the market caps of hundreds of millions not in the billions the big question always is how can we get one of those outperformers early right how can we spot a small altcoin that has the potential to 3 four 5x in a single week my answer to this is the following it's shown over here on the screen it's wallet tracking so I like to track the wallet of influential people of top traders of people that move markets of influencers I like to look at what are they buying and what are they selling and for example over here two days ago we had the martini guy that bought the moon token and that was directly on pump. fund so that was the Solana blockchain and he bought this for 412 and we then of course discussed this at length but have a look at what happened to the Token it made a massive massive runup more than 1,000% Then Came Crashing Down no surprise here but have a look at the current price it's currently at 493 so even after this massive collapse the price is still up by 8X or so that's how early some of those signals can be right how else can we find tokens like this that shwed up like that this was literally a 100x since the signal now here is the guy that we are tracking here this is the martini guy he's got 149,000 subscribers and of course when he talks about a token that token can generate some attention and the price tends to go up and so here's the Magic in all of this through onchain analytics we found various of his wallets and ret track his wallets we've got 12 of his wallets in total finding those wallets is the actual art of the game now not all of those signals go up that much that quickly but still have a look at this this is Alex Becker he bought the Spectra token at $238 and again that was just a bit over 24 hours ago that's up now 14% And probably you know Alex Becker he's got 1.5 million subscribers the reason probably why the token didn't go up much more yet is because he hasn't published a video on the token yet at least he didn't promote it recently here are the wallets that we Track by Alex Becker we've got 12 in total but there's also a way to get these kind of tokens even earlier to follow influencers that are a bit more risky in their approach for example here we've got crypto gains that bought Spectre already at 16 cents so that was way way back in the day it was over here since then we are up more than 1,500% and so here's crypto game he's also got a bit over 100,000 followers so again when he talks about especially the smaller tokens they can get quite a bit of momentum we do have a few more of his wallets he tends to change wallets quite often we've got 55 that we are tracking in total by the way we track more than 400 wallets and so really this is I believe where the real Alpha is it's not buying those large cap cryptocurrencies with billions and billions of dollars it's buying the small ones but doing it smartly not just picking something randomly in a list it's following the smart money it's following the people that tend to make very profitable trades and thus get very similar returns to them and so I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic so this is eight videos in total how can we find influencer wallets how can we track those influencer wallets and how can we interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about back testing it's about portfolio diversification and risk management there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we have got a wallet signal we also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we also have to compare our on analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first week and I refund to you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so is 28 cents the ceiling for the BET token I don't think so I think it will go up together with the rest of the market but will it long-term outperform Bitcoin probably not I think the best risk reward is really in the smaller tokens if you got some value this video feel you to subscribe I publish vide regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well

who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at some onchain analytics to find out whether or not it still makes sense to buy now now here are the top trending tokens on the base chain and the tokens are ordered by their liquidity pool size and sometimes it makes sense to buy something that's not at the top in order to still have some upside Migel is currently at place number 15 and it's one of the top performers on the entire chain and so this is then how that looks like on the chart is this a really that can continue or is this a pump and dump here's something I always do when I do research on a token I go to Dex screen.com and I look at this section over here the section on the right of course we see that the price went up by 64% but we can also see why that happened we've got an overhang of 52% buyers versus 48% sellers while the buying volume is only 51% versus 49% in other words the sellers tend to move slightly more money than the buyer per transaction and this makes total sense since the price went up a lot people take out the initial capital and some now let's dive a bit deeper into the onchain analysis now we've got 162,000 holders on chain but not all of those holders are created equal let's split this up based on minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got retail on the right side we've got the whales and in the middle we've got the mediumsized Holdings so the way we split this up is by minimum holding in order to be counted on this chart on the left the wallet needs to hold at least 7,000 tokens now at the current price of migles that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token and so we go another 10x for the chart in the middle now that's 70,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token and the whales are on the right with $100,000 worth of the token we can clearly see how this recent rally is driven by retail the retail investor is accumulating the number of whale investors is pretty much constant again that's a sign of a rather healthy rally because just have a look at this when the price didn't really the number of small holders stayed flat while the number of large holders went down this is something we see very typically across all kinds of assets the small holders simply just buy and hold a token hope for it to Moon the big big whales they tend to buy and sell much more actively and so seeing small retail adopting the token more shows us that the rally could be more sustainable now in the last 24 hours the token went up by almost 80% we are now at 15 cents in the last week we went up by more than 300% and this month we even red by more than 500% and so here's what's so nice about the base chain there are currently two major blockchains that get most of the attention it's Solana on the one hand which has seen a total value locked increase of 38% in the last month and it's the base chain with a growth of 26% now with Solana we've already got a lot of mem coin launchers with the base chain that's not necessarily true on Solana everybody can launch a mem coin very quickly with the pump. fun ecosystem with Bas there's no such thing that got properly adopted thus the meme coins that do make it on Bas they tend to attract more Capital right the capital is more concentrated now let's go back and have a look at the miggles onchain statistics we see something very interesting here the number of returning users tends to outweigh the number of new users by quite a lot now this can mean one of two things either a lot of Engagement by the centralized exchanges or a lot of wash trading by Bots unfortunately when we dive a bit deeper the wash trading thesis tends to confirm itself because what we've got over here is the number of buyers and sellers over time and seeing such a disparity between the number of buyers and sellers is not natural whatsoever 60,000 buyers on a single day makes no sense especially when there's only 160,000 holders now this doesn't mean that the miggles price has to crash from here but it does mean that there are some actors in The Token onchain that do some shady things now here is a common misconception most people think that currently the altcoins are doing pretty well but nothing could be further from the truth as a fraction of all of crypto the others dominance actually went down by more than 30% so the market cap of all of the cryptocurrencies that are not in the top 10 went down at the same time the Bitcoin dominance went up so Bitcoin gains more and more importance within crypto the only part of crypto that's not going down is the very risky meme coins this is where all the gains currently are made and here is what migles has in its favor it's both a zoo themed token but it's also a token on the base chain and both of those categories are doing incredibly well right now and so just have a look at this table this is the meme coins on the base chain miggles is at number three but it's still less than one tenth the size of Brad and so this is where the upside could be coming from right we've already seen this with the trending tokens on the base chain miggles was at roughly 15 and the meme coin ecosystem is definitely not as developed on the base chain yet compared to Solana but here's something that might have even more upside just have a look at what tokens outperformed everything else on Bas in the last 7 days it was the tokens with very small market caps it's in the millions maybe tens of millions it's not necessarily in the hundreds of millions or in the billions and so the art in crypto I believe is to figure out those tokens when they're still very small now how can we find those tokens I believe the answer is in following people that tended to make very good calls in the past now what are the kind of people that can make the best calls it's the Insiders right it's the people that know more than others check this out we tracked down a wallet from Jesse Pock and he bought the miggles token when it was still at 2 cents now who's Jesse poch he's the creator of the base chain or check this out we subsequently saw how influencer Kyle chesse bought migles for 7 cents now who is Kyle Chessie it's an influencer with 133,000 subscribers he tends to buy and sell rather actively with a lot of capital he tends to move markets and so that's then how the price developed since Jesse poch bought it went up more than 500% this is I believe how we can get an edge in the market right it's not just picking random tokens on a list it's trying to find out what are the Insiders what are the influencers buying it's trying to copy trade the top Traders and so check this out we've got 12 wallets by Kyle chesse alone in total we track more than 400 wallets and I've even made a tutorial course on this whole topic how to find influence wallets how to then subsequently track them and how to finally then interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com but premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about risk management it's also about back testing more than 100 different videos in premium in total and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss it we have to discuss when to buy when to sell that's why we've got dedicated all coin Chats on the individual altcoins as well so fear free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to buy migles I believe yes I believe that a lot of money will flow into the meme coins on base and Migel still has quite a bit of way to go to catch up to DJ and to Brett if you got some value on this video feel free to

Aero Tokenomics,  #aerodrome #aero #crypto","Krypto is recovering and Aerodrome on the base chain is leading that recovery now things haven't always been that great right we had a massive crash now we tend to go up again the question is what's causing the sell pressure what's causing the buy pressure who's buying who's selling let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people aren't considering we're going to look at transactions we are going to look at tokenomics let's dive deep into the details aerodome is currently at 80 cents it's up 9 % today this week we are up by 50% but have a look at this we crashed from more than 80 cents down to 40 cents to now recover let's have a look at what actually went on over here I believe at least parts of the recovery can be explained by the base chain outperforming all the other blockchains in the last week check this out this is defi Lama and it looks at the total value locked change in the last 7 days and Bas outperformed everything else we are now at 1.5 billi million dollar locked on base and Aerodrome is the largest of the decentralized exchanges on the base chain let's also have a look at relative variations to for example Unis swap right is the current price the current market cap Justified now if this is your first time researching aerod Drome then maybe you should be considering following channels like this because I published a video on aerod Drome 138 days ago that was when the price was still at 47 cents so that was over here on the four off of March but let's now have a look at what those 122,000 holders are actually doing how can we dive into this number and here is what's supporting the aerodome price it's especially the retail investors what we've got over here are three charts the left chart shows the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 Arrow tokens so that's directly on chain and that's equivalent to $ 87 right now in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $8,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's at least $80,000 worth of the token isn't it interesting how the number of holders is increasing very constantly over time retail in aggregate tends to never sell medium-sized retail sells sometimes and I've just updated the right chart the whales actually did sell a bit in the last month and since those Wallets on the right are on average 100 times more important than the Wallets on the left that kind of a drop can explain quite a bit of a price crash but again the retail demand continues to stay strong here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month small retail grew by roughly 13 14% medium-sized retail grew to the same degree but the whales they tend to sell off and because the number of whales went down and because those kind of wallets are a 100 times more important than those kinds of wallets that's why we see this massive volatility in the price now let's have a look at to economics because they are very important for Aerodrome 54% of all of Supply is in a voting escrow and another 7.4% are again in smart contracts here's the initial distribution of Aerodrome who got what kind of tokens the team got 14% protocol grants are another 10% so that's also development for aerodome and this is then how the supply grows over time according to EPO currently we are at 1.1 billion aot tokens floating so that puts us roughly here on the chart Aerodrome launched roughly one year ago and the number of tokens roughly doubled in that time in the next months the supply will grow by roughly 10% per month and so those are the two major forces right when the supply is growing by 10% per month and the number of investors Grows by 15% then error can of course go up if the whales aren't selling too much in the meantime the toomics of aerodome aren't too pretty unfortunately but the adoption is pretty high the demand unfortunately is very volatile though because again it's very much dependent on the base chain how much adoption can the base chain get and when it's outperforming any other blockchain then aerodome tends to outperform as well right Aerodrome is the main bet that's idiosyncratic to the base chain there is no base token let's compare the aerodrome valuation with the Unis swap valuation and let's look at total value locked as in what's the current market cap of Unis swap what's the current market cap of aerodome and how much capital is currently in those platforms so Unis swap has a total value locked across all chains of 5.2 billion the market cap of Unis swap is 8.4 billion so there's roughly $1.6 of market cap per deposited Dollar on chain for UNIS swap aerodome has a fully diluted market cap of 930 million the total value locked is 585 million and that's equal to $1.66 of market cap relative to total value locked so the valuations are very very close to one another it's not like there's a lot of growth that's currently priced into Aerodrome the problem however is token inflation right the number of tokens will increase much faster for aerodome relative to Unis swap so we looked at the fully diluted market cap not at the current market cap a lot of trading happens on chain on the base chain so the price is very like discovered by the market there's not really manipulation going on of course there's also trading on coinbase but directly on chain on aerodome there's 18% of trading volume and the Perpetual Futures Market doesn't have much action either there's one more very important fact to consider and I haven't finished that analysis but I encourage you to do so in case you put a lot of money into Aerodrome and that's the staking program when you're staking Arrow the promise is that you're getting more Arrow tokens back in the future and you hope of course that the arrow token stays somewhat at least stable and currently the number of Arrow that's been locked is increasing and that's good for the price right it artificially lowers the circulating Supply pushing up the price with increasing demand but that number doesn't always have to go up have a look at this this is the equivalent on the binance smart chain the pancake swap token the cake token when they launched their staking program the number of cake that got staked also increased over time up until 1 year after launch this is when people redeemed their cake and sold their cake and so that happened in the middle of April 2023 and so I have a look at this this is cake relative to BNB this is the middle of April 2023 after the unlock of all of those cake tokens the price fell by more than 50% so it's very important to check this out for Arrow right will there be a lot of arrow that gets unlocked where then people might take profit I encourage you to have a very close look on that graph and in case it turns around I will of course cover this on this channel as well if you want to know what kind of Trades I do feel free to check out the premium membership I for example shorted so I bet on falling prices of cake before the unlock I'm thinking about doing potentially the same with Aerodrome if premium is still too expensive for you because the crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough feel free to also check out our free telegram the link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting with you over there as well

Price Prediction, Sand longterm, Sand Tokenomics,  #Sandbox #Sand #crypto","the sandbox token is rallying massively the question is what's behind this rally is this manipulation by the market makers or is there maybe some usage behind all of this let's have a look at some data most people aren't considering let's dive deep into the blockchain analytics now it looks like everything is green today but some things are greener than others just have a look at this sand is leading the pack then we've got Mana then we've got AI Infiniti it looks like gaming is the name of the game today but do we actually see something on one chain happening for sandbox the answer is not necessarily this is the number of sandbox cross chain buyers over time it went from more than 400 in February of 2022 to currently 29 per day here's the number of sandbox land and asset sales first we had our land sales that peaked in 2021 then we had our asset sales that peaked 2 months later and now it's just a former shell of itself here's the D centraland volume overtime it picked at 4 million now it's at 7 ,000 here's the number of transactions it didn't go down as much compared to the value because here's the thing while the usage is going down of course the price of scent also went down especially the relative valuations to for example Bitcoin and that's this chart here initially when everybody was hyped about Defi and crypto gaming in 2020 and 2021 sandbox really had a nice rally of more than 2,000% since launch but then the staking program and the reduced usage took its toll and so sandbox relative to bitcoin had a very clear underperformance of more than 97% now this is not the US dollar price right this is sandbox relative to bitcoin but what this also shows us is that the recent rally is somewhat out of the ordinary we haven't seen such a rally for a long long time we are now up 88% From The Bottom the question is can this rally last longer now here's one of the reasons why sandbox was performing so poorly relative to the rest it was token inflation so the liquid supply of the sand token grew regularly there were unlocks every 6 months and yes there is still one unlock coming but that's then about it the remaining token inflation is only 10% and so in the last 3 years we Sixx in the supply that of course explains quite a bit why sandbox had a hard time appreciating right when demand doesn't grow as quickly as Supply you have a falling price and so seeing that toen inflation coming to an end is one positive thing the second positive thing is that even though we don't see a lot of new value transferred on Sandbox we do see new users have a look at the number of transactions over time this is actually going up in the last two months I'm not sure though if this is the entire story because what I noticed is that in the last few days it seems like especially the tokens that are mainly owned by binance and where binance is the market maker they tend to be the altcoins that do the best so maybe not all of the rally is natural and at some point those whales and market makers might dump but have a look at this the spot trading volume of sand is dominated by up bit in binance the Perpetual Futures Market is dominated by binance there was almost a billion dollars worth of scent traded in the last 24 hours and have a look at the exact opposite so it first appears that everything is upright all the prices are appreciating but it's actually not 100% true the prices are appreciating that do not have too much liquidity on chain but the very very liquid tokens they aren't doing that great so here it's almost all green but have a look at the most liquid tokens on the Solana chain in the last 24 hours not all of this is green it's actually a rather mixed picture I think it's very hard to estimate what the market makers will do with their tokens now right there's a lot of euphoria a lot of attention on crypto and so it does make sense to increase volatility of the price generate some attention on those tokens to potentially sell them off I think most gains though are to be made with the smaller tokens and with smaller I mean simply lower market cap have a look at the top performers in the last s days those were not at crypto Rank 10 or 50 most of them were much smaller right rank 200 rank 250 another 260 another 260 another 200 those kind of market caps aren't as large and so when we trade those smaller market caps it's of course even more important to have a skill Edge right because the failure rate is higher the lower we go on the market cap the more failures we have as well so if we know more than the average Market participant we can also make some money and so here is how I identify ify winners before they rally have a look at this this is a buying alert of the influencer martini guy he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 and that happened on the pump. fun ecosystem platform here is what that token did it went up more than 1,000% to then subsequently collapse now right now the price is at 3013 and he bought at 466 in other words even after this massive collapse we are still 2x up if you never sold that's how early that signal was crypto is all about Market timing it's all about being early it's about knowing the tokens before the masses know it over here is the martini guy he's got 149,000 subscribers and we are tracking 12 of his wallets now check out this signal right not every signal has to go 1,000% not every signal is that risk on here we've got Alex Becker that buys the Spectra token just a few hours ago and that was at $2 46 since then the price is up by a bit over 10% now the reason why the token didn't really much more yet is probably because he hadn't yet announced this on his channel right he's got 1.5 million subscribers once he talks about spectr more right once he promotes it again of course the price will go up further right because more attention means purchases and so we're tracking also 12 of his wallets and so really this is I believe the fundamental way to make money in crypto it's trying to find the influencers it's trying to find the Insiders it's trying to find the people that move markets it's not just picking random tokens on a list it's actually trying to get a market Edge to know more than others and so I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it's eight tutorial videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track those wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin tr.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about back testing so there's more than 100 videos in total once we have a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to also compare our onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated altcoin Chats on the individual alss as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $25 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so can the S token go higher yes of course it can but it's not in the hand of the users as in it's not usage that's really driving the price it's mainly the market makers they're currently pushing up a lot of the tokens that they own it's hard to anticipate what they will be doing I think that most upside potential is still in onchain trading it's still in finding tokens that most people don't look at it's still in buying the things that are very low in market cap if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I proba youly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKDjpgPp_0,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'Maker', 'JUST',

quite a bit as well Solana tokens in general are doing pretty well now there's a lot of momentum let's have a look at how much longer this maniki really can last let's have a look at onchain data most people are not considering so have a look at how the total value locked on different chains is developing the amount of value locked in Solana grew by 28% in the last month it was one of the best performing blockchains if you haven't yet had a look at the blast blockchain you might want to do that as well that's growing very fast as well and if you want to get a bit more adventurous there's also the Merlin chain that grew by 169% in the last month but across the larger chains Solana is definitely winning the game and so Mani is up 30% today it's currently at 1.6 cents and this week it almost doubled but here's the thing about mem coin trading you do want to be very cautious with timing because over the long term man didn't do too well so let's have a look at the data directly on chain maniki has the fifth largest liquidity pool so there's $2 million locked up in the token and that's a lot relative to the market cap so most of Trading still happens on chain that's why you can look at onchain analytics and get a picture with very little Distortion we've already talked about slur book of meme the M token dock with Hat popcat Beer we've already talked about all of those tokens on this channel feel free to check out those videos now we want to find out how much more upside there is for manik key the first thing to note is that the centralized exchanges aren't yet supporting the token that much right because there's only another 4X if you go 100% on chain once we do a 4X in the price or in the liquidity we already rival slurf and book of meme so future growth really has to come from centralized exchange demand and I believe that's actually what's driving the current rally have a look at the last 24 hours the price went up by quite a bit but the number of buyers was actually smaller than the number of sellers in other words the buyers on average were larger with that trading amount than the sellers this could be accumulation by the whales it could be accumulation by the centralized exchanges which makes a lot of sense when you've got that much trading volume going on that many people interested in the token why not support this more why not be involved more in Market making there's no issue with the security of the token either the Dex I all score is very high 99 out of 99 no problem here and yes there is already ownership by centralized exchanges but it's not yet significant gate.io holds 4.5% of the token crypto.com 3.5 bitg 1.5 Mexi 1.4 and that involvement by the centralized exchanges is even advertised on the website down here so probably there was some kind of money or some kind of token allocation flowing to those centralized exchanges to enable Trading there but it doesn't look like those centralized exchanges have a large stake in this and that's probably why we see the recent rally there is going to be more Market making Happening by centralized exchanges probably the tokens will also be more promoted within the centralized exchanges at some point now the central question is always how organic is a rally and we have seen a lot of organic growth in the past now we see a lot of growth by the bigger players by the Wales the question is is there still a lot of social excitement is there still a lot of retail people jumping on this here let's have a look at the Twitter account we've got 56,000 followers and the views of the recent Twitter posts reach around 17K here 15K here 11k here and that's why the number of holders is 85,000 so it looks like this is actually organic and not too manipulated now with the involvement of centralized exchanges trading becomes a bit harder as well I personally like to trade tokens that aren't yet dominated by the centralized exchanges and I want to show you why have a look at this chart over here this is the number of users that are trading the money key token by the hour and there seems to be some Cycles over here right this tends to go up and down we have a low around 2 a.m. UTC we've got another low over here again 34 a.m. UTC here's another low same time of the day and it makes a lot of sense that at that time of the day there isn't so many new people jumping on this right this is when most people are sleeping this is also when there's few YouTube views and what's important about meme coins is that there is a correlation between a tension on a token and the price so when there's not a lot of people trading right now the price tends to be relatively speaking depressed when there is a lot of new people jumping in then of course the price tends to go up so it does make sense to buy meme coins on average when everybody else is sleeping around 2 3 a.m. UTC time zone that kind of strategy works very well when there's not yet a lot of market makers but of course once the centralized exchanges are getting involved then there are a lot of Quant traders in there as well and they balance out those effects so I like to always play against the weak competition right you want to be early you want to trade the tokens that aren't yet dominated by the bances and mexes of this world right now maniki trading is not yet dominated by the centralized exchanges there's still a lot of trading on radium directly on chain but that will likely change rather sooner than later here's another data point by by the way all of those charts here that we see in the background come from a tool that I've developed myself you can get access to that tool down below the bitcoin.com you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and look at those statistics for any token so feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com what we see over here is the trading volume per day by Trader segment and I've split this up in four segments small retail is the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token medium-sized retail is between $1,000 and $10,000 large retail is between 10,000 and 100,000 and the whales are the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token what's very interesting here is when we look at Wales and large retail so at the largest wallets the wallets with at least $100,000 of the token this is actually declining so medium-sized retail and small retail are getting engaged a lot of trading volume is happening but again note that in the last 24 hours there was less buyers than sellers while the price went up so even though retail might be trading a lot it's actually the larger wallets that are buying I will continue to make updates on maniki and on other meme coins on Solana if you're interested in that feel free to subscribe I publish you as regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got Telegram and you haven't yet joined our chat then feel free

Turbo Review, Turbo Price, Turbo Price Prediction, Turbo longterm, Turbo Tokenomics,   #turbo #memecoin #crypto","the turbo token is rallying again it more than doubled in the last month and the big question is how much longer can this rally last let's have a look at some on data most people aren't considering let's try to find out whether or not it makes sense to still buy turbo so this is where we are we are currently at 0.7 the price went up by 109% in the last month a lot of those gains just happened in the last few days the market cap is slightly above 500 million which means a doubling would bring it close to to pop cat if the price was to triple it would get close to Bonk with a 10x it would be among the top three meme coins and flip paye now tobo can be traded on the ethereum Chain we currently have roughly 40,000 holders I think it's important to look at those holders in more detail when are new Traders coming in when are Traders getting out a growing investor base is usually what increases mem coin prices sustainably and so let's have a look at just that what we've got over here is the number of new users versus returning users on any given day for tobo in the last 30 days we see that a lot of new users entered on the 16th of September you can also see that as a fraction of all of trading the 16th of September had been a day with a lot of new accumulation with a growing investor base and so here is why I like onchain analytics so much again the idea is the more people come into a token the longer the price can potentially rally and stay elevated the two vertical lines over here indicate the beginning end of the 16th of September so this is where we got this influx of new people and subsequently the price ried by another 50% now what's interesting is that we see again the price rallying right the price dropped first is now rising to a similar degree but at the same time we do not necessarily see that many new users coming in what's exactly going on here let's have a look at retail investors versus whale investors again those are charts showing the last 30 days on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 130,000 turbo tokens so at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $110,000 worth of the token on the right we go to $100,000 worth of the token now have a look at this big jump there was a lot of new people coming in exactly on the 16th of September the point in time we've already noticed before but what we then see is that the number of those retail investors did not necessarily grow medium-sized retail also did not grow but the Wales they grew yes they also bought a little bit on the 16th of September but then sold again but have a look at this since the 1st of October the number of whales is going up it went up by roughly 10 wallets and again those wallets here are 100 times larger than those wallets over here so 10 Wallets on on the right is equal to 1,000 Wallets on the left and so the accumulation by the Wales started over here they bought the dip they accumulated more and more and they are taking advantage of the current rally let's zoom out a little bit because all of the prior charts were simply just the last month what we've got over here though is a logarithmic chart of the entire history of tobo which starts in May of 2023 here's again the holding by those different wallet cohorts same kinds of thresholds but this time not just the last month but everything since tobo started trading and we see how the selling stopped in the middle of January of this year interestingly enough though the price turned around already a bit earlier in other words retail stopped selling here and this is when the price was able to subsequently rise quite nicely but it seems like the Wales again had been a bit earlier they bought the bottom potentially already in October of 2023 so here we go we see in October of 2023 the number of whale wallets went up slightly it then went down again but this was already the time when retail took over and stopped selling so it's always a move between retail and whales and very often the whales are the early movers it's very important to follow whatever they are doing when they are dumping it might make sense to be cautious let's have a look at the very largest wallets let's see if they are buying or selling let's look at the centralized exchange balances before we do this feel free to subscribe because I publish videos on turbo and on various other mem coins regularly on this channel now here's the trading on centralized exchanges the token can be bought pretty much everywhere binance is dominating the trading volume but we also have activity on okx gate.io on HDX and on qoin and so it's no surprise when we look at the top token holders that we see those centralized exchanges most Supply is held by uphold okx follows we've also got binance over here and bitet Mexi and crypto.com is also part of the party let's check out the two largest wallets here's wallet number one accumulated quite consistently up until the end of May of this year here's wallet number two also accumulated was trading a little bit the range but then also around May of this year started to sell quite consistently and so check this out this is the long-term turbo price and have a look at what happened at the end of May of this year the price went down by 65% and so it appears as if there is somewhat constant selling pressure in Turbo now the rally started with retail was then taken over by some whales but at the back of all of this we do see continued selling but it's not strong enough to depress the price right now those large centralized exchanges are very careful not to destroy this rally because as long as the price goes up the retail interest is likely going to grow as well and it seems like a lot of meme coins are currently rallying turbo is not an exception now all the charts all the statistics that I've shown in this video is part of a tool that I've developed myself that's available to the premium members you can plug in any token into this tool and you can analyze quite a few different blockchains so of course there's ethereum but there's also arbitrum Avalon binance smart chain polygon optimism and even some more obscure blockchains like linear manle and nosis premium also has a video on how to use all of those onchain analytics tools there's a separate tool also for Solana and of course we also have various Al coin chats where we discuss what might be the next turbo so the link to premium is down below if your portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram

strange the polygon price is going down it makes low after low while onchain everything seems to be fine the total value locked of the polygon ZK evm is relatively stable so we've got almost $100 million worth of total value locked and on the native polygon chain we've got $100 million worth of trading volume now here is one problem on that ZK evm polygon chain we see barely any activity only two 2 million worth of trading volume so 100 million total value locked but only 2 million of trading volume and that compares to other layer 2 block chains like arbitrum with more than $400 million of trading volume so 400 for arbitrum 900 for the base chain and 1.5 billion for Solana one can pretty much say that polygon ZK evm was a flop barely any usage so now we understand the price performance a bit more have a look at the number of unique depositors it's a for shell of itself we now have days where we've got less than eight bridging transactions now before we continue bashing on polygon I want to talk about one interesting statistic that can be used outside of polygon as well in case you're not yet aware in case you want to save gas fees for example because you're using ethereum and you don't have that much Capital relative to what needs to be paid for the transaction here's the best time to make those transfers there's the least activity on Saturday and Sunday and within the day it tends to be 5 a.m. GMT when gas prices are the lowest but let's get back into bashing polygon have a look at how much the number of average transactions is increasing and how much the average gas price is increasing the gas price is pretty much doubling while the number of transactions is only going up by maybe 10 20% or so what does this tell us this video is sponsored by the premium membership I never take any money from any c project I never take any affiliate links from centralized exchanges I never pump and dump coins instead I offer valuable tutorials in the premium membership feel free to check it out it tells us that polygon has a problem with throughput polygon bottlenecks the more transactions come in something very similar to what we've seen for example with Phantom check out the historical Phantom chart usually we had very very low transaction fees but then once the Phantom chain was used this Spike up to a thousand times of what it was during regular times before the problem isn't as bad for polygon but it still exists a little bit of an increase in the number of transactions increases the gas price quite a lot now how does Polygon compare to other layer tws well it seems like activity in general is going down quite a lot this is the number of users that bridge across various chains and of course this spiked around April of this year when also a lot of alt coins spiked and when we isolate the base chain we can see how there was a lot of activity during April we don't see that Spike though for polygon so there was a ton of trading on Bas and on Solana everybody was trading the meme coins polygon stayed quiet now I have talked about the toomics of polygon I have talked about the merge to POS I make several videos on metic regularly on this channel if you don't want to miss the next ones feel free to subscribe now let's talk about relative performance relative valuations Etc before we do this I publish videos on polygon regular on this channel so I talked already about the move to POS I talked about toomics Etc so if you don't want to miss the next videos on polygon feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly so there was one video titled the polygon metic death published one month ago still getting some views there was another one called the polygon metic collapse published 3 weeks ago and yes those videos didn't age too badly the price continues to go down now this is meic in US Dollars and it seems like we are not at alltime lows yet it seems like we can drop another 20% maybe it also appears as if sometimes we have these nice Ries right 150 157% even but what's triggering relies like this it's not polygon specific it was simply the overall Market going up because have a look at this we are now looking at polygon metic relative to ethereum and here the relies are much much more modest from bottom to top less than 50% and the decline since February of 2023 is r rather constant a fall of more than 80% and here's the thing ethereum itself is already doing very poorly let's have a look at the medic chart relative to bitcoin the safest of the cryptocurrencies the place to Simply Park the crypto funds here we've seen meic underperform by more than 90% and again the rallies in between do not look massive whatsoever that's very different to the US dollar chart so really it's a game of opportunity cost but how much lower can meic go now do we potentially see the ultimate floor here because in the end the game is to buy low and sell high and obviously we aren't very high now let's compare market caps so we've got 2.8 billion in the P token and we've got 1 billion in the meic token so in total a bit under 4 billion now what else is in the 4 to 5 billion range check this out we've got so for example so has an onchain trading volume of 120 million So 20% more than metic so just looking at current trading volume relative to market cap it seems to make somewhat sense the relationships are similar but here's the thing the total value locked of soy is increasing quite nicely it's not looking like polygon's total value locked a market cap of 4 billion is still pretty high especially when the toomics aren't that great and there's constant cell pressure there's still a lot of value to extract and so it appears as if polygon is becoming victim to this competition there are more and more blockchains launching every day with we've got already 317 blockchains just listed on defi Lama I personally stay away from polygon I don't really like what's going on with the momentum I don't like that there was no usage increase during April of this year and I also don't like that the market cap is still around for billion if it's your first time feel free to subscribe I publish videos regular a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow in case you've got telegram feel free to join us below you find two links one of them is to the premium membership feel free to

who's buying here who's selling here how robust is this rally so today we are up by 10% this week the price increased by more than 40% this month by 111% and in this year we more than 10 xed now let's have a look look at the fundamentals here let's have a look at token inflation how much new tokens are potentially hitting the market potentially depressing the price right the price is a consequence of Demand versus Supply if the supply increases very quickly then the demand has to grow at least at the same rate otherwise the price will go down and so here's a very useful chart this is from token. unlocks do app and it shows us the number of echelon Prime tokens over time we are currently at 35 million Prime tokens and one year from now this will will be at 55 million so the demand has to grow by at least 57% in the next 12 months for the price to stay stable but here's the interesting part we've already seen a lot of token inflation in the last year and obviously the demand massively outgrew this and so who's buying here is this the smart whales the people that have a lot of money or is this simply just a retail driven rally Echelon Prime is riding the crypto gaming wave and you can already see I'm not just running through the website selling you the marketing Jazz Etc I'm I want to look at the data most people are not considering and here's the nice thing about Echelon Prime we do have a lot of data on the token because most trading volume still happens on decentralized exchanges on Unis swap centralized exchanges are pretty much black boxes but decentralized exchanges are very transparent the Unis swaps of this world operate directly on the blockchain and so we can see exactly who is buying who is selling how is this developing over time and it's very uncommon actually to have a crypto currency that's already 3 billion in market cap where the centralized exchanges haven't yet had a lot of adoption now let's have a look at that data I have developed a tool myself to look at the number of retail investors versus the number of whale wallets and then we can see how much is this potentially growing over time how stable is that growth here are the results of that tool on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 40 Echelon Prime tokens so that's a bit over $11,000 that's what I'd consider reta in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's a 10x from the left chart that's now at least $10,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that at least $100,000 worth of the token or 4,000 tokens now those are very long-term charts they start in 2022 here are the same kind of charts just for the last month so when the price more than doubled the number of retail investors grew by roughly 15% in the last month the number of medium-sized retail grew by roughly 14% last month the number of whale wallets grew by roughly 5 to 6% last month so there's accumulation across the board with retail buying most the whales are part of the party as well but they're not buying in as much at least the number of whales isn't growing that much now there are two versions of this token there's a token on the ethereum Chain which is obviously very expensive to trade you have to pay 20 to $30 just in swap fees there's another ported version on the base chain and the base chain is way way cheaper and that's probably the first destination for for most people to buy this now we can look at those holder graphs also for the base chain let's have a look here is the last month it's the same kind of thresholds as for the ethereum chain so we can see the number of holders in general is way way smaller most capital is still on ethereum especially for the whale wallets but for the smaller investors we do see massive adoption here this left chart grew by roughly 48% in the last month alone base is now the 11th largest blockchain when we're looking at total value locked and recently the adoption is absolutely exploding I believe that Bas will be the new Solana a lot of trading will be happening on bass and I do expect that especially the Bas listed tokens will have a pretty good time in the next weeks maybe months and so I'm planning to buy some Echelon Prime tokens as well I say I'm planning to not I have bought because I never front run you guys I always publish a video first and then maybe several hours afterwards I buy myself I find it super super important to minimize conflict of interest if you're interested in this tool feel free to check out the premium membership link is down

XYZ another update on the protocol 11 hours ago an update even for the documentation 14 hours ago Etc so there is real work being done and constant code changes of course potentially means new projects being launched at some point now here's something I very much like the Yuma team has published a dune dashboard directly on the website there's a link at the top to look at the statistics and the statistics are all 100% transparent because all of this data comes directly from the blockchain so for example here this ever increasing total value lock chart it comes directly from converted blockchain data this is very very transparent the charts tend to go up up into the right so that initial impression that we had that this is maybe manipulation could actually be wrong maybe finally the market is realizing something now I've built a tool that I very often use on this channel this tool looks at what are currently retail investors doing versus what are the whales doing I show this in almost every video on this channel and this is very very useful data because it shows us what the smart money is doing on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 100 Yuma tokens so it's currently $380 roughly in the middle we go one order of magnitude up so that's 1,000 tokens so a bit under $4,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales so this is now 10,000 tokens almost 40K worth of Yuma in the wallet Now isn't that interesting this massive dump over here this happened in February of last year have a look at the Yuma price in February of last year was still at around $7 or so just to then go down all the way to $150 now the whale started accumulating again beginning in August of last year and that was over here right pretty much the bottom let's look at this on a logarithmic scale here we go this is where the whales bought and they're up more than 100% since then and they are still not selling now those are all long-term charts those are daily charts each of those data points is a day but we can also look at the hourly chart just for the last 30 days it's nice that we see an accumulation from all fronts here small retail Med medum siiz retail and Wales everyone is buying here now this is not your typical Shilling channel right if I simply just wanted to sell Yuma to you I want to buy early and then sell this to you pump up the price then I'd finish the video here but I'm not like that I want to show the pros and the cons and here comes a chart that is not pretty this is also a Yuma chart a very long-term Yuma chart this chart starts in September of 2020 and this is not humor in US dollars this is Yuma relative to ethereum so unfortunately had you bought Yuma at the end of 2020 and you held all the way to today including the rally you'd still be down relative to holding ethereum by 96.5% and this trend is very consistent where does all the cell pressure come from I don't know for certain but there might be the following contributor there is token minting happening over time this is not super rapid but the supply definitely is expanding somewhat it grew by 17% or so in those four years it doesn't explain an under performance of 96.5% but it was definitely also not good for the price development now here's the million dooll question that I cannot answer for you does it make sense to buy Yuma potentially for short-term trading right currently momentum is very bullish and all the wallet cohorts are buying longterm buying this over many many years I don't know fundamentally it's very very high hard to disrupt the Oracle Market this is what Yuma is trying to do right Yuma is directly competing with chain link the reason why competition is so stiff is because very often the data that is used for those oracles have a lot of weight to it for example the data of chain link is used to estimate how much is collateral worth for a def5 protocol now if you make a mistake there just a temporary mistake and you overestimate for example how much is your collateral Worth right what's currently the price of Bitcoin and you give a wrong answer then this can put potentially drain the entire funds of a defi protocol of a borrowing Landing platform so data reliability is hyper hyper important and you don't want to toy around with this and so I've got the impression that chain link has pretty much successfully monopolized that market if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down below",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltN1za0cY4,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'JUST', 'UMA', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oltN1za0cY4/hqdefault.jpg,2024-01-19T07:01:35Z

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this video does not constitute financial advice. This video is for entertainment purposes only. Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #bobanetwork #altcoin #crypto","the rally in Bobba network is not stopping we're climbing from high to the next high to the next let's have a look at what's driving all of this let's have a look at supply and demand let's look at the toomics is Supply expanding let's have a look at who's buying is this retail is this the Wales let's have a look at all of those very important metrics the price is at $15 we up almost 20% today this week we more than doubled and this month we more than fourx but things haven't always been that Rosy for Boba right the bare Market really crashed the price but it wasn't just the bare Market the tokenomics or more precisely the token Supply development wasn't that pretty now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just running you through the website like other YouTubers this is not how we can get an edge in the market we want to know more than others even looking at complex technical diagrams is not going to cut it we simply just want to know will the price go up or down and again that's only dependent on supply versus demand let's look at the supply now this is Cryptor rank. and it shows us potential token unlocks so here's the allocation of all of the tokens over here in this column we see the unlocked tokens and on the right we see the locked tokens so there's still 18% locked in the treasury 9% locked for the team and 4% locked for investors for the team and investors we're pretty much just halfway through and so this is then how that looks over time this is mesari and it shows the number of circulating Boba Network tokens over time at the beginning of 2022 we were at 155 million tokens now we more than doubled that and if the demand doesn't more than double at the same time then of course the price goes down we can also see this nicely on chain this is the holder distribution pie chart directly on chain on ether scan and the largest of the holding wallets is a vesting Supply wallet 25% of all Boba Network tokens are still vesting so those will go to the team or to investors Etc at some point in the future we can also see the development of that wallet over time and this is of course going down as the payouts to those people are made so some vesting is fine right the team has to get rewarded somehow but the question is does the supply catch up is the team actually doing a good job have a look at this this is defi Lama this is the Boba Network and at some point there was more than 600 million total value locked on that chain the bare Market crushed that total value locked but there wasn't really much of recovery we are still just at 7 million so a drop of 99% now is the team still working on Boba Network because that could potentially create new Demand right if the team releases new product that would be good potentially so what we've got over here is the GitHub repository so this is the place where programmers submit their code changes and yes we do see luckily some activity an update 1 hour ago over here another update 5 hours ago 6 hours ago 16 hours ago so yes there is activity there might be some hope and so with that recent price R who's actually buying here is this small retail is this the Wales is this manipulation let's have a close look on chain I have built a tool that distinguishes retail from the whale wallets it's available to the premium members link is down below the bitcoin.com you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 Boba Network tokens at the curent price that's $1,050 in the middle we see the number of wallets that hold at least 10,000 tokens that's mediumsized retail on the right we see the whales this is the number of wallets that hold at least 100,000 Boba tokens all of those wallets are somewhat long-term accumulating but again those are very long-term charts they start in 2021 and despite the number of investors growing over time the price developed like this right the growth wasn't fast enough to offset all of that vesting but times are different now right and we are in a rally we up a lot this month we for AED in the price what happened to the number of holders here are the same charts but just for the last month now I'm not sure if it makes too much sense to look too closely at those massive drops here because this could have several reasons it could mean some people move their tokens to a centralized exchange to potentially trade them there it could mean that a staking product had been launched it could mean a whole bunch of things but what I don't like is that even before that crash we barely saw accumulation in the last month even the number of retail wallets didn't grow the number of mediumsized retail grew somewhat but by no means enough to justify that rally the number of whale wallets even declined and so isn't that puzzling right we don't see more investors jumping onto the token but at the same time in the the last month the price for exed what happens here I think that it's people with very Deep Pockets that might be trading Bobba and those Deep Pockets are probably on centralized exchanges potentially manipulating the price most trading happens on gate.io coinbase is the second then we've got bid then we've got Q coin on top of the spot Market we also have the Perpetual Futures Market bybit is leading the party ext.com is closely Following xd.com being a wh labeled binance so all the action is happening on bit probably I personally don't like the I prefer to see onchain accumulation I prefer to see the transactions that actually underpin a rally I don't like the rally coming from a hidden place so the black boxes the centralized exchanges it makes it very hard to do datadriven decisions and so when you combine all of this the long-term underperformance because of the ever growing Supply that's not going to stop anytime soon with a total value locked that's a shadow of its former self with a lot of trading volume happening on centralized exchanges where we don't see data then I'm not sure if it makes sense to hope for the price to appreciate just based on the developer activity now I might be wrong I have been wrong plenty of times but if you found this information useful feel fre to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down

Price Prediction, Mini longterm, Mini Tokenomics,  #mini #memecoin #crypto","the mini meme coin on Solana is going up like a hockey stick the question is is this manipulation or is this proper Demand by retail let's have a look at how much longer this rally can last using onchain analytics so here we are we are currently at 7 cents the price went up by 15% today alone and it's the sixth largest trending token on Solana when ordered by liquidity there's $2.8 million in that liquidity pool now it seems always a bit dangerous looking for token directly on Dex screener right there's a lot of Honey pots there's a lot of scams let's have a look at the security rating so over here we've got the Dex tool page of mini and it's got a 99 out of 99 security audit pass so no worries on that front now I'm not going to walk you through the website and bore you with the marketing Jazz this is not how we can get an edge in crypto we want to know the data most people aren't looking at so let's start off with the simple things for example we've got around 10,000 holders on Solana and that compares to what 500 members in telegram that's odd but there we go there's also a second telegram Channel and that's got 3,000 so now it makes more sense now here's the chart why mini is an exciting token I rarely see charts like this this is the number of firsttime Traders per day in the token and that comes directly from the Solana chain normally we only have 100 to 200 new users but this shot up rapidly starting on the 5th of October and is now at around 1,500 new wallets every day now what's even better is that yesterday we have seen more firsttime Traders then recurring Traders we don't see that often so that means that the investor base is growing it's growing very very quickly and the more investors there are in the token the higher the price of course can go the trading volume is pretty equally split and doesn't favor any size so small retail is all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token medium ret retail goes all the way to 10,000 large retail all the way to 100,000 and Wales is then everything above 100,000 it looks like the trading volume is not necessarily dominated by the Wales and it also doesn't look like retail is losing ground again because a lot of new wallets enter now what does fluctuate though is the interest in the token and that causes quite some price fluctuations as well this is the trading volume over time measured in US Dollars and again this is split by the different wallet cohorts attention really comes in waves and currently we are rather high on that attention and unfortunately that's not good because there is a positive correlation between trading volume and price when trading volume is very low the price is low when trading volume is very high the price is high as well now here's the number of small holders over time now how is a small holder defined it's a wallet that has at least 10,000 mini tokens at the current price that's a bit over $700 again this comes in waves and have a look here at the bottom 13 14 15 of July we will come back to that in a second but here's something that I want to point out had your bought around that point when the momentum turned around you would now be up by more than 2600% so the number of retail wallets only Grows by a bit over 50 maybe around 60% and the price can go up that massively now let's check the larger wallet so that's now a 10x in minimum holding that's minimum roughly $7,000 worth of the token at current prices and we can see how the growth isn't as steady here's another 10x so that's now $70,000 worth of the token and here this goes pretty flat so the whales aren't really buying they aren't really selling or let's say at least the number of whales isn't really changing and so again here are all the charts side by side something happened around the 13 to 15 of July and I will show you what happened here in premium we've got various features one of them is our altcoin chats and we talk about how various people buy and sell and of course we're using onchain analytics for that now check this out paulo. bought some mini tokens at a price of 0.7 now we are not at 0.7 but we are at 7 cents so at 10x since then who is Paulo dool it's a very successful Trader that made 9 a half million with dog with head and another 7 million with Bowden and of course also another 6 million with Bon and so we are following Paulo dool we've got six of his wallets that give us signals like this right this is an automatically generated message from a wallet tracker and besides those six wallets we also have 419 other wallets of various influencers and various other successful Traders and so this is how I think we can get an edge in the market it's buying when trading volume is low and it's buying when the successful people the smart money is buying as well and so there's a link to premium down below it's the bitcoin.com there's also a link to the free telegram so the free telegram doesn't have all the features but still if your portfolio doesn't justify premium then that's the place to join looking very much forward to chatting

so that's 177% in the last month though we saw an appreciation of 50% now this is strange have a look at this chart this is the total value locked on the ontology chain this is measured in US dollars but even measured in entt tokens there is no positive momentum what whatever this is true both for the ontology chain but also for the ontology evm chain there's really no decentralized app that's interesting in any shape or form Wing Finance is available on five other chains I've used it it's a very standard boring and Landing platform without any real Innovation now we will dive into this in a bit more detail it doesn't look like the project is getting anywhere but the price suddenly is shooting up I think there is a potential opportunity here and again it's not because of fundamentals here a few more fundamentals this is the activity on GitHub on the developer platform how many code changes are really being made the last change 2 weeks ago another one 2 weeks ago one on November 23rd one on August 21st just based on that we can already see how antology isn't moving to any greener pastures the number of Reddit subscribers isn't growing the number of telegram users is even shrinking and so who's pushing up the price who's buying here actually in Agate I think it's the centralized exchanges and they might be doing this because of one reason check this out ontologies oent token distribution and lock periods a medium article we can see here that all of the ENT tokens have already unlocked so there's no more Supply expansion this is the circulating Supply over time that's great for centralized exchanges because they can simply hold the token and not worry about token d illusion in other words if the bances of this world were to hold the majority of the token and the token wouldn't be traded that much on a decentralized exchange anymore then they could open the floodgates to price manipulation again and maybe this will happen to some degree to on as well as it has happened for example for y Finance or as it is currently happening for Tor the trb token ontology is held on several chains but most holders are on the binance smart chain let's have a look at who's buying and who's selling the token this is a tool I have built myself that's available also for the premium members together with a tutorial video if you're interested in that feel free to check out the Bitcoin strategy.com link is down below here what this is showing is the number of holders that have at least 100 tokens on the left 1,000 tokens in the middle and 10,000 tokens on the right at the current price 100 tokens means $33 so pretty much small retail it's $330 in the middle it's $3,300 on the right notice there is only 76 such Wallets on chain and that's not even that much Capital we see a bit of accumulation Happening by the small guys less accumulation Happening by the medium-sized people and the Wales quote unquote didn't buy whatsoever in the last weeks and months and the reason why they didn't buy onchain is simply because there is no liquidity the largest liquidity pool for ontology is 57 $1,000 only so the trading is already very much concentrated in the centralized exchange hands here have a look at this table 40% of trading volume on binance alone another 11% on okx and the rest are all smaller centralized exchanges as well on top of that we've also got a derivatives Market binance of course leading here with a 24hour trading volume of 191 million so all almost every entt token because the market cap is 257 million has changed hands in the form of derivatives on binance in the last 24 hours alone so the price is already getting manipulated now the big question is how long can that manipulation continue if it continues for quite a while then the price of ENT could potentially double triple and even 4X from here whether or not that happens is 100% in the hands of those centralized exchanges and among them mainly in the hands of binance because there is a first glimmer of manipulation in ontology and because we have seen that much manipulation in trb and in un Finance for example I will be making a bet here I never buy or sell before releasing a video if I do a buy or sale in an asset that I'm talking about here on this YouTube channel I will be doing that transaction after releasing several hours after releasing and for this case here for ontology I will make a better I will buy some ENT again this is not based on fundamentals this is not because I believe this chain is going anywhere this is simply because I see a beginning of manipulation by binance and if this catches on this could potentially go much much higher if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down below",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv9RM4MkLH8,"['Bitcoin', 'JUST', 'Ontology',

now does it make sense to still jump on this rally who's actually triggering this R who's buying here is this small retail is this the Wales let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here are the top trending tokens on Solana and they are ordered by liquidity and moodang is one of the top performers among the largest tokens now this is not the first video on moodang on this channel I actually published three videos before this one now that first video didn't get initially that much traction but then with the price rise it started to pick up the subsequent video for the ethereum based moodang performed pretty poorly so that gives us a hint that retail interest into the ebased moodang isn't really that high the prices are not coupled so if you consider buying moodang don't pick the ethereum based one at least just based on those numbers the third video on moodang then finally took off this is always how it works with crypto and YouTube right once the investor base grows of course the video will also get more popularity unfortunately it's the best to buy when the token is still not that popular right that first video was published when mudang was still at 20 cents now it's at 62 cents and so even though the YouTube algorithm is against me even though if I publish videos on smaller tokens it might not get as many views I still think it's important it's important to provide enough value so feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various mem coins regularly here just have a look at this and compare how those tokens performed relative to the rest of the market now here is how I always start an analysis and I think it's a very good thing to do for everybody you don't need any fancy tooling simply go to dexc screen.com and look at this data over here first of all we see the price action today of course plus 45% but then we can also see what's behind that price action we see an overhang of 52% buyers versus 48% sellers but at the same time we see that the buying volume isn't that different to the selling volume there's only a Delta of roughly a million dollar in other words the sellers tend to have larger transactions than the buyers even though there are more buyers way more buyers if there wasn't that much profit taking the price would go up way more now let's have a look at what's going on on chain let's look into the details of those 53,000 holders now here's something I look at for pretty much any video on this channel and that's the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on a day and the number of transactions per day there's something very interesting happening since the 9th of November the number of firsttime Traders exceeds the number of recurring Traders again with it accelerating on the 13th of November now here is the 9th of November and here is the 13th of November this is something we very often see whenever new people enter the token the price subsequently tends to Rally in other words if there's more adoption by small retail the Wales notice this and they buy up even more now this trend continues so this is very very positive for the price at the same time we also see how the number of token transactions goes up so that's also another measure of attention grow growing which in turn means that the price can stabilize at a higher level and so here is how I see crypto crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more the capital overtime accumulates towards the people that are very skilled right the less important the luck component becomes thus once we see Wales buying more and more of a token that's a positive sign right the people that know how to play the game they accumulating thus the price is more likely to go up and so what we've got over here is the trading volume split up by different trade segments by different wallet sizes on the left side simply in US Dollars on the right side normalized to 100% per trading day and as so often we see attention coming in waves ideally you want to be selling when attention is at a peak and you want to be buying when attention is at a low currently we are building up attention again now we can ignore this latest data point over here because the day isn't yet over but what we can also see is that as a fraction of all of trading volume the larger wallets tend to make up more and more of trading small retail so the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token make up less and less now the numbers are a bit skewed because we do have centralized exchange listings of mooding so on the left side we see on chain the number of holders that have at least 2,000 mooding tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,200 in the middle we see the number of holders with 20,000 tokens so $112,000 worth of the token and on the right $120,000 worth of the token what happened over here it's a centralized exchange listing so some people move their mooding token over to the max Casas of this world and so what's better than just looking at these kind of graphs is to look at how many holders are there now relatively speaking in those different segments and we can see that over time the number of whales and the number of large retail wallets tended to go up there's less and less small retail wallets and of course this crash that we see over here is the listing again we see that over time even after the listing the whales tend to buy more and more now there's a common misconception most people think that currently the altcoins outperform everything else but that can't be further from the truth the altcoin market as a whole is actually underperforming have a look at this this is the others dominance this is the market cap of all altcoins that are not in the top 10 and this went down since beginning of the year by more than 30% at the same time the Bitcoin dominance went up so Bitcoin as a fraction of all of crypto becomes larger and larger the reason why it feels so different is because your probably already active in the segment of crypto that is outperforming now we can look at this in a more differentiated way but here are the different categories within crypto that performed the best in the last week number one is the zoo themed tokens number two is the pump. fun ecosystem now within the zoo themed tokens number one is Peanut which is also a pump. fun ecosystem token and number two is mooding and so it appears as if the Launchpad on Solana the mem coin Launchpad tend to do the best and within that Launchpad it's the zoo themed tokens because again both of those tokens come from pump. fun now here is another misconception most people think that buying and selling meme coins is simply just gambling it's just a matter of luck and that's true if you don't know what you're doing but there is a skill component to this we've already looked at the onchain analytics we've already looked at discovering who's currently driving the prices but what we can also do is we can dive even deeper we can track individual wallets and so have a look at this here this is an alert that influencer AI Lim bought the moodang token for 24 here's that influencer he's got 71,000 subscribers and again 24 cents isn't a bad entry given that we are up more than 160% since then I have a look at this this is the peanut token so the largest of the pump fun ecosystem tokens we've got a signal here that Crypt Benta bought peanut for 3 cents since then the price went up by more than 5,000 %. now here is the Cryptor Channel they've got more than a million subscribers and whenever they talk about a token of course attention goes up and with increased attention the price tends to go up as well and so the skill component in all of this is to find out what influencer owns what kind of wallet to then track those wallets and to then properly interpret those signals we've got 33 wallets by Crypt banter alone in total we track more than 400 wallets and so I really believe in the strategy I've made a tutorial section just on that topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we track them and how can we interpret the signals it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the bitcoins.com it's not just about wallet tracking right it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about portfolio diversification it's about back testing there's more than a 100 different videos in premium and so once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to update our on analytics Etc for that we've got individual altcoin chats within premium as well so if feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so can mudang go higher yes I believe it can because the smart money the Wales they continue to buy is it the very best upside I'm not sure because the market cap is already large I believe most upside is in the very very small coins if if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish you sely a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #spell #altcoins #crypto","the spell token is on a massive run but there is some data that's rather Insidious there is some data that doesn't look so nice let me show you what I mean now here's the rally we are up 37% today alone this month however we almost tripled what's causing this ready who is buying here who's selling here now this is the long-term price chart a clear destruction of capital here is the long-term market cap chart see how we can see the rally here a bit clearer on this chart compared to this chart the market cap Rose more relatively speaking than the price and that's because of token inflation there are still token inflation in the spell token more and more Supply hits the market depressing the price right now only half of spell tokens are circulating and here's the circulating Supply over time we went from a bit under 15 billion to more than 130 billion so the supply roughly at xed in the span of 3 years and that's then why we get chart like this this is the spell token relative to ethereum I like to look at relative valuations right because crypto in general goes up and down and expands and contracts and sometimes when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up then of course a lot of altcoins go up as well I want to know the outperformance longterm and that's what we see here this is spell divided by ethereum the relative performance and the massive token inflation of course did not help the price from top to bottom it went down by more than 95% relative to Eve if we take the last rally it's an underperformance of quotequote only 90% now let's talk about fundamentals for a second spell is the incentive Token for Magic internet money which is a stable coin that's not the prettiest stable coin but it allows for a lot of Leverage so this is the stable coin fluctuations in the last year we sometimes overshoot we sometimes undershoot we even see those fluctuations in the last month right a deack of like 4% or so a proper stable coin should be way closer to $1 but still people use it it because you can put leverage on top of Leverage on top of Leverage you can pretty much squeeze out the last little bit of performance in a position that you have high conviction in now magic internet money and spell is based on Abracadabra and Phantom used to be the largest chain for magic internet money this has changed because the main bridge that allowed capital inflows and outflows out of phantom it got hacked the money got lost somewhere in China and so now the main chain is ethereum it's $137 million of total value locked of capital in abbacadabra but at some point in time that was almost 7 billion so yes I do understand bare markets I do understand how Capital flows out of protocols in bare markets but not to that degree there might be some recovery recently but still right people got absolutely crushed and actually even the recovery is barely visible we're pretty much just going sideways and so all of that data backs the question why is the price Rising so so much of course we are in an ALT rally of course Bitcoin is close to alltime highs of course there is capital flowing into the system but why specifically spell why is spell outperforming the centeral question is who is buying here let's have a look on chain because this is what I like to do on this channel I like to look at retail investors versus whale investors I like to look at who is buying and this is a tool that I've developed myself and that I make available to the premium members so the link is down below Bitcoin trade.com feel free to check it out we have very long-term charts here and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least $1,000 worth of the spell token at the current prices so that's 700,000 tokens roughly this is what I'd consider retail on the ethereum Chain because any positions below $1,000 are pretty much not worth it because of the gas fees now in the middle we've got medium-sized retail that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token token all of those are very long-term charts all of those show very erratic Behavior not really long-term accumulation but we want to know what happened in the last month why did the price almost 3x and so let's have a look at the same charts but only for the last month the number of retail wallets did not grow the number of medium-sized retail even Shrunk the number of whales also pretty much is stable how can the price go up when nobody is buying on chain when the number of investors is not growing it must be the existing investors buying right or it must be people with very Deep Pockets buying it might be manipulation manipulation by whom I believe it's market makers or potentially even binance itself CU have a look at the following there's a strong misconception in crypto most people believe that decentralized exchanges only hold the tokens that their customers hold right they only hold them custody that's not true centralized exchanges also hold tokens for Market Mak making and when a token crushed that much then maybe it's possible to generate some kind of attention with a price rally and then sell some of that off have a look at this most trading volume happens on binance now pretty much 40% of all of trading volume in the last 24 hours was there and on top of that we've also got a Perpetual Futures market so those are derivative contracts those are bets on the price so on the one hand you own a lot of the token on the other hand you also offer bets on the token price you own the referee and you offer the bets that's how crypto works this is how manipulation is born binance makes money from liquidations of course and so when a lot of people bet on Rising prices they crash the price and vice versa and so can this really continue yes of course it can but it's not in the hand of the broad masses it's in the hand of a few key people at binance this is not broad adoption otherwise we would see this on chain as well we don't see the number of investors going up even though the price almost tripled if it's a time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also free telegram link is down

figure out if this is actually a Hidden Gem in the memec coin world now what we've got over here is the etherium chain and we are ordering the trending tokens by their liquidity pool size and over here we've got the msdr 2100 token at place number 33 $2 million worth of liquidity now that's on Unis swap V2 we've also got a secondary pool on Unis swap V3 so in total it adds up to roughly 2 and A2 million and so of course the interesting thing is always the price performance and it had been pretty good but is this another pump and dump since launch 1 month ago we went up by more than 5,000% but in the meantime we've also seen a dump of more than 80% is this going to repeat we are not going to find the answer on the website we want to look at data most most people aren't looking at we're going to look at things that people don't consider we look at the number of buyers and sellers at the number of whales and Retail investors at the activity in general the things that aren't that obvious in the price data now mstr 2100 is a derivative of SPX 16900 and that token went absolutely Bonkers it went up by more than 24,000 per. it's currently at 90s and we talked about that token when it was still at 11 cents so I try to be early on this channel I publish videos on Meme coins regularly feel Fe to subscribe to not miss the next one now back to msdr 2100 what's the potential upside the market cap is currently at 50 million now that's not too bad it's not super small it's not super big there are plenty of meme coins that are 2 3 4X larger with a 5x it would be close to the MIT mem coin with a 6X it would get close to pcoin and with a 10x we would be slightly be in frog which by the way we also covered early on this channel and so a market cap of 50 million is pretty much in The Sweet Spot when we look at the top performing meme coins in the last 7 days then we mainly see tokens in that area we've got Sigma that more than doubled so before it doubled it was at around 50 million we've got lock in it also doubled it also was at around 50 million before that Etc it's the 50 to maximum $100 million mark that I believe is the most interesting for meme coins and this is currently where mstr 6900 is currently at now let's start with the onchain metrix let's try to figure out how much longer this really can last or if there's some danger that we could see another 80% drop so on chain we've got a bit over 6,000 holders on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 8,000 followers in telegram we've got 5,000 members so all of those numbers somewhat align it seems like there's no obvious manipulation here but what about about attention how is that developing let's have a look at the number of returning Traders versus new Traders because if a lot of new Traders come into a token the price tends to appreciate and so we see that on the left side we see that on token launch there was of course a lot of new users we then see 3 days afterwards another influx of new users but since then we tend to rather Trend downwards so that's not only in the number of new users it's also in the relationship of new users to returning users over time but it seems like we at somewhat of an equilibrium now still 84% of trading happens by already existing users in the token what's not declining as quickly is the trading volume and what's also good is that the number of buyers tends to be higher than the number of sellers on a day in other words the returning users that we always see they tend to Simply dollar cost average into the token so on the left side we see the number of daily buyers and sellers and on the right side that's normalized to 100% And We tend to be hovering at around 55% buyers versus 40 5% Sellers and so who's currently driving the rally it seems to be the big money it does not seem to be a lot of retail investors because let's have a look at the number of small wallets versus big wallets so on the left side we see the number of wallets with at least 500 mstr tokens at the current price that's a bit over $11,000 for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in memo holding so that's now 5,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right chart another 10x so that's now $100,000 worth of the token we can see how the growth seems to have stalled at around the 17th of October so that was over here we still saw a subsequent correction not necessarily surprising but then somewhat surprising we've seen the price shoot up by 150% again what appears to be happening is that the current holders of MST are simply buying more of the token even today we see almost the same number of buyers versus sellers yet the price is going up by 177% and so it's not necessarily that obvious how to time this token right we don't necessarily know what's happening in the heads of those whales that being said what I like to do is I like to track individual whales I like to track people that tend to make the right calls in the past I like to track people that influence markets that have a big following on YouTube for example and so with that wallet tracking because the blockchain is an open Ledger right we can see what kind of wallets buy and sell what we got a notification that House of crypto bought mstr on the 31st of October for $4,500 and then just a few days afterwards sold it for 6,600 so a Clean Gain of roughly 50% in a matter of less than a week here's that influencer that we're tracking but we don't just track him right we track others as well we track Kaio chesse for example he bought the goat token and that was on the 14th of October for 13 cents now we are at 80 cents up almost 500% or check out this signal this is frog bought on the day of launch up more than 3,300 since then so here is that influencer we are tracking 12 of his wallets we track in total more than 400 wallets that all happens in the premium membership of this channel so that's down below the bitcoin.com there's even an entire tutorial video course on how to track influencer wallets how to find the wallets in the first place how to then track them how to afterwards also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking so that course has eight video feel free to check it out there's more than a 100 different videos in premium in total also on onchain analytics Etc the things we have looked at at the beginning of this video and so we then discuss our wallet findings in separate channels and of course we also discuss the trading signals that we get from those wallets in dedicated altcoin chats so feel free to check it out it's $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so there's zero risk for you in case you do not like premium just message me within the first week and I'll refr you 100% and so I believe that mstr 2100 is somewhat of a dangerous game right now we don't necessarily see the adoption by retail anymore I personally look for the next opportunity if you got some value out this video feel free to

people aren't considering to determine what's the better place to park the money what are retail investors buying and selling what are the whales the potentially smart money what are they buying and selling let's dive deeper today we are up 14% for Pepe this week we are up by almost 50% and this year we almost 30X since listing on coin Market cap roughly one year ago the price of Pepe increased by more than 13,000 per. now what's the reason for the price Val today it's a listing of Pep Perpetual Futures on coinbase now before we look at Pepe coin let's first look at the onchain data of Pepe itself let's see who's buying who's selling what is the long-term development what you've got over here are three holder graphs on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 125 million P tokens roughly so that's around $1,000 at current prices we saw a lot of purchasing up until the beginning of May of 2023 then we saw mainly selling so this is where retail bought in this is where retail also sold but then we had our nice secondary rally in the middle we've got the mediumsized holder so that's now 1.25 billion tokens so roughly $10,000 a very similar holding pattern and on the right we've got the Wales another 10x so that's now $100,000 worth of the token see how retail actually sold much less relative to the Wales so there's maybe only a third or so of the Wales still in the token while there's 70% or so of retail still in there so most of that long-term decline was triggered by the Wales however the recent trading volume Spike with the recent rally here we can't really see that on chain the number of holders isn't really picking up on chain when we look at the last month where we went pretty much sideways we see that the number of holders r rather tended to go up so that's now the same kind of charts that we've seen before but only for the last 30 days what's going on here the centralized exchanges have taken over check this out this is where you now buy and sell Pepe most of the trading volume happens on binance and there's even more trading volume on the binance Futures markets binance holds a lot of Pepe and at the same time they offer bets on the price as well so that's like a sports betting house that allows you to bet on the outcome of the game but at the same time they also bought the referee not everything that is being held by binance here is customer funds a lot of this is also for Market making or dare I say it Market manipulation because again on chain there's really pretty much nothing happening now this rally in March was 100% driven by binance now Pepe coin is very very different Pepe coin is still mainly Trad in a decentralized manner so we do have more transparent data what's actually going on centralized exchanges unfortunately are a black box we don't really know what the whales are doing we don't really know what retail is doing so have a look at this that's pcoin 42% is done on Unis swap V2 18% is done on Unis swap wi3 there is a bit of involvement by Mexi and bitat but it really doesn't move the needle that much and so today Pepe coin isn't doing too great however this month it outperformed the regular Pepe Pepe itself went up by 5.9% peper coin went up by 177% how about this year also a strong outperformance pep coin more than 8,000% in gains the regular Pepe quote unquote only 2,700 a bit less than that and that's of course not surprising because Pepe is way larger than Pepe coin the larger a cryptocurrency gets the more market cap it has the less upside potential there is with each doubling it takes more and more money and more and more people to double the price yet again have a look at the same charts for Pepe coin on the left side the number of wallets at at least 200 tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 in the middle we've got a 10 X from that so that's now a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right side we've got the Wales a minimum holding of $100,000 just have a look at how heavily the whals have sold off there's only 59 whale wallets left and at some point we were at 460 whale wallets here are the same charts just for the last month the number of regular retail investors grew by 20% medium-sized retail went down by a bit less than 10% and the whales went down massively and still the price was doing somewhat okay it's actually surprising considering that those wallets here are 100 times more important than those wallets over here right this is always a 10x minimum holding from one chart to the next usually a chart where we see the whales selling that much is very dangerous but this time I'm not so sure because now we've only got 60 whales left right there isn't that much anymore in the massive hands in the heavy weights that can manipulate the price now at some point retail might be taking over and so this is the most important thing to watch right will the number of retail investors continue to grow because at this pace the Wales will be at zero in 3 months and I don't believe that every single whale will sell the number of medium-sized holders is very erratic it's going up and down a lot and so if retail can really take over then maybe we will see a continued outperformance of Pepe coin versus the regular Pepe especially given that the market cap is only roughly 1 of the original Pepe so something might happen to Pepe coin the same way it happened to Pepe a listing on a centralized exchange might get announced pushing up the price that's another Catalyst we can't see for the original Pepe anymore the original Pepe is simply already very large if it's the first time here feel free to subscribe I this regularly like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got

exhausted or is it just the silence before the storm now in this video we are going to look at relative valuation charts yet one more time most people just look at the US dollar charts I think it's better to look at opportunity costs how is Dogecoin performing to the rest because especially with memec coin trading it's all about outperformance it's all about a player versus player game of course when Bitcoin goes up everything else goes up as well including Dogecoin where Bitcoin goes down Dogecoin goes down as well but what's the relative performance when does Dogecoin go up when Bitcoin doesn't now this is the Dogecoin US dollar chart that's what everybody is looking at and since the peak on the 12th of November we went down by roughly 15% and so some people make the argument that Dogecoin didn't go up because Bitcoin didn't either and that is true to a degree this is the Bitcoin US dollar chart and that peaked at 23,000 and now we are down by 2 half% and so here is then the problem right Dogecoin did worse compared to bitcoin but how did it do compared to the rest of crypto how do it do compared to other altcoins and the main question is does it make sense to buy this dip now what we've got over here is another type of Dogecoin chart this is the Dogecoin dominance so this looks at the entire cryptocurrency market cap all of cryptocurrencies combined and it looks at how is the market cap comparing of Dogecoin to all of the rest so how important is Dogecoin in the grand scheme of things of all of crypto and this peaked on the 12th of November at 8:00 at roughly 2.1% so 2.1% of all of crypto was Dogecoin it's now down to 1.8% the relative decline is 15% now here's another argument the argument could be made that Dogecoin is simply just a levered bet on bitcoin right when Bitcoin goes up a little bit then Dogecoin goes up much more and vice versa when Bitcoin goes down a little bit then Dogecoin is expected to go down more now this this argument would work if Dogecoin is stable against the other altcoins now Dogecoin is one of the largest altcoins so it should actually be less risky than the other altcoins if the market isn't doing that well then Dogecoin should actually fall less compared to the smaller altcoins it might fall more than Bitcoin but it should fall less compared to all the other alss now here is what happened with those other alls during that time it first went down then it went up now the others dominance is 1% higher so it went from 9.5 to 9.6 % this chart here measures how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not the top 10 so the smaller altcoins even outperformed slightly while the Dogecoin dominance went down quite massively and those kinds of things are important right they show us the relative movements within crypto they show us where capital is currently flowing where the attention is currently flowing we can't see developments like this by just looking at the price chart we have to go beyond this and so here is the scary chart this is the chart that I show showed already in Prior videos on this channel it again shows the Dogecoin dominance but this time we zoom out quite a lot we've got almost 4 years of data in here and at one point the do dominance was at 3.8% then it fell down then it climbed again it fell down it climbs again back down and now we are high to very very similar levels to November of 2022 now one could make the argument that we simply just relive history and we could see something like this is it going to play out one-on-one like this I'm not sure but there's definitely a chance one thing to always look at is trading volume that's those lines here at the bottom whenever trading volume is high we have to be careful because that means that attenion is high whenever trading volume is low it's potentially a better time to buy and so we can see over here for example in March of 2024 we went very quickly up in Dogecoin trading volume also went up then as trading volume came back down the price also came back to normality now we obviously very very heated in trading volume so attention is high many people look at Dogecoin everybody that considers buying has probably already bought now things aren't necessarily that straightforward because there's still the chance of a short squeeze if enough people now bet on this outcome on the falling price and the short interest gets high enough then some Wales might simply push up the price to liquidate those shorts now the short squee risk or the risk of a sudden price R because a lot of people bet on falling prices is higher the smaller the market cap of a token is because then a lot of people can simply squeeze the bigger the market cap of an asset is the less likely a short squeeze becomes now here is the Dogecoin market cap it's at 54 billion with a B it takes a lot of money to induce a short squeeze I think the likelihood of that happening is rather small and this also gives us a potential upside is it likely that Dogecoin is going to 3x from here is it likely that it's going to reach $1 if that was the case the market cap would reach 150 billion Dogecoin would be larger than Solana Dogecoin would be larger than tether and it would be half the size of ethereum Solana has a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 7 billion is Dogecoin really worth more than that I'd go so far to say that the current price is already very much inflated because is it Justified that Dogecoin has a larger market cap than the second largest stable coin usdc I've got my strong doubts now even within the category of meme coins Dogecoin is already very very high again we are at 54 billion but number two is less than 1/3 the size number three is roughly 1/8 the size and bonk the largest meme coin on Solana it's a bit above 120th of the size of Dogecoin now don't get me wrong I do believe that the crypto Market as a whole is currently expanding we can see this for example from the stable coin market caps so this is over time how the stable coin market cap has developed for various Stables like d USD usdc BD Etc we add this all up and we see a very nice crash when Terra Luna collapsed we see a secondary crash when FTX collapsed and then we've seen a turn around in October of last year this is when crypto started to expand again and this expansion is now accelerating so there are conversions from Fiat into the crypto World more people buy various tokens and of course this could stabilize the Dogecoin price but stabilization at the current level isn't necessarily what we want during a time like this right we want to get the upside it's all about generating outperformance and we generate outperformance by looking at the hot areas in crypto and it's not just the memec coin Market that's doing well it's specifically the meme coins on Solana in the pump. fun ecosystem that are doing well because check this out this is an overview of the top performing meme coins in the last 7 days and this is across all chains across all ecosystems and only one single meme coin here kinu that's on the binance smart chain all the other token are pump. fun ecosystem tokens on Solana the number of deployed contracts on pump. fun is at an all-time high and the fraction of the trading volume that pump. fund occupies within Solana continues to grow it's now at 43% and so the real question is how can we find those kind of tokens early how can we find tokens that do still have the potential to 10x I don't think it's possible that Dogecoin relatively speaking is going to 10x but there are plenty of meme coins that definitely can for example look at this the largest of the tokens mentioned over here the peanut token it went up by more than 1,000% in the last week and it's now at 1.7 billion it's still way smaller than Dogecoin but it's the largest of the pump. fund tokens now how can we find something like this before it does its th% returns I believe the answer to this question is wallet tracking this is how I approach this right the blockchain is 100% transparent we can see who is buying who is selling once we've got the wallets we can monitor them and so that's what I like doing have a look at this this is an alert about the peanut token how crypto benter bought peanut for 3 cents since that purchase the price went up by more than 5,000% now why did this happen it happened because the smart money bought in right the Insiders bought in the people bought in that move markets here this is Crypt banter it's one of the largest crypto channels on YouTube they've got 1.1 million subscribers and through analytics of the blockchain we found out some of their wallets so we are now tracking 33 wallets by Crypt banter we're tracking in total more than 400 wallets so for example we've also got wallets by Alex Becker he's got 1.48 million subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets and I really believe this is what distinguishes the winners from the losers in crypto it's finding out what the Insiders are doing it's being with the smart money the smart money wins crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more it's played the more trading happens the more the capital concentrates towards the skilled people and so I like the strategy so much that I have built a dedicated tutorial cost just on wallet tracking so it's eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets how to then subsequently track them and how to finally also interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of Premium the link is down below the Bitcoin stay.com but the premium membership is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk management it's also about back testing there's more than a 100 videos in total and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to look at relative valuations Etc that's why we've got the dedicated Chets on the individual alt coins in premium as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so can Dogecoin climb further possibly if the overall Market is going up will Dogecoin outperform the other meme coins probably not I believe it's already too large if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I probably regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow

look at soy objectively we're going to look at data that you will not see in other videos what's obviously nice is the current momentum we are up more than 100% just in the last month alone what's also nice is that Su scan provides a lot of data direct onchain data of the usage of the chain now unfortunately a lot of that data is very very volatile for example this this is the number of new accounts this chart starts in April of last year and sometimes we've got spikes even Beyond 10,000 new accounts in a day then we've got other days where we are down to very very low levels like 166 new accounts in a day very similar erratic movements can be seen in the number of active accounts and in the number of daily transactions as well now the number of new coins being deployed is a bit less erratic it's not a huge number but it tends to grow somewhat consistently now why are we looking at that data in the first place the idea is to get an estimate of what is demand versus supply of course we can look at Supply and we will we're going to look at how much is Supply expanding in the future but for demand we want to get a feeling of how much usage is there for the blockchain is there more and more adoption by more and more people is there more and more Capital that's being attracted to so potentially pushing up the assets of that ecosystem now there is a chart with much less erratic movements and that's the total value locked on SOI that's from defi Lama and that went from 36 million in May of last year all the way to 285 million today now one might argue of course the total value lock goes up when the price of so itself goes up but that's not the entire story because you can look at this chart not just in US dollars but also denominated in soy tokens and this also goes up this is very very positive now what what's causing that rally it's mainly two applications it's the na'vi protocol and its flow X Finance now it's important that this growth here is larger than the price growth so the price growth was 115% in the last month the total value locked growth of those two protocols was more than that so this number is denominated in US Dollars and you want to see growth here that shows an inflow of capital not just an appreciation of the capital that's already in the protocol so here's the na'vi protocol and this might be a reason why there's so much inflows look at this 20% apy plus some extra for depositing tether and usdc if you're bullish on the soy token itself you can also deposit that and yet a very similar return so more than 40 million just in stable coins another 40 million in Native SOI locked here other protocol is flow X Finance you can stake the flx token over here and get a 775 APR on that here's the performance of flx relative to so for whatever reason there was a massive Spike on the 2nd of December but since then you're pretty much stable against soy if not even appreciating this might not work forever but right now the party is still going the music is still playing now this looks all positive what's the negatives potentially here right I try to be as objective as possible I'm not just a shilling channel that tries to Market any kind of tokens I'm here to show both sides and the issue potentially could be the expanding Supply have a look at this this is token. unlocks do app and this is the page specifically for SOI right now we've got roughly 1 billion SOI tokens floating one year from now this will 3x with massive Cliff unlocks happening in May June and July this is not a problem right now but it can become a problem in the future the question is will there be enough people that bet on falling prices of SOI at the time if that is the case then potentially the centralized exchanges could even bet against this buy up a lot of soy despite the unlock and push up the price essentially liquidating all the short sellers so just because there is a token unlock does not necessarily mean that the price has to instantly depress there can be some manipulation against this and so is pretty strongly in the hands of centralized exchanges I do expect though that the ups and downs in the price the volatility is likely going to increase and so a lot of trading is currently on binance on okx on bybit on coinbase on qoin gate IO is part of the party as well it's not only on the spot Market

Analysis, Opus Review, Opus Price, Opus Price Prediction, Opus longterm, Opus Tokenomics,   #opus #altcoin #crypto","the oppos token on Solana launched bya the pump. fun ecosystem is on a massive run what's causing this who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look behind the price action to figure out whether or not it still makes sense to buy oppos right now now we're currently at roughly 7 cents we are up 16% in the last 24 hours alone and in the last week we pretty much 5x have a look at this overview in the pump. fun ecosystem the Oppo San is an absolute top performer currently at 70 million market cap roughly now there are pump. fun ecosystem tokens that are way larger than this and I believe that's a good sign because that means there is some upside potential still 70 million in market cap compares to 1,273 million for the largest of the pump. fund ecosystem tokens so that's almost a 20x from here there's plenty of tokens that are smaller than 70 million a 2X would put lotos in the area of loose a 3X would put it just above bully but still below fcoin by the way we talked about fcoin very very early on this channel so feel free to check out the history now here are the trending tokens on the Solana chain ordered by their liquidity pool size and of course we've got peanut act and goat in the top positions and opos is currently at number 13 with a liquidity pool of 2.7 million currently there's roughly 1,500 more buyers than sellers so that's a ratio of 54 4% buyers versus 46% Sellers and before we go into the onchain analytics so the number of buyers and sellers and the retail investors and the whale investors etc those kinds of Trends let's first have a look at the social metrics because sometimes it's possible to spot some kind of manipulation over there now here's the Twitter account of Opus or some call it the xplatform there is 6,4 followers over here there's also the oppos community with 3,900 followers that compares to 3 ,200 members on telegram so the same kind of Ballpark and that in turn compares to 12,700 holders on chain so this all kind of makes sense most of the time we see more holders on chain than followers on the social metrics it also makes sense that those are all in the same kind of order of magnitude right it's not like there is 10 times more followers on Twitter compared to say holders on chain this all makes sense here but let's dive a bit deeper into the onchain metrics what we see on the left is the number of First Time versus recurring Traders per day and what we see on the right is the number of token transactions now it's interesting how the number of token transactions spiked up much more comparatively speaking in relation to the number of Traders right of course the Traders were also low but the token transactions were way way lower relatively speaking we've seen a massive influx of first-time Traders 9,895 on a single day and we can ignore the latest data point because today has just started and we might see yet another all-time high yes I believe one of the most useful charts for Opus and that's the trading volume on the left side that's in US Dollars on the right side that's normalized to 100% per day and of course we do again see this massive Spike yesterday but here's what I like so much about those two sharts on the right side we can clearly see how the trading volume by small retail tends to decline over time and how the trading volume by the Wales and large retail tends to go up over time now small retail is all the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to $10,000 large retail is up to $100,000 and Wales is everything above $100,000 and so instead of looking at the trading volume we can also have a look at the number of holders and instead of looking at US Dollars we can have a look at the number of tokens so there are different holding thresholds based on different token levels on the left side each of those wallets here has at least 20,000 oppos tokens now at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 and I consider this retail in the middle we go a X in minimum holding so it's now not $11,000 but $110,000 and on the right it's $100,000 so another 10x so on the right are the Wales on the left is retail and in the middle is something in between and so we can clearly see how the number of retail investors tends to grow over time we see a bit less growth by medium-sized retail and we see how the very large whales tend to simply just stay stable over time now this is the number of Wales this is not the token ownership by the Wales because again right we have seen how the trading volume interesting enough went down comparatively speaking over time very consistently have a look at this who owns the token ownership relatively speaking it's less and less retail over time it's now only 2.4% of all tokens held by small retail and only 11% by mediumsized retail so that's all the wallets up to $10,000 all the other tokens right now so pretty much 85% of the supply is now held by wallets that have at least $10,000 worth of the token we can also see this in the accumulation charts the value that is held by small retail may be 3 to 4X in the last month but the value of the tokens held by the Wales did not just 3 to 4X that went up by 100x now here's a very interesting recent development you very likely do not have access to this kind of chart this here shows how much advertisers on my YouTube channel pay for 1,000 views of their ads and it's suddenly out of nothing spiked to roughly double of what it used to be in other words crypto projects centralized exchanges Etc they are now competing for advertising space in the crypto scene and it's not just money that's flowing into advertising for crypto there's also simply Fiat money that's flowing into the space as a whole the stable coin market cap tends to rise and it's recently even accelerating so since October of last year we see money flowing into crypto again that of course causes a lot of crypto asset prices to go up and especially in the recent days since since beginning of the month we also see the alt coins going up in aggregate so what we have over here is the others dominance this is how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 that went up by roughly 20% in the last month and so pretty much everything is now going up the art in crypto trading though is to buy early right it's to buy when the prices are still low so for example over here the chill guy token it's now at 50 cents but I made a video on chill guy when it was still at 20 cents and I hope a lot of of you made money with that video because it was a quite popular one and so this is the real art right we have to get into tokens when momentum is bullish and when there's still enough upside potential and so this is what this channel is all about right it's about discussing tokens that a lot of people don't yet have on their radar so feel free to subscribe now how can I find tokens like chill guy early how can I find things like the goat token or the ACT token early those are one of the largest pump. fun ecosystem tokens this is a wallet tracking alert how Kyle chesse bought the gold token for 14 cents that was over here since then the price went up by more than 500% temporarily it was up by more than 800% who's KY chesse it's this influencer over here he's got 137,000 subscribers and he tends to be relatively early on trending tokens and so here is how that works we use onchain analytics again to figure out who is owning what wallet it's not a very easy task but we've got an entire community that just focuses on that single task find wallets that are very useful of insiders of top traders of influencers let's find those wallets and then track them so over here we've got the wallets that we Track by Kyle chesse we've got 12 in total well let's talk about the ACT token here's our signal for ACT Crypt bentor bought the ACT token at 3.7 now it's at 58 so an increase of 1,500% since that signal and of course temporarily the gain was even higher more than 2,000% now where do crazy gains like this come from they come from attention they come from a lot of eyeballs getting into one single token and so here are those eyeballs this is the Crypt Channel they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token of course the token has to go up and so we've got 33 of Crypt bter wallets and so really I think this is the better approach compared to just drawing random lines on price charts I think it's better to follow the smart money it's better to follow the Insiders it's better to Simply copy trade the people that tend to make money in crypto and I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on this how can we find various influencer wallets how can we track those wallets and how can we subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total it's all part of Premium so that's down below the Bitcoin tray.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about portfolio diversification risk management indicator back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we get our wallet signals we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare the onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual all coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything simply just message me within the first s days and I'll refr you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so here is what I believe is going on with the Opus token initially there was silent accumulation by the Wales with not that much price action now it seems like the Wales feel comfortable pushing up the price and they buy a bit faster are they buying faster now in order to generate a lot of attention to subsequently dump it or are they buying faster now in order to get more and more people in to get to a certain holding threshold to get to a certain market cap that then subsequently a centralized exchange might list a token there's many potential explanations I think it's very important to see what happens during bearish days when overall the market is rather trending downwards will opos stay stable because the Wales continue buying or will opos completely crash if the letter is the case then of course it doesn't make sense to keep on holding right then it's probably some kind of pump and dump I think the risk to reward is currently worth it for oppos and so I'm considering to buy some tokens as well I haven't bought any yet because I never want to buy before publishing a video I always publish a video first and then subsequently buy if there is a case where I buy beforehand I will also announce this here in the video I really don't like this conflict of interest I try to minimize this as much as possible I don't like how a lot of influencers Simply buy a token secretly and then promote it on YouTube this channel is not that if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

#vvaifu #crypto","Dasha terminal with the Wu token is one of the best performing token since launch on Solana now we see a dip we are down almost 50% does it make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at some onchain analytics that most people aren't looking at let's also try to estimate the potential upside because Dasha is imitating a concept that's already very successful on the base chain now since listing on coin market cap the token is up by roughly 3x but the real gains are to be made early before listing even on coin market cap since trading began on the Solana chain we are up more than 5,000% and so Dasha is now at place number 12 in terms of liquidity among the trending tokens on Solana the platform is a Launchpad for AI agents and if you've been around in crypto recently you know another launch pad you might have heard of the virtual protocol the second largest trending token on the base chain it's got almost 30 million in liquidity and it launched for example the Luna token Luna in itself has already 4 million liquidity now let's make a back of the envelope calculation let's see how big Solana is relative to base and let's see how big the virtual protocol is and let's see how high then potentially the Dasha token could go so Solana has roughly 2 and a half times the total value locked of Base in terms of trading volume it's roughly five times as large so let's just roughly average those two numbers let's say Solana is four times three to four times larger than Bas if you now take the market cap of virtual product protol which is on base and we multiply this with a factor of four we get to a market cap of a similar platform on Solana of maybe 800 million currently the Wu token has a market cap of 130 million roughly so we looking at a potential maybe 7x from here which would then we rounding a lot here put the price at roughly $1 now let's have a look if this rally over here this is the linear scale if this was natural and organic or if this was manipulation let's compare social metrics so on the xplatform on Twitter we've got 4,000 followers in telegram we've got 3,000 members on chain we've got 12,000 holders so those numbers kind of align they kind of make sense it's not like the number of Twitter followers is 10 times the number of holders on chain there's no manipulation on that front now let's dive deeper into the on analytics and let's try to find out what actually those 12,000 holders are what we've got on the left is the number of recurring Traders over time what we've got on the right is the number of token transactions over time and we can see a very nice growth happening in two waves what's interesting is that the second wave over here was not as large for the user account compared to the number of transactions what we're seeing over here is the trading volume and we've got this in two forms on the left side is the trading volume just measured in US Dollars on the right side is a trading volume same kind of trading volume but just normalized to 100% per day and again we see our two waves again we see that the second wave was much larger and what we also notice is a clear Trend in terms of the trading volume based on the different segments now what are those segments small retail is all the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium-size retail is up to $110,000 large retail is up to $100,000 and Wales is above $100,000 so the trading volume gets more and more dominated by the big guys now instead of looking at the segregation in terms of US Dollars we can also look at this in terms of the number of tokens right because the price went up this might distort the picture on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 10,000 wot tokens for the chart in the middle we go a 10x in minimum holding so 100,000 tokens for the chart on the right another 10x so a million tokens since the price is currently a bit over 10 cents we can approximate this with $1,000 $110,000 $100,000 worth of the token roughly so this is small retail this is the big Wales we see very nice accumulation by small retail we see more more retail wallets getting into the token this is exactly what we want to see we want to see organic growth the number of small retail wallets has almost tripled in the last 3 to 4 days mediumsized retail has also grown quite a bit not as much but still it almost doubled in the last few days and the number of whales is pretty much constant now just because the number of Wales is constant doesn't mean that the whales aren't dominating the price more because it seems like the Wales are dollar cost averaging into the token just have a look at this most Supply is now owned by the Wales it's 77% of all of Supply only 1% of Supply is held by wallets with less than $1,000 worth of the token now I very much like a trend like this it seems like the number of Weights is flat but the token ownership moves towards the whales the whales tend to make the better calls right crypto is both a game of luck and skill the more the game is played the more the money flows towards the skilled people thus when the whales own a lot of the token that's a good sign now the question is always about how can we find tokens early before they go up for example over here right this is the pump. fun ecosystem so the launch pad of meme coins on Solana it's the second best performing crypto category in all of crypto in the last week and here are the individual tokens and the best performing token in the last week within that ecosystem is Dasha waiu let's have a look at the largest pump. fun ecosystem tokens here the best performers were peanut and comedian ban now I published videos on both tokens early on this channel and I analyze meme coins regularly over here so if you want to be early feel free to subscribe over here potentially even hit the notifications because sometimes the YouTube algorithm can be pretty slow and so here's how we can find those tokens early have a look at this this is the peanut token which was bought at 3 Cents by Crypt now here's the crypto channel of Crypt they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token it generates attention and the price tends to go up and so here are the wallets that we found again through onent analytics by Crypt Benta it's 33 wallets just for this individual YouTube channel in total we track more than 400 wallets and so I really believe that crypto Trading is not just luck of course there is a luck component involved but it also has a lot of skill if we follow the people that move markets if we follow the people that tend to make profit we tend to also copy their returns and because of that I made a tutorial section just on wallet tracking how can we find individual influencer wallets how can we then track those wallets and how can we subsequently interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of Premium the link is down below the Bitcoin tray.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about back testing it's also about risk management and portfolio diversification there's more than 100 videos in total once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to compare different analytics that's why we've got our dedicated altcoin chats as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first seven days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I'm quite bullish on the dashup platform I believe that the wo token can potentially make a 7x if it reaches similar Heights to the virtual protocol I personally don't own any tokens yet but I am considering to buy some after releasing of this video if you got some value video feel free to subscribe I prly a like would be very much appreciated as well see you in the next video or see you in premium

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #trias #altcoin #crypto","Trias is it that Hidden Gem in the cryptocurrency world there are some things I really really love about the token and others I incredibly hate and I will share both of those things here the first thing to like is obviously this rally more than a 10x last year most of it happened in the last month now things didn't always look that Rosy during the bare Market the price went from $24 all the way down to less than $1 but here's the first interesting thing this is the price chart but have a look at the corresponding market cap chart trius was never that large in terms of market cap so the circulating supply seems to have grown over time I was not able to find a reliable circulating Supply chart though but I will show you the data I got from my own tools here's something interesting the token isn't yet that widely spread across centralized exchanges qoin has the major share of trading but there's still massive trading happening also in a decentralized manner and that's good it's good that we've got activity on the blockchain directly because then we can see what are the small holders doing what are the whales doing what's actually moving that price now here's something embarrassing for the Trias team they announced just recently a launch of a new website on December 30th Trias do1 you click on that link and what do you see as you see there is nothing the website went down the person responsible for that new website probably took a holiday break and didn't bother to fix this now any YouTuber can show you the broken website any YouTuber can show you the price chart this video though has data that other YouTubers will not show you we'll find out who is currently buying the token is it small retail or is it Wales the answer is in the charts behind me a tool that I've built myself that you can get access to as well in the premium membership so that's the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below as well on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 10 Trea tokens but it's currently $150 worth of the token so small retail with a bit of play money in it in the middle we've got the number of holders that have 10 times that 100 tokens so that's $1,500 worth of the token another 10x on the right ,000 tokens so $115,000 worth of the token currently there are roughly ,000 holders and this is a bit over the top 10% of those holders what do we see we see retail is buying massively both small retail and medium-sized retail we also see that the whales purchase quite heavily at the beginning they aren't participating in the current rally that much but they're also not selling off so we've seen a 10x in price in the last year most of it happening in the last month and the big big guys are not letting go of their tokens at least in aggregate now there's a very confusing situation around the circulating Supply and if you've got an answer to this please comment this down below I will show you what I have here first of all coin market cap implies an increase in circulating Supply right otherwise the market cap wouldn't be at all-time highs while the price is not on top of that we see a total supply of 10 million with a circulating supply of 9.7 million now my onchain tool shows a minted supply of 10 million so this is in line with what coin Market cap says but it's not increasing whatsoever right this was always 10 million another very interesting point is when we look at the largest holders that's over here the largest wallet has 5 million tokens and that wallet is a burner wallet it's a debt wallet so of those 10 million at least 5 million are not accessible anymore so what is it is it a growing Supply as implied by the market cap chart of coin market cap is it a constant supply of 10 million at as implied by the onchain minting events or is it even 5 million of circulating Supply with half of the tokens already being burned since they are held in a dead wallet if you know what's going on here feel free to share this again down below in the comments it will help the entire Community that's looking for Trias now here's another thing I very much like and that's the chart behind me this is Trias relative to ethereum I don't like to look at altcoin charts just in bare US dollars because you want to know how much outperformance are you getting for taking on more risk and ethereum tends to be higher correlat to altcoins than Bitcoin is and Trias did outperform versus Eve by 1, 250% roughly this is very very positive over such a long period of time most altcoins do not outperform e so there's two ways to interpret this right on the one hand there's potentially an upper ceiling here because we did see a crash at that level in the past but I rather see this as a positive I don't think we have to necessarily bounce off that potential resistance and the reason for that is the small market cap 150 million fully diluted but very likely it's just half of the size really because again all of that dead Supply there's lots of other useful information in this tool for example the first wallets that received the token or the first wallets that traded the token those might be potential insiders and it's always interesting to see what are those wallets actually doing with the token now so again

anywhere else we are going to look at toomics we're going to look at onchain data we're going to look at who's buying and who's selling because some pretty smart heavyweights seem to be buying here now the price of chain GPT hasn't actually done much in the last month and so I do not expect this video to get a lot of views I make this video anyways simply so that I can point towards that in 2 3 4 5 months from now chain GPT has been rallying and crashing and now is back to consolidation now this doesn't look like an alltime high but actually we are at an all-time high not in the price but in the market cap what does that mean it means that now there's way more Capital Bound in chain GPT and the price simply didn't hit alltime highs because there's now more tokens floating around the number of circulating chain GPT tokens has increased so far 38% of the total Supply is Circ calculating and this is how the increase looks over time now who is getting all of those tokens is this a fair launch is this all going to the stakers there is some that goes to the stakers but most of it is simply just early investors here's the staking program and you get somewhere between Z and 8% you can get 44% but this is simply liquidity staking so you are subject to impermanent loss here you're not getting money just for staking you're getting money because of the trading fees that occur against this chy versus BD liquidity pool if you couldn't follow what I just said then maybe you have to look a bit deeper into defi it's a very standard decentralized Finance mechanism that's independent of chain GPT now here's something I like even though the distribution isn't pretty for the general public and even though the price can crash as we've seen in the past the project is very transparent about the distribution we can see that 9% of tokens go to marketing another 9% to the Dow 9% to the team for 4% to the development it's interesting that the development is not part of the team there's only 9% to the public and almost 16% in private funding rounds key opinion leaders so influencers get almost as much as the public so if you see a lot of crypto YouTubers Shilling this project here you know why they are getting paid handsomely I never take any money from any project the only way how I monetize my YouTube is with the premium membership link is down below I'll talk about this more later in the video now on supply. chain gp.org we've even got a life circulating Supply tracker we can see that from the total 383 million that are currently circulating 336 million are just for team Finance vesting so this is a token in the strong strong hands of the people running the show this is pretty much the exact opposite toomics of something like kaspa that was completely fairly launched where everybody got their share through mining chain gbt works very differently chain gbt puts a lot of money on marketing hoping to increase the investor size fast enough that the dilution doesn't take over so you might have already noticed that I'm not the guy that simply just runs you through the website and sells you the marketing Jazz I try to look at the data that most people aren't looking at I try to be as objective as possible and so let's have a look at one of those data points that most people don't look at let's have a look at the GitHub repository so this is the place where program submit their code changes so we can see how much is the project just in terms of raw programmer activity developing and this is not too great a last update on the documentation on January 4th another update in December of last year I've seen more active repositories to be completely honest I've also toyed around a little bit with their tools on the website they don't all work at least for me when I tried this on Google Chrome so for example here we click on change gbt the chatbot which is for free we get this is here on the right I click on General assistant but I can't enter any message here this seems to be dead there's two versions of the token one of them being on ethereum that token has 2,400 holders and the main token on the binance smart chain with 34,000 holders let's have a look at data that other YouTubers cannot look at because they don't have access to this tool I've developed this tool I like to segregate what is retail doing versus what are the whales doing who's buying who's selling who's imp impacting the price and for change GT we have to do this for both tokens right for ethereum and for the binance smart chain here's the token on ethereum and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 chain GPT tokens so at the current price that's roughly $193 that's small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail it's a 10x from the left chart so this is now roughly $2,000 minimum holding on the right side we've got roughly $20,000 worth of holding so longterm all wallet cohort tend to be accumulating this chart starts in June of 2023 here's the same for the last month only mainly accumulation on all fronts let's have a look at the main token the binance smart chain also very nice long-term accumulation by all wallet cohorts in the last 30 days that accumulation isn't that clear anymore especially the number of largest whales went down somewhat and so who was driving the plus 11% in the last month it was not the Wales it was the regular retail dude that's buying in and they bought in luckily fast enough that the massive token dilution so far couldn't take over but we have to keep growing at this rate now why am I even looking at this token the reason why I look at this is because I found a very successful influencer buying in this heavily so it's not an influencer that got the token just sent to their wallet for promoting it it's an influencer that actually made a swap and so let's have a look at premium we are tracking various influencers and among them crypto gains crypto gains bought $57,000 worth of chain GPT just yesterday that was at 19 so he might be in slight profit now so let's have a look I would not be surprised to see crypto Gaines make a video on chain GPT soon it maybe he can even move the price a little because currently the market cap is only 74 million it's not that much if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I probably regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and of course do not forget to join premium we are tracking influencers super super closely we buy before the general Masters know about this and we also have access to tools that most people don't have access to this tool together with a tutorial video is in premium as well feel free to check it out it's the

This video is for entertainment purposes only. Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #moonriver  #movr #crypto",this week Moon River had a phenomenal run more than 150% in this week we're going to look at whether or not this run is sustainable and what's driving all of this this is the rally I'm talking about more than 250% even in the last month now Moon River is the Smart contract platform on kusama and kusama is the playground for poad do and so we're looking here at several layers of risks stacked on top of each other first there's poad do then there's kusama then there is Moon River and so it doesn't surprise that if po dot goes up kusama goes up more and Moon River goes up even more than that this is what we see in the price charts as well this here is poka dot relative to ethereum so we're not looking at the US dollar chart we're looking at the chart relative to e and that matters because we want outperformance right we are getting into something more risky than ethereum in order to gain more performance right if you only get ethereum's performance why not simply just buy e you buy something like polka dot something more risky something that doesn't have as much adoption because you want to get more performance and so when Bitcoin goes up when ethereum goes up then of course all the altcoins go up as well and vice versa the question is always is there outperformance by taking on more risk now most of the time that was not true for Poka do but since the beginning of October that has changed and that's actually not a surprise if you're following this channel for a while you know that something happened at the beginning of October in the stablecoin market if you're very new here and you don't know what I'm talking about feel free to check out other videos on this channel now this is poad do relative to ethereum this is kusama relative to ethereum now poka do did underperform Eve in the bare Market 90% but kusama is pretty much like a levered version on this minus 96.5% now Moon River takes this to the extreme the bare Market destroyed the capital by 97.6% so the movements happen in both directions when we're in a bare Market the movements get Amplified to the downside but the same is true now that we are in a bull market Moon River tends to go up more than kusama which tends to go up more than ethereum here this is Moon River red relative to kusama and it outperformed by more than 100% 115 this is kusama relative to pokadot also outperformed recently by 50% but besides that inherent leverage that obviously lets Moon River now push harder what's the explanation for this massive massive underperformance is this really just risk aversion by the market during bearish times I'm not so sure look at the circulating supply of Moon River over time this went up by more than 45% in the last year alone a very constant very massive increase in a bit more than 2 years the circulating Supply went from 1.9 million all the way to 8.7 million and if the demand doesn't grow as quickly of course the performance has to suffer especially relative to ethereum because even though Moon River might go up when the rest of the market goes up relative to ethereum it cannot outperform when the supply increases that quickly here is Moon River's total value locked over time this is in US Dollars it was once at almost 400 million ion now it's at 11 million but even measured in Moon River tokens not in US Dollars this also went down significantly from 9 million Moon River tokens to half a million only the inflation of the dot token itself of poka dot isn't that bad though Moon River's inflation is very bad poot inflation isn't that bad they're currently at 1.4 billion tokens and one year from now this will be at 1.55 billion roughly so what does this tell us it tells us that it's very very dangerous to hold something like Moon River outside of a bull market that being said we are currently in the bull market the altcoins tend to outperform everything else people are deploying their dollars for crypto again the stable coin market cap is expanding more and more tether is being printed and that's a reflection of people simply depositing their hard-earned cash into centralized exchanges for example that then move this forward to tether that then prints the tokens creates the tokens my approach to Ries like this is to take at least a mental trailing stop loss so you look at how is the price rising and you try to take profit at as long as we keep on Rising and the price drops by say 20 or 30% more than the historical volatility then you want to be exiting very fast because long-term obviously that token Supply will again depress the price at some point for now though the music is playing and so this R can continue for quite a while as long as there is hype around pokka do if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe there's also a free telegram link is down

is going on with polygon metic the token went up by more than 25% in the last week a rally we haven't seen for quite a while while Bitcoin stayed pretty much flat now here's the news everybody is talking about polygon is moving from the metic token to the P token that's cross chain and that can be staked in multiple places but there have been announcement around this migration for quite a while we've got one over here on July 18th another one on September 14th and the announcement that the P token went live on ethereum that was on the 25th of October last year and so imagine you would have bought during those announcements what we've got over here is the Matic price relative to ethereum so we try to isolate the idiosyncratic movements of Matic and we try to remove the general ups and downs so this announcement over here 25th of October corresponds with the first line the other two announcements are over here had you bought with the first announcement you'd now be down relative to ethereum by almost 70% and the rally that we're currently seeing is simply just a bit of a retracement in the grand scheme of things now let's have a look at a few onchain metrics what we've got over here is the number of unique depositors per day to the polygon ZK evm chain a lot of excitement initially but now waning down quite a bit with now less than 100 users per day depositing here we've got the to total value locked development over time that doesn't look that bad so the depositors seem to not pull out their funds and if you measure that tvl in metic the growth seems to be somewhat stable since beginning of the year so that pretty much doubled in the span of 8 to 9 months let's dive a bit deeper let's have a look at the P token and its adoption what we've got on the left is the number of wallets that have at least 2,000 P tokens so at the current price of around 50 c that equates to $11,000 in the middle we go a 10x from that that's $10,000 on the right we go another 10x that's $100,000 here we've got the exact same charts but for the original meic token also on the ethereum Chain initially a lot of growth but since beginning of the year people tend to sell across the board for small retail as well as the large Wales now here's what I find very interesting in our tool which is by the way available to Premium we can have a look at the first wallets that received and that traded the token so those wallets are very likely either insiders or at least very well-informed very quick movers let's have a look at the first wallet that has been active by almost 3 years it's going up today alone by almost 9% $62,000 and it holds a lot of Evo tokens now I've never looked at Evo but when an Insider of the new metic token is involved in a token that I've never heard of it probably makes sense to do some research here's another wallet it currently has $10,000 in it not a lot of interesting coins but maybe still makes sense to monitor the transactions when is this wallet buying and selling wallet number three this time $200,000 worth most of that value is on the Kronos chain where this apparent metic Insider is shorting the C token relative to bitcoin so a borrowing of crow tokens while holding rep Bitcoin a position I've never opened but it seems to be doing relatively well since beginning of the year C underperformed Bitcoin by roughly 36% so that's then pure profit here's apparently the wallet by the CEO of dbank also one of the very first wallets that interacted with the new P token and he's holding pretty much a bunch of everything but a major position is in The Vow token which I don't know either might make sense to have a look at this too and so this is in general a pretty good approach let's have a look at two more over here is one with almost a million that has got 100,000 of rch and here we've got crypto Corin that doesn't have anything not worthy at the moment but I do like this approach in general there's a saying right that we are the average of the five people that we interact with most probably something similar can be said for crypto right when we've got people that are very early to the party and we've got wallets that tend to make money over time if we simply just observe those people very closely we might also have a higher likelihood of actually winning because in the end crypto is a game both of luck but also of skill right and over time the luck component balances out so the skill component prevails and if our crypto input doesn't just come from random schillers on YouTube but actually comes from people that tended to make good calls in the past and that are very early to new launches then maybe we are potentially onto something that can generate gains now let me do a Shameless pluck over here in premium we are actually following quite a few different wallets so I'm not going to show the entire addresses but over here we've got quite a lot of wallets and very often we get those wallets through screenshots on their videos or through advanced onchain analysis we also discussing those influencer wallets and try to find new ones in the telegram chats and we're also tracking them as in we have a telegram chat where we get an alert at the exact point in time when a swap happens for example here the martini guy has a Solana wallet where he just bought the Grimace token and there's also comments over here I don't want to share more because again that's part of premium and so does it make sense to buy the metic token now I think what's important is to not over interpret the news because we've seen in the past those news events did not necessarily correlate with positive price section we've also seen this in the past with the ethereum token right when ethereum move from proof of work to proof proof of stake that merge also rather correlated with negative price action what I think is more important is to find the alpha it's to find the information that most people don't have it's to be closer to the people that tend to make money over time if it's your first time here Fe you to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much

impressive the largest decentralized exchange on Solana radium its token almost doubled in the last month while Solana went pretty much sideways it only increased by 10 20% now let's have a look at what's driving all of this why is radium outperforming and it's try to figure out how much longer this really can potentially last now we are currently at $289 we are up 84% this month and Solana's price development looks very different at first this outperformance is surprising because there is some kind of tight coupling between the two radium is a huge part of Solana the trading volume on the entire Solana chain was 3.9 billion in the last 24 hours the trading volume on radium alone was 2.9 billion radium is riding a bullish wave on top of another bullish wave decentralized Finance is recovering quite a bit from that defi winter so across all of defi we've got now $87 billion worth of total value lock we crashed from 180 billion all the way down to 37 and now we are recovering again this is across all chains Solana's recovery looks stronger we are almost at all-time highs here and we are accelerating in the recovery now within Solana radium has seen most gains in the last month we've seen 94% of total value locked increase none of the other larger protocols came even close and so radium is very very close to making actual all-time highs that EX seed the defi summer in 2021 so it seems like there's something fundamental going on behind this price rally it's not just the price pumping it seems like the usage is increasing let's dive a bit deeper into those usage statistics on the left we've got the decentralized exchange trading volume across various protocols on Solana and of course radium is the largest here in purple and of course it's also fluctuating quite a bit now on the right we see the liquidity or the capital that's locked up across those different decentralized exchanges that fluctuates a bit less and again we can see growth and so radium's market share within the Solana decentralized exchange ecosystem is increasing on the left again we've got the trading volume that's now currently at a market share of 62% on the right we've got the liquidity that's at the market share of 68% now where does all of this trading activity come from it comes from pump. fun so that's a Launchpad for various mem coins just have a look at the chart on the left the number of newly listed tokens is massively going up it just hit an all-time high one week ago and it outnumbers the tokens listed first time on radium by more than 40x so first the tokens get listed on pump. fun if they are successful if they get traction then they move over to radium to get more liquidity and so because of the success of pump. fund the number of newly listed tokens isn't just high for Solana it's high for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole so that's what we are seeing on the left we see the number number of newly created tokens and Solana is outpacing everything else again because of pump. fun now the big question is is this all organic or is this all Bots creating random tokens that in the end aren't getting used let's have a look at the number of transactions on chain let's also have a look at the number of Traders on chain let's start with the transactions guess what line is Solana Solana is dominating every other chain Again by a multiple X base has one .2 million transactions per day Solana has almost 20 here's the number of unique Traders over time base is currently at 350,000 Solana is at 3 million now we all know where this activity is coming from we all know the use case of Solana we know why the trading volume is so active it is pretty much a casino it is mem coin trading have a look at the top trending tokens in the last 24 hours ordered by liquidity number one is a meme coin number two is is a mem coin number three is a meme coin they are all mem coins it's nothing but mem coin trading in the past we also had some defi in the past we also had some crypto gaming now it's all just memes and this is to a degree Justified because all gains are made in the memes check out the categories page on coin gecko the performance in the last week all of this is memes AI memes regular memes pum fum memes yes we've got liquid Stak to and deepin but among the top of the top per performers it's all meme coins and so that's the problem right meme coins are hyper risky and the returns are somewhat concentrated yes the sector as a whole grew by 30% in the last week but some make multiple X returns While others go to zero meme coin trading is the definition of a player versus player game there's only winners and losers there's no net sum positive so it's all about being more skilled than others to make money with meme coins we need to be better informed than most we need to have better data than most it's not that easy to be among the few winners and so we have to ask ourselves right what's the edge that we have in the market where do we know something that most others don't now I've built the premium membership that's a paid platform where we do various things trying to get an edge in the market for example we track various influencer wallets we know when Crypt banter is buying and selling things we know when Jesse echel is buying and selling things he has Jesse echel with 223,000 subscribers he sometimes buys coins to then afterwards promote OTE them on the channel and of course a promotion creates visibility visibility creates new purchases and it's always good to be among the early buyers right to buy when the influencer is buying and not when the YouTube video is launched now this works better the larger the channel is Right we've also got Crypt with 1.1 million subscribers for Crypt Venta alone we've got 33 wallets that we are tracking in total we've got more than 400 wallets and so that's how we try to beat the market right we look at those different signals we look at when are influential people buying and selling selling when a good Traders buying and selling and then we discuss those different signals in dedicated altcoin chats in telegram for example we got a nice signal for the book of ethereum token which then afterwards went parabolic and besides all of the signals and all of the discussion there's also a lot of tutorial videos for example an entire course on how to find those different wallets and how to track them but in total there's not more than 100 videos in premium the link is down below it's the biton trade.com it's currently 125 per month but there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium simply message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so to sum it all up I believe that the mem coin trading frenzy is likely going to continue and I believe that radium is well positioned for that I also believe that the price appreciation somewhat reflects the increased usage Solana seems to be winning the race and within Solana it seems to be the meme coin trading that's taking over the simple bet is to buy ra y but the real upside is in buying mem coin that have only a few million of market cap and that aren't in the billions if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in

Price Prediction, Mini longterm, Mini Tokenomics,  #mini #memecoin #crypto","the mini meme coin on Solana is going up like a hockey stick the question is is this manipulation or is this proper Demand by retail let's have a look at how much longer this rally can last using onchain analytics so here we are we are currently at 7 cents the price went up by 15% today alone and it's the sixth largest trending token on Solana when ordered by liquidity there's $2.8 million in that liquidity pool now it seems always a bit dangerous looking for token directly on Dex screener right there's a lot of Honey pots there's a lot of scams let's have a look at the security rating so over here we've got the Dex tool page of mini and it's got a 99 out of 99 security audit pass so no worries on that front now I'm not going to walk you through the website and bore you with the marketing Jazz this is not how we can get an edge in crypto we want to know the data most people aren't looking at so let's start off with the simple things for example we've got around 10,000 holders on Solana and that compares to what 500 members in telegram that's odd but there we go there's also a second telegram Channel and that's got 3,000 so now it makes more sense now here's the chart why mini is an exciting token I rarely see charts like this this is the number of firsttime Traders per day in the token and that comes directly from the Solana chain normally we only have 100 to 200 new users but this shot up rapidly starting on the 5th of October and is now at around 1,500 new wallets every day now what's even better is that yesterday we have seen more firsttime Traders then recurring Traders we don't see that often so that means that the investor base is growing it's growing very very quickly and the more investors there are in the token the higher the price of course can go the trading volume is pretty equally split and doesn't favor any size so small retail is all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token medium ret retail goes all the way to 10,000 large retail all the way to 100,000 and Wales is then everything above 100,000 it looks like the trading volume is not necessarily dominated by the Wales and it also doesn't look like retail is losing ground again because a lot of new wallets enter now what does fluctuate though is the interest in the token and that causes quite some price fluctuations as well this is the trading volume over time measured in US Dollars and again this is split by the different wallet cohorts attention really comes in waves and currently we are rather high on that attention and unfortunately that's not good because there is a positive correlation between trading volume and price when trading volume is very low the price is low when trading volume is very high the price is high as well now here's the number of small holders over time now how is a small holder defined it's a wallet that has at least 10,000 mini tokens at the current price that's a bit over $700 again this comes in waves and have a look here at the bottom 13 14 15 of July we will come back to that in a second but here's something that I want to point out had your bought around that point when the momentum turned around you would now be up by more than 2600% so the number of retail wallets only Grows by a bit over 50 maybe around 60% and the price can go up that massively now let's check the larger wallet so that's now a 10x in minimum holding that's minimum roughly $7,000 worth of the token at current prices and we can see how the growth isn't as steady here's another 10x so that's now $70,000 worth of the token and here this goes pretty flat so the whales aren't really buying they aren't really selling or let's say at least the number of whales isn't really changing and so again here are all the charts side by side something happened around the 13 to 15 of July and I will show you what happened here in premium we've got various features one of them is our altcoin chats and we talk about how various people buy and sell and of course we're using onchain analytics for that now check this out paulo. bought some mini tokens at a price of 0.7 now we are not at 0.7 but we are at 7 cents so at 10x since then who is Paulo dool it's a very successful Trader that made 9 a half million with dog with head and another 7 million with Bowden and of course also another 6 million with Bon and so we are following Paulo dool we've got six of his wallets that give us signals like this right this is an automatically generated message from a wallet tracker and besides those six wallets we also have 419 other wallets of various influencers and various other successful Traders and so this is how I think we can get an edge in the market it's buying when trading volume is low and it's buying when the successful people the smart money is buying as well and so there's a link to premium down below it's the bitcoin.com there's also a link to the free telegram so the free telegram doesn't have all the features but still if your portfolio doesn't justify premium then that's the place to join looking very much forward to chatting

Turbo Review, Turbo Price, Turbo Price Prediction, Turbo longterm, Turbo Tokenomics,   #turbo #memecoin #crypto","the turbo token is rallying again it more than doubled in the last month and the big question is how much longer can this rally last let's have a look at some on data most people aren't considering let's try to find out whether or not it makes sense to still buy turbo so this is where we are we are currently at 0.7 the price went up by 109% in the last month a lot of those gains just happened in the last few days the market cap is slightly above 500 million which means a doubling would bring it close to to pop cat if the price was to triple it would get close to Bonk with a 10x it would be among the top three meme coins and flip paye now tobo can be traded on the ethereum Chain we currently have roughly 40,000 holders I think it's important to look at those holders in more detail when are new Traders coming in when are Traders getting out a growing investor base is usually what increases mem coin prices sustainably and so let's have a look at just that what we've got over here is the number of new users versus returning users on any given day for tobo in the last 30 days we see that a lot of new users entered on the 16th of September you can also see that as a fraction of all of trading the 16th of September had been a day with a lot of new accumulation with a growing investor base and so here is why I like onchain analytics so much again the idea is the more people come into a token the longer the price can potentially rally and stay elevated the two vertical lines over here indicate the beginning end of the 16th of September so this is where we got this influx of new people and subsequently the price ried by another 50% now what's interesting is that we see again the price rallying right the price dropped first is now rising to a similar degree but at the same time we do not necessarily see that many new users coming in what's exactly going on here let's have a look at retail investors versus whale investors again those are charts showing the last 30 days on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 130,000 turbo tokens so at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $110,000 worth of the token on the right we go to $100,000 worth of the token now have a look at this big jump there was a lot of new people coming in exactly on the 16th of September the point in time we've already noticed before but what we then see is that the number of those retail investors did not necessarily grow medium-sized retail also did not grow but the Wales they grew yes they also bought a little bit on the 16th of September but then sold again but have a look at this since the 1st of October the number of whales is going up it went up by roughly 10 wallets and again those wallets here are 100 times larger than those wallets over here so 10 Wallets on on the right is equal to 1,000 Wallets on the left and so the accumulation by the Wales started over here they bought the dip they accumulated more and more and they are taking advantage of the current rally let's zoom out a little bit because all of the prior charts were simply just the last month what we've got over here though is a logarithmic chart of the entire history of tobo which starts in May of 2023 here's again the holding by those different wallet cohorts same kinds of thresholds but this time not just the last month but everything since tobo started trading and we see how the selling stopped in the middle of January of this year interestingly enough though the price turned around already a bit earlier in other words retail stopped selling here and this is when the price was able to subsequently rise quite nicely but it seems like the Wales again had been a bit earlier they bought the bottom potentially already in October of 2023 so here we go we see in October of 2023 the number of whale wallets went up slightly it then went down again but this was already the time when retail took over and stopped selling so it's always a move between retail and whales and very often the whales are the early movers it's very important to follow whatever they are doing when they are dumping it might make sense to be cautious let's have a look at the very largest wallets let's see if they are buying or selling let's look at the centralized exchange balances before we do this feel free to subscribe because I publish videos on turbo and on various other mem coins regularly on this channel now here's the trading on centralized exchanges the token can be bought pretty much everywhere binance is dominating the trading volume but we also have activity on okx gate.io on HDX and on qoin and so it's no surprise when we look at the top token holders that we see those centralized exchanges most Supply is held by uphold okx follows we've also got binance over here and bitet Mexi and crypto.com is also part of the party let's check out the two largest wallets here's wallet number one accumulated quite consistently up until the end of May of this year here's wallet number two also accumulated was trading a little bit the range but then also around May of this year started to sell quite consistently and so check this out this is the long-term turbo price and have a look at what happened at the end of May of this year the price went down by 65% and so it appears as if there is somewhat constant selling pressure in Turbo now the rally started with retail was then taken over by some whales but at the back of all of this we do see continued selling but it's not strong enough to depress the price right now those large centralized exchanges are very careful not to destroy this rally because as long as the price goes up the retail interest is likely going to grow as well and it seems like a lot of meme coins are currently rallying turbo is not an exception now all the charts all the statistics that I've shown in this video is part of a tool that I've developed myself that's available to the premium members you can plug in any token into this tool and you can analyze quite a few different blockchains so of course there's ethereum but there's also arbitrum Avalon binance smart chain polygon optimism and even some more obscure blockchains like linear manle and nosis premium also has a video on how to use all of those onchain analytics tools there's a separate tool also for Solana and of course we also have various Al coin chats where we discuss what might be the next turbo so the link to premium is down below if your portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram

Tokenomics,  #stellar #xlm #crypto","Stella was the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 in the last week and crypto tends to move in waves it tends to move in Trends will this trend continue let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here are the top 100 and they are ordered by the performance in the last week Stella or xlm doubled it's not just the last week where xlm did well it's also the last month it's a top performer in the last month as well you could throw your money at pretty much anything and made more but since xlm did best this week and this month does it still make sense to buy at those levels let's have a look now there's clearly attention on the token and attention sometimes turns into purchases and here's a statistic not a lot of other people will share with you this is the performance of the last Stellar video on this channel an average video is here in Gray and that first Stellar video is in blue it made 3.7 times more views than an average video now the question question is always what is driving a price R right why is something going up and in the prior video we looked at adoption of the Stella blockchain we had a look at are there more transactions are there more active wallets Etc and I don't want to repeat myself so feel free in case you haven't watched it yet to check it out the title is buy the Stella rally xlm crypto token analysis now here's the chart everybody is looking at this is the xlm chart the Stellar chart in US Dollars and it is somewhat scary because you have seen very similar pump and dumps in the past the price shot up to then subsequently bleed for the next 1 to 2 years so it's a case of fool me once fool me twice are we getting fooled a third time now it appears as if this current R isn't yet over as in we've seen prices of 68 cents and 74 cents at its peak but this is just the price we haven't looked at the market cap Stella is an inflating token there's now way more xlm tokens around than in 2018 and so in terms of market cap we are very close to historical Heights now was there any kind of indication that would have pointed towards buying Stella before this rally I believe the answer is yes and it's in relative valuation charts so when we don't look at xlm in US dollars but when we look at it relative to bitcoin then we do see a quite interesting flaw have a look at this here this is the Stellar price relative to bitcoin a very long-term chart starting in 2014 and the bottom that we saw in March of 2017 relative to bitcoin is the exact same bottom that we've just recently seen so we're bouncing off exactly at the Historical low I do not think that this is coincidence a lot of people say that technical analysis is worth nothing but things like this right turn around at the exact same point in time with the relative variation to bitcoin I don't think it just happens out of nothing I do believe that there is some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy here and with s fulfilling prophecy I simply mean that if enough people look at that data at the same time and enough people agree that it's currently comparatively cheap and that it might make sense to buy at that point that enough people do buy and then the prophecy self fulfills itself now on this channel I like to look at onchain analytics I like to look at the buyers and sellers of the token who is currently driving prices now unfortunately most of trading volume happens in centralized exchanges in the black boxes we can't really transparently look at what's happening over there in the order books but there is a ported token of xlm on the binance smart chain and over here we can see what's going on so before we look at the onchain analytics one quick view at what's going on with trading volume most trading volume happens of course on binance followed by coinbase followed by xt. comom which is a WID labeled version of binance now this is the spot market we've also got the Perpetual Futures Market where it's not just binance that's involved but also by bit now for the ported version on the binance smart chain we've got a bit under 14,000 holders but not all of those 14,000 holders are created equally some might only hold a few cents of the token others might hold thousands of the token and so what we see over here is the number of retail investors medium-sized investors and whale investors and we differentiate by holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least a th000 stellar tokens so at the current price that's roughly $500 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in M hold holding so that's now $5,000 worth of the token on the right side it's the Wales at least for the B smart chain it's $50,000 worth of the token all wet cohorts long-term so since porting to the binance smart chain in July of 2021 tended to accumulate over time but the question is what happened on chain in the last month where the price almost 5x so it went up almost 400% here's the answer to that question retail investors actually did not accumulate on chain mediumsized also did not accumulate and the number of whales did go up not by much but it did slightly go up what we do see though is that the number of new wallets tends to grow with that price R so again this is the last month only and initially we only had like 10 or so new users on the bance smart chain that bought Stella now it's around 200 it is slowing down yesterday was only 100 and today is a data point we can't yet take into consideration because today hasn't yet finished but there's definitely some growth there is though more trading of returning users versus new users which makes sense because the token has been around for a very long time here's the number of buyers and sellers over time and again we see how there's a tension moves and currently we are spiking very high in attention and unfortunately we do not necessarily want to buy when attention is at its maximum right there is a correlation between attention and price when attention is high the price is high but attention tends to move from token to token when it moves away from sell this might not be that great for the token now the crypto Market Market as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly and I like to look at the stable coin market cap to determine whether or not we're currently in the bull market or in a bare market and that is the chart we see over here sometimes we see the stable coin market cap going up sometimes we see it going down and the reason why I like this chart so much is because it has very little volatility right it doesn't go tically up and down like the Bitcoin price or like the Dogecoin price it has very clear Trends what happened over here was the defi collapse of the anchor protocol right so this is when Terra Luna went bust this is when the US stable coin depack this is when a lot of people withdrew money from crypto it started a whole Bare market and during that bare Market Bitcoin went from 69k all the way down to 16k and also FTX collapsed during that bare Market since October of last year we see an expansion of the stable coin market cap again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the reason why this chart is so useful is not just because we can see clearly the trend where currently the crypto Market is at what's also nice about it is that we can deterministically say that currently money is flowing into crypto as in traditional Finance the traditional Finance world is moving Fiat into the crypto space because whenever this is going up this means that you send for example your US dollars to binance and binance then sends this to a custodian of stable coins let's say tether tether then takes custody of your money right it puts it in some kind of bank account or in some kind of bonds and then mince the tokens on the blockchain and we can see the tether minting here in this chart and so the exact opposite happens when this is going down this is when you withdraw your fiat currency from binance and so I think there's roughly 177 billion reasons to believe that the price of crypto is likely going to continue to rise from here all of crypto and so this is what I mean with all of crypto right crypto is highly correlated to one another when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well but they don't go up to the same degree here are the top 100 alt coins in the last 7 Days ordered by their performance and the best performer was Stella with a bit over 100% but have a look at this this is the best performing meme coins in the last s days and we've got chill guy with more than 3,000% in the last 7 days we talked about chill guy several times on this channel but we also talked about the goat token several times on this channel when it was still very very cheap now goat is the largest of the meme coins on the Solana blockchain that had been launched with pump. fun so pump. fun is the Launchpad of mem coins on Solana there's a lot of trading happening over there and goat has the largest market cap now I made a video on Goat when it was still at 24 cents that was on the 16th of October subsequently the price went up by more than 500% now recently it came down again a bit and so I tried to find tokens that currently have positive momentum that still have a lot of upside potential tokens that can still do the 345 X's that are probably not possible anymore with the larger tokens so if you're interested in being early in those kind of bets then feel free to subscribe to this channel right I publish videos regularly here now how did I find out about the gold token for example that early the answer is wallet tracking have a look at this influencer Kyle Chessie bought the gold token already at 14 cents so that was over here subsequently the price went up by more than 800% now what is wallet tracking the blockchain is completely transparent right we can see who's buying who's selling the only difficult part is to find out what are the wallets that are important who owns what kind of wallets what kind of wallets actually make money and so here is Kyle chesse he's got more than 130,000 subscribers he's the person that bought gold early and so through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets we always get a signal when he's buying or selling something or have a look at this alert from today bankless bought the clanker token for $53 since then the price went up by 57% again that's in a matter of a few hours and have a look at this below right this is the onchain analytics that one of our moderators performed on The Token here's the bankless channel they've got almost a quarter of a million subscribers and of course when they talk about a token this generates a lot of attention and attention then means purchases and purchases mean a rising price we only have two of Bank L's wallets but we try to find more again we use onch analytics and we have our people in the chats that use various methods to find wallets of people that move markets I want to share one more trade and it's probably the most impressive of the trades because it turns a micro cap into a pretty large pump and dump this was on November 23rd the martini guy bought the moon token on pump fun right we already talked about pump. fun and he did this at a price of 412 this is how that developed once a got traded on radium ined up by more than 1,000% now it's at 434 so even after the dump we are still up by roughly 3x that's how early those kind of signals are here is the martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers roughly and here are the wallets that we Track by this guy 12 in total we now have exactly 500 wallets in our tracking so it's not just the three influencers that I just mentioned we've got way more and so this is I believe the real way to make money in crypto right you want to know things that most people don't know how else can you buy lower than others and sell higher than others if you don't have a market Edge if you don't know more than others it's better to be very closely to the people that buy early and then potentially sell when all the masses come and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it is eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to set up the the tracking for the influencer wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about the back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell what are the current onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel fore to check it out it's currently $125 per month the price will increase next week so you can lock in still this old price and keep that old price there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you do not like premium just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to keep on holding Stella probably yes because Stella will appreciate with the rest of the market most likely that being said is it the best risk to reward play I'm not so sure because attention right now shortterm is very high and there is correlation between attention and price I think the best upside is in the small tokens in the

Cryptos I&#39;m Buying Before they Explode! #cryptocurrency #altcoins #crypto,This is a short list of altcoins I'm buying before they explode. I believe these coins have a higher chance of outperforming bitcoin before the end of the crypto bull run.,at the start of the year I began tracking 11 specific coins while many have already rallied some are still building up for their big move so far only Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high salana jasmi and render have performed well year-to dat with salana even reclaiming its 52- we highs meanwhile cardano and xrp have started pumping and seem poised to continue their upward momentum however Avalanche Gala hadera polka dot and ethereum have yet to show significant progress for this reason I plan to keep accumulating these coins in the coming days stopping only once they recover their 52e highs Avalanche polka dot and hadera are currently trading at roughly 2x below their 52- we highs while Gala lags further behind needing nearly a 3X move to reclaim its 52- we High,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxNpm_Htbs,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Cardano', 'Avalanche', 'Render', 'Gala']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WqxNpm_Htbs/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-15T16:17:18Z

Aero Tokenomics,  #aerodrome #aero #crypto","Krypto is recovering and Aerodrome on the base chain is leading that recovery now things haven't always been that great right we had a massive crash now we tend to go up again the question is what's causing the sell pressure what's causing the buy pressure who's buying who's selling let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people aren't considering we're going to look at transactions we are going to look at tokenomics let's dive deep into the details aerodome is currently at 80 cents it's up 9 % today this week we are up by 50% but have a look at this we crashed from more than 80 cents down to 40 cents to now recover let's have a look at what actually went on over here I believe at least parts of the recovery can be explained by the base chain outperforming all the other blockchains in the last week check this out this is defi Lama and it looks at the total value locked change in the last 7 days and Bas outperformed everything else we are now at 1.5 billi million dollar locked on base and Aerodrome is the largest of the decentralized exchanges on the base chain let's also have a look at relative variations to for example Unis swap right is the current price the current market cap Justified now if this is your first time researching aerod Drome then maybe you should be considering following channels like this because I published a video on aerod Drome 138 days ago that was when the price was still at 47 cents so that was over here on the four off of March but let's now have a look at what those 122,000 holders are actually doing how can we dive into this number and here is what's supporting the aerodome price it's especially the retail investors what we've got over here are three charts the left chart shows the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 Arrow tokens so that's directly on chain and that's equivalent to $ 87 right now in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $8,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's at least $80,000 worth of the token isn't it interesting how the number of holders is increasing very constantly over time retail in aggregate tends to never sell medium-sized retail sells sometimes and I've just updated the right chart the whales actually did sell a bit in the last month and since those Wallets on the right are on average 100 times more important than the Wallets on the left that kind of a drop can explain quite a bit of a price crash but again the retail demand continues to stay strong here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month small retail grew by roughly 13 14% medium-sized retail grew to the same degree but the whales they tend to sell off and because the number of whales went down and because those kind of wallets are a 100 times more important than those kinds of wallets that's why we see this massive volatility in the price now let's have a look at to economics because they are very important for Aerodrome 54% of all of Supply is in a voting escrow and another 7.4% are again in smart contracts here's the initial distribution of Aerodrome who got what kind of tokens the team got 14% protocol grants are another 10% so that's also development for aerodome and this is then how the supply grows over time according to EPO currently we are at 1.1 billion aot tokens floating so that puts us roughly here on the chart Aerodrome launched roughly one year ago and the number of tokens roughly doubled in that time in the next months the supply will grow by roughly 10% per month and so those are the two major forces right when the supply is growing by 10% per month and the number of investors Grows by 15% then error can of course go up if the whales aren't selling too much in the meantime the toomics of aerodome aren't too pretty unfortunately but the adoption is pretty high the demand unfortunately is very volatile though because again it's very much dependent on the base chain how much adoption can the base chain get and when it's outperforming any other blockchain then aerodome tends to outperform as well right Aerodrome is the main bet that's idiosyncratic to the base chain there is no base token let's compare the aerodrome valuation with the Unis swap valuation and let's look at total value locked as in what's the current market cap of Unis swap what's the current market cap of aerodome and how much capital is currently in those platforms so Unis swap has a total value locked across all chains of 5.2 billion the market cap of Unis swap is 8.4 billion so there's roughly $1.6 of market cap per deposited Dollar on chain for UNIS swap aerodome has a fully diluted market cap of 930 million the total value locked is 585 million and that's equal to $1.66 of market cap relative to total value locked so the valuations are very very close to one another it's not like there's a lot of growth that's currently priced into Aerodrome the problem however is token inflation right the number of tokens will increase much faster for aerodome relative to Unis swap so we looked at the fully diluted market cap not at the current market cap a lot of trading happens on chain on the base chain so the price is very like discovered by the market there's not really manipulation going on of course there's also trading on coinbase but directly on chain on aerodome there's 18% of trading volume and the Perpetual Futures Market doesn't have much action either there's one more very important fact to consider and I haven't finished that analysis but I encourage you to do so in case you put a lot of money into Aerodrome and that's the staking program when you're staking Arrow the promise is that you're getting more Arrow tokens back in the future and you hope of course that the arrow token stays somewhat at least stable and currently the number of Arrow that's been locked is increasing and that's good for the price right it artificially lowers the circulating Supply pushing up the price with increasing demand but that number doesn't always have to go up have a look at this this is the equivalent on the binance smart chain the pancake swap token the cake token when they launched their staking program the number of cake that got staked also increased over time up until 1 year after launch this is when people redeemed their cake and sold their cake and so that happened in the middle of April 2023 and so I have a look at this this is cake relative to BNB this is the middle of April 2023 after the unlock of all of those cake tokens the price fell by more than 50% so it's very important to check this out for Arrow right will there be a lot of arrow that gets unlocked where then people might take profit I encourage you to have a very close look on that graph and in case it turns around I will of course cover this on this channel as well if you want to know what kind of Trades I do feel free to check out the premium membership I for example shorted so I bet on falling prices of cake before the unlock I'm thinking about doing potentially the same with Aerodrome if premium is still too expensive for you because the crypto portfolio isn't yet large

Crypto Shorting Assessing the Risks,,shorting cryptocurrencies is a strategy that can be profitable but requires caution Market participants often focus on coins that have surged sharply due to speculation or hype for instance if a token Rises by 300% in a week without clear fundamental reasons it could signal an overheated Market however shorting is always risky and analyzing bubbles like meme coins or projects with weak fundamentals is crucial before taking positions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrDDZ6Uga9s,[],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDDZ6Uga9s/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-30T15:40:41Z

quite a bit as well Solana tokens in general are doing pretty well now there's a lot of momentum let's have a look at how much longer this maniki really can last let's have a look at onchain data most people are not considering so have a look at how the total value locked on different chains is developing the amount of value locked in Solana grew by 28% in the last month it was one of the best performing blockchains if you haven't yet had a look at the blast blockchain you might want to do that as well that's growing very fast as well and if you want to get a bit more adventurous there's also the Merlin chain that grew by 169% in the last month but across the larger chains Solana is definitely winning the game and so Mani is up 30% today it's currently at 1.6 cents and this week it almost doubled but here's the thing about mem coin trading you do want to be very cautious with timing because over the long term man didn't do too well so let's have a look at the data directly on chain maniki has the fifth largest liquidity pool so there's $2 million locked up in the token and that's a lot relative to the market cap so most of Trading still happens on chain that's why you can look at onchain analytics and get a picture with very little Distortion we've already talked about slur book of meme the M token dock with Hat popcat Beer we've already talked about all of those tokens on this channel feel free to check out those videos now we want to find out how much more upside there is for manik key the first thing to note is that the centralized exchanges aren't yet supporting the token that much right because there's only another 4X if you go 100% on chain once we do a 4X in the price or in the liquidity we already rival slurf and book of meme so future growth really has to come from centralized exchange demand and I believe that's actually what's driving the current rally have a look at the last 24 hours the price went up by quite a bit but the number of buyers was actually smaller than the number of sellers in other words the buyers on average were larger with that trading amount than the sellers this could be accumulation by the whales it could be accumulation by the centralized exchanges which makes a lot of sense when you've got that much trading volume going on that many people interested in the token why not support this more why not be involved more in Market making there's no issue with the security of the token either the Dex I all score is very high 99 out of 99 no problem here and yes there is already ownership by centralized exchanges but it's not yet significant gate.io holds 4.5% of the token crypto.com 3.5 bitg 1.5 Mexi 1.4 and that involvement by the centralized exchanges is even advertised on the website down here so probably there was some kind of money or some kind of token allocation flowing to those centralized exchanges to enable Trading there but it doesn't look like those centralized exchanges have a large stake in this and that's probably why we see the recent rally there is going to be more Market making Happening by centralized exchanges probably the tokens will also be more promoted within the centralized exchanges at some point now the central question is always how organic is a rally and we have seen a lot of organic growth in the past now we see a lot of growth by the bigger players by the Wales the question is is there still a lot of social excitement is there still a lot of retail people jumping on this here let's have a look at the Twitter account we've got 56,000 followers and the views of the recent Twitter posts reach around 17K here 15K here 11k here and that's why the number of holders is 85,000 so it looks like this is actually organic and not too manipulated now with the involvement of centralized exchanges trading becomes a bit harder as well I personally like to trade tokens that aren't yet dominated by the centralized exchanges and I want to show you why have a look at this chart over here this is the number of users that are trading the money key token by the hour and there seems to be some Cycles over here right this tends to go up and down we have a low around 2 a.m. UTC we've got another low over here again 34 a.m. UTC here's another low same time of the day and it makes a lot of sense that at that time of the day there isn't so many new people jumping on this right this is when most people are sleeping this is also when there's few YouTube views and what's important about meme coins is that there is a correlation between a tension on a token and the price so when there's not a lot of people trading right now the price tends to be relatively speaking depressed when there is a lot of new people jumping in then of course the price tends to go up so it does make sense to buy meme coins on average when everybody else is sleeping around 2 3 a.m. UTC time zone that kind of strategy works very well when there's not yet a lot of market makers but of course once the centralized exchanges are getting involved then there are a lot of Quant traders in there as well and they balance out those effects so I like to always play against the weak competition right you want to be early you want to trade the tokens that aren't yet dominated by the bances and mexes of this world right now maniki trading is not yet dominated by the centralized exchanges there's still a lot of trading on radium directly on chain but that will likely change rather sooner than later here's another data point by by the way all of those charts here that we see in the background come from a tool that I've developed myself you can get access to that tool down below the bitcoin.com you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and look at those statistics for any token so feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com what we see over here is the trading volume per day by Trader segment and I've split this up in four segments small retail is the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token medium-sized retail is between $1,000 and $10,000 large retail is between 10,000 and 100,000 and the whales are the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token what's very interesting here is when we look at Wales and large retail so at the largest wallets the wallets with at least $100,000 of the token this is actually declining so medium-sized retail and small retail are getting engaged a lot of trading volume is happening but again note that in the last 24 hours there was less buyers than sellers while the price went up so even though retail might be trading a lot it's actually the larger wallets that are buying I will continue to make updates on maniki and on other meme coins on Solana if you're interested

strange the polygon price is going down it makes low after low while onchain everything seems to be fine the total value locked of the polygon ZK evm is relatively stable so we've got almost $100 million worth of total value locked and on the native polygon chain we've got $100 million worth of trading volume now here is one problem on that ZK evm polygon chain we see barely any activity only two 2 million worth of trading volume so 100 million total value locked but only 2 million of trading volume and that compares to other layer 2 block chains like arbitrum with more than $400 million of trading volume so 400 for arbitrum 900 for the base chain and 1.5 billion for Solana one can pretty much say that polygon ZK evm was a flop barely any usage so now we understand the price performance a bit more have a look at the number of unique depositors it's a for shell of itself we now have days where we've got less than eight bridging transactions now before we continue bashing on polygon I want to talk about one interesting statistic that can be used outside of polygon as well in case you're not yet aware in case you want to save gas fees for example because you're using ethereum and you don't have that much Capital relative to what needs to be paid for the transaction here's the best time to make those transfers there's the least activity on Saturday and Sunday and within the day it tends to be 5 a.m. GMT when gas prices are the lowest but let's get back into bashing polygon have a look at how much the number of average transactions is increasing and how much the average gas price is increasing the gas price is pretty much doubling while the number of transactions is only going up by maybe 10 20% or so what does this tell us this video is sponsored by the premium membership I never take any money from any c project I never take any affiliate links from centralized exchanges I never pump and dump coins instead I offer valuable tutorials in the premium membership feel free to check it out it tells us that polygon has a problem with throughput polygon bottlenecks the more transactions come in something very similar to what we've seen for example with Phantom check out the historical Phantom chart usually we had very very low transaction fees but then once the Phantom chain was used this Spike up to a thousand times of what it was during regular times before the problem isn't as bad for polygon but it still exists a little bit of an increase in the number of transactions increases the gas price quite a lot now how does Polygon compare to other layer tws well it seems like activity in general is going down quite a lot this is the number of users that bridge across various chains and of course this spiked around April of this year when also a lot of alt coins spiked and when we isolate the base chain we can see how there was a lot of activity during April we don't see that Spike though for polygon so there was a ton of trading on Bas and on Solana everybody was trading the meme coins polygon stayed quiet now I have talked about the toomics of polygon I have talked about the merge to POS I make several videos on metic regularly on this channel if you don't want to miss the next ones feel free to subscribe now let's talk about relative performance relative valuations Etc before we do this I publish videos on polygon regular on this channel so I talked already about the move to POS I talked about toomics Etc so if you don't want to miss the next videos on polygon feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly so there was one video titled the polygon metic death published one month ago still getting some views there was another one called the polygon metic collapse published 3 weeks ago and yes those videos didn't age too badly the price continues to go down now this is meic in US Dollars and it seems like we are not at alltime lows yet it seems like we can drop another 20% maybe it also appears as if sometimes we have these nice Ries right 150 157% even but what's triggering relies like this it's not polygon specific it was simply the overall Market going up because have a look at this we are now looking at polygon metic relative to ethereum and here the relies are much much more modest from bottom to top less than 50% and the decline since February of 2023 is r rather constant a fall of more than 80% and here's the thing ethereum itself is already doing very poorly let's have a look at the medic chart relative to bitcoin the safest of the cryptocurrencies the place to Simply Park the crypto funds here we've seen meic underperform by more than 90% and again the rallies in between do not look massive whatsoever that's very different to the US dollar chart so really it's a game of opportunity cost but how much lower can meic go now do we potentially see the ultimate floor here because in the end the game is to buy low and sell high and obviously we aren't very high now let's compare market caps so we've got 2.8 billion in the P token and we've got 1 billion in the meic token so in total a bit under 4 billion now what else is in the 4 to 5 billion range check this out we've got so for example so has an onchain trading volume of 120 million So 20% more than metic so just looking at current trading volume relative to market cap it seems to make somewhat sense the relationships are similar but here's the thing the total value locked of soy is increasing quite nicely it's not looking like polygon's total value locked a market cap of 4 billion is still pretty high especially when the toomics aren't that great and there's constant cell pressure there's still a lot of value to extract and so it appears as if polygon is becoming victim to this competition there are more and more blockchains launching every day with we've got already 317 blockchains just listed on defi Lama I personally stay away from polygon I don't really like what's going on with the momentum I don't like that there was no usage increase during April of this year and I also don't like that the market cap is still around for billion if it's your first time feel free to subscribe I publish videos regular

chance that December May outperform November for BTC and crypto prices at least that's according to the numbers here and the charts are objective the charts do not lie the Bull Run really is only just getting started and so in all likelihood we are going to have a strong December possibly one that outperforms November which of course is a good omen for altcoins so far right now and according to the metrics we're still seeing some pretty high BTC dominance but that being said there are some great altcoin projects that are starting to Make Some Noise some of them have started to go on runs already others it looks like have their runs lined up for the month of December and Beyond and that is exactly what we're considering in this video for spectacular altcoins whose fundamentals are very strong but who are just kind of starting to wake up now out of hibernation they're poed to have a terrific December and start to 2025 [Music] welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz all the very best of luck if you choose to invest whether that's into these projects that we're talking about today or any number of other altcoins that we discuss on this channel I wish you well but I'm not a financial or investment adviser just remember that as well as the fact that by extension this video is not official Financial or investment advice all right my first pick for today's altcoins that we're considering and perhaps surprisingly is Dogecoin ticker Doge do o g Dogecoin of course is a meme coin and uh it's certainly mem coin season right now nobody can deny that whatever way you look at it Dogecoin though is the king of the mem coins whatever you think of that space uh Dogecoin really is the Emperor of this Kingdom and Doge has a pretty long history it started all the way back in 2013 as a joke however it wasn't really until early April 2021 that it went parabolic it was dormant for a long time and then in late January 2021 one Doge was almost worth a cent a month later it was at 8 cents and then after that it went on the 4th of April from 5 Cent to 73 cents in a month that was on the 8th of May 2021 uh and right now we're sitting at just below 40s so it's on the way to a new all-time high with a little bit more of a push and if you think about it it was pretty hard to imagine back in 2013 that this joke of a project would have had this kind of success however in all fairness there's no Doge without Elon Musk uh and once he got involved as a personality really that's when Doge skyrocketed whenever he posts about Doge on X the price moves upwards correspondingly and then of course there's more to come with the new and upcoming Trump Administration Elon Musk will have a position there he's going to be leading as you probably know the department of government deficiency or Doge this surely is a reality that is stranger that fiction and the fact of the matter is it's not going to be all that surprising for Dogecoin to go even higher than its current 30 C mark it wouldn't surprise me at all to see new all-time highs later in the season and so with this in mind and with all that free attention that Dogecoin is receiving it wouldn't really surprise me at all to see Doge go higher than 40 cents and make its way up to and Beyond a new all-time high next up here and at number two it's been a while since we've talked about this one we're looking at Stacks ticker STX and as you may already know they are the leading Bitcoin layer 2 but one thing that you may not know uh is that it is one of the best wrapped Bitcoin products with its sbtc wrapped Bitcoin of course is a Hot Topic right now that's thanks to Justin's Sun's takeover of wbtc and the emergence of coinbase CB BTC sbtc is one to1 collateral like other rra tokens however the lack of a custodian is a huge and positive difference here between s sptc and other Solutions with sptc we don't have to wonder what Justin sun will do or if the custodian has all the collateral they claim they do with stacks and sbtc it's all transparent and right there for you to see plus it's all secured by bitcoin's hash rate not by some company's promises and anyone who runs a stack node can be a signer this ensures that sbtc stays decentralized and free of corruption this makes it the Market's most decentralized and disrupted wrapped BTC token and the lack of custodians makes sbtc the most censorship resistant wrapped Bitcoin available that's because sbtc actions take place on the Bitcoin blockchain sbtc is going multi-chain as well soon Zeus will offer sbtc on salana for of users who want programmable Bitcoin for defi also coming soon for sbtc is the full integration with coin flip this means that you're going to be able to withdraw sbtc from their ATMs all around the world when you need liquid cash or you can use the ATMs to buy your sbtc this is going to bring both sbtc and BTC availability to more people in more places sbtc is on the stacks test net now but main net is coming soon and here's that first deposit went with 15 Stacks signers notice at the bottom right you see a Bitcoin block transaction hash this transaction finalizes on the Bitcoin blockchain that's instead of in The Ledger of a custodian like Justin Suns bit Global none of the other popular rap tokens can offer that you can go give it a try or if you know you're ready to buy then go to curve that's where you can swap the sbtc wbtc pair today [Music] at number three here we are looking at cardano ticker Ada and this has been a hot one uh only a month ago we called out cardano and polad Dot as being dinosaurs uh which they are but look at what's happened since then Ada has had a 180% run over the last 30 days not in my wildest dreams uh could I have expected that but we've just been hit with the perfect storm of news for a legacy project like cardano and so here we are today Ada and a couple of other coins from the last Bull Run or other dinosaurs are making massive comebacks xrp dot sand super and a lot of others as well that are doing very very well and Ada even made it back into the top 10 as measured by crypto market cap its current price as I record sits at 97 cents with a 34 nearly $5 billion market cap and out of the 4 billion Ada we have 35 billion or about 80% in circulation and there is a major reason as to why Ada's current price is what it is why it's had the run that it's had on the 10th of November Charles hoskinson announced that he may get an advisory role to president Trump and just in case you don't know him hoskinson of course is the founder and CEO of cardano some are even speculating that hoskinson could find himself in the role of Secretary of the US Treasury I think that one a little bit far-fetched but uh it's been thrown out there as a suggestion at least I think what's much more likely and much more realistic but still fantastic uh would be a position on the newly formed crypto policy team and that would still be great that is already spectacular news my next altcoin pick here is radium last but not least here Ray is the ticker r a y it's a DEX on salana and in all fairness I don't mention radium all that often but uh it probably deserves to be looked at here it's had a very good run over these last 30 days with an uptick of about 64% however if we zoom out further over the course of a year Ray R ay is up 1327 per. but that being said if we zoom out further still uh if you can believe it it's still about 68% away from its all-time high that was in September of 2021 $16.83 whereas the current price of Ray right now is $537 Saul so is also on the rise and so is its ecosystem radium of course is a perfect example of this the predictions for Saul uh go all the way up to $1,000 which is about a 4X from here if that were to be the case I can also see a 4X or better for radium that would also mean a new alltime high radium is a solid amm automated Market maker that allows for fast and lowcost swaps it also provides various liquidity protocols it has a tvl of 2.3 billion do and with that figure it actually ranks in the third spot of all salana D Platforms in fact only goo and Jupiter have a higher tvl on salana you can also stake your ray r a y on radium and use its Bridge all to say that there's a lot to look forward to with this project uh if we extrapolate and look forward to the rest of this bull run okay set four projects here but we have a bonus at number five here in the form of polygon whose ticker is no ER madic it's now Paul p o and in 2022 and part of 2023 I really couldn't get polygon off the screen it established all kinds of new Partnerships it was especially known for that it also rolled out ZK evm and so it was doing great things in terms of these Partnerships uh they weren't just with anybody either they were topnotch uh featured major big Brands big corporations so the likes of mercedesbenz Twitter Starbucks meta Adidas Disney uh and a lot of others too was pretty intense and polygon ZK evm is a layer two scaling solution it uses zero knowledge or ZK proofs and offers low transaction costs however polygon despite all that good news faded a little bit uh however it seems to be working on a comeback right now the maic token ma atic peaked at almost $3 in December of 2021 however it then dropped to 32 cents in late October of this year since that time however it's up about 60% but in October of 2023 we saw the introduction of their new Paul P token you can use this token among all the polygon chains and Paul also saw a 60% increase over the last 30 days its current price is as I record 55 cents with a$ 4.47 billion market cap however in contrast to madic unfortunately Paul has an infinite token Supply this is not a good thing it's never a good tokenomics feature uh as far as projects go but if we can look beyond that there are certainly other positives and by that I mean that polygon is on the rise again so for example game seven Dow crowned polygon number one in gaming with the most titles across ecosystems we saw Solana make the comeback of a lifetime uh in the last couple of years now it's really teetering on new all-time highs polygon seems to be gearing up and some would say it has the same potential to do so let me know whether or not you agree with that Outlook in the comments comments

it possible that the metic token is crashing like this was metic nothing but a huge pump and dump let's have a look at the causes let's have a look at whether or not this can turn around and if it makes sense to potentially Buy Low and then maybe later sell high right that's the whole idea of crypto so this is the long-term meic chart in US Dollars and we gained nothing since March of 2021 and this looks even worse when we look at meic relative to ethereum we have seen an underperformance of 30% and we all know how ethereum has done relative to bitcoin since the move from proof of work to proof of stake it's falling and falling and somatic has even done worse than that how on Earth is it possible that polygon the fourth largest chain in terms of deployed applications it's 573 protocols counted on defi Lama how can it be that the total value locked on chain moved from 10 billion all the way down to less than 1 billion a drop of more than 90% one possible explanation is the update of the toomics with the move to P so we now do not have any maximum Supply anymore and with the meic toomics it looked like all tokens were unlocked and we are simply now at 10 billion forever but since the move to P that has changed suddenly metic or P became an inflationary token again and if the and can't grow as quickly as Supply that's of course not great another potential explanation is that the whales are simply dumping but on chain we don't really see that happening this is the genie coefficient so that's a measure of how concentrated the holding of the metic or of the P token is that did not necessarily go down the whales did not necessarily dump on retail and so another possible explanation could simply be usage right maybe polygon doesn't get used that much anymore is that the case here's the problem with crypto YouTube people promoting becoming dgen or buying 100 x coins that's what gives clicks but that's not what's going to bring you forward I refuse to take money from centralized exchanges I refuse to take money from crypto projects I refuse to pump and dump a coin and filling up my pockets in the background I don't do any of this instead I share my knowledge in the form of tutorials in the premium membership so that's content that won't do well on YouTube but that builds up skill over time you can also directly contact me over there you can directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com is the link so the problem is that the data on that subject is conflicting we've got one set of data by glass node so an onchain analytics company we've got another set of data provided by polygon directly on the Explorer so this is the data on the Explorer this seems to be growing most of the time recently we've seen a drop but overall the number of active polygon addresses tends to be growing and here we've got the same data provided by glass node the number of active addresses that peaked massively in the third and fourth quarter of 2021 this is also where the total value locked according to defi Lama peaked and subsequently it rather went down I tend to trust those numbers more than the numbers on the Explorer I don't know why we've got that massive of a Divergence so there's a number of active addresses the number of new addresses doesn't look that different the trend is pretty much the same and here we've got the number of addresses depositing to exchanges so it's very unlikely that we've got manipulation in those numbers and so again directly on polygon scan we see a quite stable number of transactions we even see how the number of transfers for erc20 tokens Rises and the gas usage is pretty stable so what other potential sources do we have let's have a look at Dex screener so Dex is a nice Explorer to look at all kinds of tokens and all kinds of blockchains and polygon in the last 24 hours had trading volume worth of 122 million the binance smart chain had 855 million arbitrum had 582 million ethereum more than a billion and Solana also slightly more than a billion one should expect that a cheaper chain has more transactions right because it doesn't cost that much to move funds there are more Arbitrage opportun unities Etc but it appears as if the low transaction cost on polygon can't really help the transaction volume again for me this seems to be inflated this seems to be the real story because it aligns with all kinds of other metrics as well and so that's the problem with altcoins in general right there's more more Layer Two Solutions on top of ethereum they're all competing for the same kind of dollar and in the end the capital get spread out across more and more chains it appears as if polygon is not getting out of this as a winner I publish videos on polygon regularly on this channel if

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #bobanetwork #altcoin #crypto","the rally in Bobba network is not stopping we're climbing from high to the next high to the next let's have a look at what's driving all of this let's have a look at supply and demand let's look at the toomics is Supply expanding let's have a look at who's buying is this retail is this the Wales let's have a look at all of those very important metrics the price is at $15 we up almost 20% today this week we more than doubled and this month we more than fourx but things haven't always been that Rosy for Boba right the bare Market really crashed the price but it wasn't just the bare Market the tokenomics or more precisely the token Supply development wasn't that pretty now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just running you through the website like other YouTubers this is not how we can get an edge in the market we want to know more than others even looking at complex technical diagrams is not going to cut it we simply just want to know will the price go up or down and again that's only dependent on supply versus demand let's look at the supply now this is Cryptor rank. and it shows us potential token unlocks so here's the allocation of all of the tokens over here in this column we see the unlocked tokens and on the right we see the locked tokens so there's still 18% locked in the treasury 9% locked for the team and 4% locked for investors for the team and investors we're pretty much just halfway through and so this is then how that looks over time this is mesari and it shows the number of circulating Boba Network tokens over time at the beginning of 2022 we were at 155 million tokens now we more than doubled that and if the demand doesn't more than double at the same time then of course the price goes down we can also see this nicely on chain this is the holder distribution pie chart directly on chain on ether scan and the largest of the holding wallets is a vesting Supply wallet 25% of all Boba Network tokens are still vesting so those will go to the team or to investors Etc at some point in the future we can also see the development of that wallet over time and this is of course going down as the payouts to those people are made so some vesting is fine right the team has to get rewarded somehow but the question is does the supply catch up is the team actually doing a good job have a look at this this is defi Lama this is the Boba Network and at some point there was more than 600 million total value locked on that chain the bare Market crushed that total value locked but there wasn't really much of recovery we are still just at 7 million so a drop of 99% now is the team still working on Boba Network because that could potentially create new Demand right if the team releases new product that would be good potentially so what we've got over here is the GitHub repository so this is the place where programmers submit their code changes and yes we do see luckily some activity an update 1 hour ago over here another update 5 hours ago 6 hours ago 16 hours ago so yes there is activity there might be some hope and so with that recent price R who's actually buying here is this small retail is this the Wales is this manipulation let's have a close look on chain I have built a tool that distinguishes retail from the whale wallets it's available to the premium members link is down below the bitcoin.com you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 Boba Network tokens at the curent price that's $1,050 in the middle we see the number of wallets that hold at least 10,000 tokens that's mediumsized retail on the right we see the whales this is the number of wallets that hold at least 100,000 Boba tokens all of those wallets are somewhat long-term accumulating but again those are very long-term charts they start in 2021 and despite the number of investors growing over time the price developed like this right the growth wasn't fast enough to offset all of that vesting but times are different now right and we are in a rally we up a lot this month we for AED in the price what happened to the number of holders here are the same charts but just for the last month now I'm not sure if it makes too much sense to look too closely at those massive drops here because this could have several reasons it could mean some people move their tokens to a centralized exchange to potentially trade them there it could mean that a staking product had been launched it could mean a whole bunch of things but what I don't like is that even before that crash we barely saw accumulation in the last month even the number of retail wallets didn't grow the number of mediumsized retail grew somewhat but by no means enough to justify that rally the number of whale wallets even declined and so isn't that puzzling right we don't see more investors jumping onto the token but at the same time in the the last month the price for exed what happens here I think that it's people with very Deep Pockets that might be trading Bobba and those Deep Pockets are probably on centralized exchanges potentially manipulating the price most trading happens on gate.io coinbase is the second then we've got bid then we've got Q coin on top of the spot Market we also have the Perpetual Futures Market bybit is leading the party ext.com is closely Following xd.com being a wh labeled binance so all the action is happening on bit probably I personally don't like the I prefer to see onchain accumulation I prefer to see the transactions that actually underpin a rally I don't like the rally coming from a hidden place so the black boxes the centralized exchanges it makes it very hard to do datadriven decisions and so when you combine all of this the long-term underperformance because of the ever growing Supply that's not going to stop anytime soon with a total value locked that's a shadow of its former self with a lot of trading volume happening on centralized exchanges where we don't see data then I'm not sure if it makes sense to hope for the price to appreciate just based on the developer activity now I might be wrong I have been wrong plenty of times but if you found this information useful feel fre to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down

what's happening who's buying and who's specifically selling let's have a look at some onchain metrics to figure out whether or not makes sense to get into this dip now we are currently at 7.7 CS down 21.5% and the long-term chart does look a little bit like a pump and dump it's interesting to note that the number of buyers and sellers is almost equal today so it's simply people taking profit the sell volume is higher than the buy volume it's not necessarily more people getting out the people that sell simply move more money now let's figure out how much of this price action is natural or how much might be manipulation we don't get this answer from the website the website is pretty useless so is the white paper by the way but the onchain metrics are useful we've got 6,000 holders roughly on the Solana chain and that compares to interestingly enough 11,000 followers on Twitter so this doesn't necessarily look like a natural number right how is it possible that there's more followers on Twitter than there is people that bought the token on chain the number of telegram members is 3,000 that makes a bit more sense so one out of two holders also follows the telegram Channel now for any altcoin to long-term appreciate in price we need to have a growing investor base right we need to have more and more people that buy into the token thus I very much like to look at the daily number of new Traders versus recurring Traders I look at this metric almost on every video on this channel here it is again on the left side the number of new users versus recurring users on the right side the number of transactions per day and initially we had a lot of adoption we had way more firsttime Traders than recurring Traders up until the 3rd of November and that's also when the price very very quickly approv appreciate by 1,300% now this tends to turn around somewhat we still see a lot of firsttime Traders but we are equaling the number of recurring Traders and of course if there's more recurring Traders relative to firsttime Traders and most of those recurring Traders are in massive gains then the selling per seller tends to be higher than the buying per buyer we now need to see more buyers relative to sellers just to keep the price stable that's probably one of the reasons for this decline now what's interesting is that despite the number of new Traders going down that the number of transactions yesterday Peak now we can ignore the latest data point over here because the day has just started we have seen a lot of transactions yesterday and who's making those transactions it's mainly the Wales so on the left side we see the trading volume in US Dollar on the right side we also see the trading volume but here normalized to 100% per day so what we can see over over time is that the large retail wallets so the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token they tend to make up more and more of the trading volume whereas the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token tend to trade less and less relatively speaking and so we can count the number of retail wallets versus the number of whale wallets and there is still very rapid adoption by retail on a single day we see growth of 10% roughly we don't see this in the number of whale wallets but we do see more trading volume by the whale wallets in other words some whales are probably selling or some existing whales are dollar cost averaging in but there are not new whales entering the space and so here is why I believe it's so important to see more and more new people coming in to see a lot of small retail investors coming in retail investors tend to not take profit that quickly they tend to simply just buy and hold and potentially forget check out the token balance that's held by small retail it barely goes down most of the time it goes up mediumsized retail also sees mainly accumulation there's now $4 million worth in those wallet now large retail of course also holds more of the token $18 million worth but when we look at the Wales their token balance really went down from 95 million to currently 69 million so the Wales are taking profit that's what's causing this drop now I don't have a crystal ball either where this price is going what I found interesting though is that none of the wallets that we are tracking in premium it's more than 400 wallets bought the token so this is something very unusual instead we've seen for example how the peanut token got bought that was for 3 Cents by Crypt bent on the third of November since then we are up more than 1,000% and so here's why Crypt banter has 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token they move the price and so of course they always buy the token before announce this on their YouTube or on their Twitter and so that's why we track those wallets we've got 33 wallets by Crypt benter alone we've got 421 wallets in total that we currently track and so those are the kinds of tokens that I believe have the most upside for example recently I got some feedback by a new Joiner he's already going through the wallet alert channels through the notifications and it's already paying off and so in total we've got more than a 100 tutorial videos eight of those videos are just about wallet tracking on how to find influencer wallets and how to then afterwards also interpret the signals that we get from all of that wallet tracking we also discussed the different alt coins when to buy and when to sell in dedicated Chets so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund to you 100% so it appears as if Z real BR is currently a pump and dump by the whales the whales are definitely dumping on retail while the number of retail investors still continues growing if you got some value out this video feel free to subscribe I proba youly like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT06HjK2xc0,"['Solana', 'JUST', 'Zerebro',

so that's 177% in the last month though we saw an appreciation of 50% now this is strange have a look at this chart this is the total value locked on the ontology chain this is measured in US dollars but even measured in entt tokens there is no positive momentum what whatever this is true both for the ontology chain but also for the ontology evm chain there's really no decentralized app that's interesting in any shape or form Wing Finance is available on five other chains I've used it it's a very standard boring and Landing platform without any real Innovation now we will dive into this in a bit more detail it doesn't look like the project is getting anywhere but the price suddenly is shooting up I think there is a potential opportunity here and again it's not because of fundamentals here a few more fundamentals this is the activity on GitHub on the developer platform how many code changes are really being made the last change 2 weeks ago another one 2 weeks ago one on November 23rd one on August 21st just based on that we can already see how antology isn't moving to any greener pastures the number of Reddit subscribers isn't growing the number of telegram users is even shrinking and so who's pushing up the price who's buying here actually in Agate I think it's the centralized exchanges and they might be doing this because of one reason check this out ontologies oent token distribution and lock periods a medium article we can see here that all of the ENT tokens have already unlocked so there's no more Supply expansion this is the circulating Supply over time that's great for centralized exchanges because they can simply hold the token and not worry about token d illusion in other words if the bances of this world were to hold the majority of the token and the token wouldn't be traded that much on a decentralized exchange anymore then they could open the floodgates to price manipulation again and maybe this will happen to some degree to on as well as it has happened for example for y Finance or as it is currently happening for Tor the trb token ontology is held on several chains but most holders are on the binance smart chain let's have a look at who's buying and who's selling the token this is a tool I have built myself that's available also for the premium members together with a tutorial video if you're interested in that feel free to check out the Bitcoin strategy.com link is down below here what this is showing is the number of holders that have at least 100 tokens on the left 1,000 tokens in the middle and 10,000 tokens on the right at the current price 100 tokens means $33 so pretty much small retail it's $330 in the middle it's $3,300 on the right notice there is only 76 such Wallets on chain and that's not even that much Capital we see a bit of accumulation Happening by the small guys less accumulation Happening by the medium-sized people and the Wales quote unquote didn't buy whatsoever in the last weeks and months and the reason why they didn't buy onchain is simply because there is no liquidity the largest liquidity pool for ontology is 57 $1,000 only so the trading is already very much concentrated in the centralized exchange hands here have a look at this table 40% of trading volume on binance alone another 11% on okx and the rest are all smaller centralized exchanges as well on top of that we've also got a derivatives Market binance of course leading here with a 24hour trading volume of 191 million so all almost every entt token because the market cap is 257 million has changed hands in the form of derivatives on binance in the last 24 hours alone so the price is already getting manipulated now the big question is how long can that manipulation continue if it continues for quite a while then the price of ENT could potentially double triple and even 4X from here whether or not that happens is 100% in the hands of those centralized exchanges and among them mainly in the hands of binance because there is a first glimmer of manipulation in ontology and because we have seen that much manipulation in trb and in un Finance for example I will be making a bet here I never buy or sell before releasing a video if I do a buy or sale in an asset that I'm talking about here on this YouTube channel I will be doing that transaction after releasing several hours after releasing and for this case here for ontology I will make a better I will buy some ENT again this is not based on fundamentals this is not because I believe this chain is going anywhere this is simply because I see a beginning of manipulation by binance and if this catches on this could potentially go much much higher if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much

this run is sustainable and what's driving all of this this is the rally I'm talking about more than 250% even in the last month now Moon River is the Smart contract platform on kusama and kusama is the playground for poad do and so we're looking here at several layers of risks stacked on top of each other first there's poad do then there's kusama then there is Moon River and so it doesn't surprise that if po dot goes up kusama goes up more and Moon River goes up even more than that this is what we see in the price charts as well this here is poka dot relative to ethereum so we're not looking at the US dollar chart we're looking at the chart relative to e and that matters because we want outperformance right we are getting into something more risky than ethereum in order to gain more performance right if you only get ethereum's performance why not simply just buy e you buy something like polka dot something more risky something that doesn't have as much adoption because you want to get more performance and so when Bitcoin goes up when ethereum goes up then of course all the altcoins go up as well and vice versa the question is always is there outperformance by taking on more risk now most of the time that was not true for Poka do but since the beginning of October that has changed and that's actually not a surprise if you're following this channel for a while you know that something happened at the beginning of October in the stablecoin market if you're very new here and you don't know what I'm talking about feel free to check out other videos on this channel now this is poad do relative to ethereum this is kusama relative to ethereum now poka do did underperform Eve in the bare Market 90% but kusama is pretty much like a levered version on this minus 96.5% now Moon River takes this to the extreme the bare Market destroyed the capital by 97.6% so the movements happen in both directions when we're in a bare Market the movements get Amplified to the downside but the same is true now that we are in a bull market Moon River tends to go up more than kusama which tends to go up more than ethereum here this is Moon River red relative to kusama and it outperformed by more than 100% 115 this is kusama relative to pokadot also outperformed recently by 50% but besides that inherent leverage that obviously lets Moon River now push harder what's the explanation for this massive massive underperformance is this really just risk aversion by the market during bearish times I'm not so sure look at the circulating supply of Moon River over time this went up by more than 45% in the last year alone a very constant very massive increase in a bit more than 2 years the circulating Supply went from 1.9 million all the way to 8.7 million and if the demand doesn't grow as quickly of course the performance has to suffer especially relative to ethereum because even though Moon River might go up when the rest of the market goes up relative to ethereum it cannot outperform when the supply increases that quickly here is Moon River's total value locked over time this is in US Dollars it was once at almost 400 million ion now it's at 11 million but even measured in Moon River tokens not in US Dollars this also went down significantly from 9 million Moon River tokens to half a million only the inflation of the dot token itself of poka dot isn't that bad though Moon River's inflation is very bad poot inflation isn't that bad they're currently at 1.4 billion tokens and one year from now this will be at 1.55 billion roughly so what does this tell us it tells us that it's very very dangerous to hold something like Moon River outside of a bull market that being said we are currently in the bull market the altcoins tend to outperform everything else people are deploying their dollars for crypto again the stable coin market cap is expanding more and more tether is being printed and that's a reflection of people simply depositing their hard-earned cash into centralized exchanges for example that then move this forward to tether that then prints the tokens creates the tokens my approach to Ries like this is to take at least a mental trailing stop loss so you look at how is the price rising and you try to take profit at as long as we keep on Rising and the price drops by say 20 or 30% more than the historical volatility then you want to be exiting very fast because long-term obviously that token Supply will again depress the price at some point for now though the music is playing and so this R can continue for quite a while as long as there is hype around pokka do if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe there's also a free telegram link is down

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #trias #altcoin #crypto","Trias is it that Hidden Gem in the cryptocurrency world there are some things I really really love about the token and others I incredibly hate and I will share both of those things here the first thing to like is obviously this rally more than a 10x last year most of it happened in the last month now things didn't always look that Rosy during the bare Market the price went from $24 all the way down to less than $1 but here's the first interesting thing this is the price chart but have a look at the corresponding market cap chart trius was never that large in terms of market cap so the circulating supply seems to have grown over time I was not able to find a reliable circulating Supply chart though but I will show you the data I got from my own tools here's something interesting the token isn't yet that widely spread across centralized exchanges qoin has the major share of trading but there's still massive trading happening also in a decentralized manner and that's good it's good that we've got activity on the blockchain directly because then we can see what are the small holders doing what are the whales doing what's actually moving that price now here's something embarrassing for the Trias team they announced just recently a launch of a new website on December 30th Trias do1 you click on that link and what do you see as you see there is nothing the website went down the person responsible for that new website probably took a holiday break and didn't bother to fix this now any YouTuber can show you the broken website any YouTuber can show you the price chart this video though has data that other YouTubers will not show you we'll find out who is currently buying the token is it small retail or is it Wales the answer is in the charts behind me a tool that I've built myself that you can get access to as well in the premium membership so that's the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below as well on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 10 Trea tokens but it's currently $150 worth of the token so small retail with a bit of play money in it in the middle we've got the number of holders that have 10 times that 100 tokens so that's $1,500 worth of the token another 10x on the right ,000 tokens so $115,000 worth of the token currently there are roughly ,000 holders and this is a bit over the top 10% of those holders what do we see we see retail is buying massively both small retail and medium-sized retail we also see that the whales purchase quite heavily at the beginning they aren't participating in the current rally that much but they're also not selling off so we've seen a 10x in price in the last year most of it happening in the last month and the big big guys are not letting go of their tokens at least in aggregate now there's a very confusing situation around the circulating Supply and if you've got an answer to this please comment this down below I will show you what I have here first of all coin market cap implies an increase in circulating Supply right otherwise the market cap wouldn't be at all-time highs while the price is not on top of that we see a total supply of 10 million with a circulating supply of 9.7 million now my onchain tool shows a minted supply of 10 million so this is in line with what coin Market cap says but it's not increasing whatsoever right this was always 10 million another very interesting point is when we look at the largest holders that's over here the largest wallet has 5 million tokens and that wallet is a burner wallet it's a debt wallet so of those 10 million at least 5 million are not accessible anymore so what is it is it a growing Supply as implied by the market cap chart of coin market cap is it a constant supply of 10 million at as implied by the onchain minting events or is it even 5 million of circulating Supply with half of the tokens already being burned since they are held in a dead wallet if you know what's going on here feel free to share this again down below in the comments it will help the entire Community that's looking for Trias now here's another thing I very much like and that's the chart behind me this is Trias relative to ethereum I don't like to look at altcoin charts just in bare US dollars because you want to know how much outperformance are you getting for taking on more risk and ethereum tends to be higher correlat to altcoins than Bitcoin is and Trias did outperform versus Eve by 1, 250% roughly this is very very positive over such a long period of time most altcoins do not outperform e so there's two ways to interpret this right on the one hand there's potentially an upper ceiling here because we did see a crash at that level in the past but I rather see this as a positive I don't think we have to necessarily bounce off that potential resistance and the reason for that is the small market cap 150 million fully diluted but very likely it's just half of the size really because again all of that dead Supply there's lots of other useful information in this tool for example the first wallets that received the token or the first wallets that traded the token those might be potential insiders and it's always interesting to see what are those wallets actually doing with the token now so again that's the bitcoin.com feel free to subscribe if it's your first time here a like would very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down

Prediction,Ton longterm,Ton Tokenomics  #ton #toncoin #crypto",it is very easy to overlook ton coin there was pretty much no price action whatsoever in the last month we went sideways however the over Market itself imploded so ton coin did pretty well relative to bitcoin for example and that's not just during the bare Market even in the last year where Bitcoin almost doubled ton coin more than 5x now where does this outperformance come from let's have a look at relative valuation metrics long-term let's have a look at some on data most people aren't considering let's see why capital is flowing into ton so check this out this is Def Lama and it shows us the total value locks development of various blockchains over different time frames and when we look at the last month all blockchains but ton lost value it's clearly a Winner Takes most game ton grew its total value locked by almost 60% the rest lost total value locked somewhere between 7% and 4 6% and so that's then how that looks like on a chart this is the total value locked of ton over time this is measured in US Dollars we did see a bit of a hiccup in US dollars in the last few days measured in ton though we don't see that hiccup we see continued growth we are now at an all-time high in total value locked measured in ton tokens now the big question with any altcoin especially in a bare Market where we don't see a lot of capital inflows the big question is always to economics how much is potentially the the token diluting how much more Supply could hit the market and at first glance this doesn't look that great because the circulating Supply is 2.5 billion ton tokens the total Supply is 5.1 billion so we've got pretty much a 2X in Supply that's going to hit the market but here's the thing that Supply will not hit the market very soon again this is defi Lama this is the T N locker and we had a lot of token inflation in 2021 and partially in 2022 now we are going flat and only until end of 2025 do we see some kind of increase again now let's overlay this with the price and market cap chart and have a look at how nicely this correlates when the supply goes up the price and market cap tend to go down when the supply doesn't grow anymore then there is potential room for growth in other words there is a real chance that very long term in 2026 20 27 and 2028 the price could again as it did in the past underperform ethereum and Bitcoin the largest defi protocol on the ton blockchain is dust dust has 358 million in total value locked here's the total value locked development over time and the reason why dust is attracting so much capital is because the trading volume is high thus the A on depositing ton with tether for example are comparatively elevated if you deploy half ton half usdt on Dust you get an apri of 72% on tokens that are not inflationary now I always like to look at relative valuation charts right because when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up then all the altcoins tend to go up as well and vice versa so what we actually want to do is we want to see at an altcoin performance relative to ethereum or relative to bitcoin right we want to get this extra risk that we take on by buying altcoin we want to get that extra risk paid for now most people only look at the relative valuation to bitcoin I personally prefer relative valuations to ethereum and here is why have a look at the correlation coefficients of various altcoins to bitcoin and to ethereum so the First Column versus the second column the First Column tends to have lower numbers compared to the second column in other words the alt coins tend to move more in sync with ethereum they're higher correlated with ethereum compared to bitcoin and that makes sense right people that get into ethereum tend to be more active crypto participants people that buy Bitcoin simply just buy and hold and so there is just from a market psychology perspective already a better connection between Eve and the alts so let's outperform Eve let's look at ton relative to ethereum the Chart behind me this goes in an interesting trading range with quiet a bit of volatility from bottom to top we've got a more than 300% rally outperformance versus ethereum from Top top to bottom we see an underperformance of 71% so massive ups and downs over the long term rather increasing currently we are somewhat elevated we aren't though at maximum Heights yet that are another 35% or so away from here can this long-term Trend break could we potentially go even higher yes of course we could especially if we continue to see ton outperforming in terms of adoption versus the other chains unfortunately we haven't seen that much in the last 7 days but i''s simply just keep an eye on this here's another interesting way to look at relative valuation this here is ton dominance so how much of all of cryptocurrency market cap is locked up in ton ton currently is the eighth largest cryptocurrency it's got a market cap of 18 billion and with that 0.9% roughly of all of crypto is in ton again we see this long-term upwards Trend those lines are not necessarily science but sometimes they do become self-fulfilling profit phes and with this metric we are even more balanced we are not that expensive which is very different to the relative ethereum valuation chart I'm planning to continue to do updates on ton in case you're interested in that feel free to subscribe I publish use regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram feel free to join us the link is down

this is the long-term price chart a clear destruction of capital here is the long-term market cap chart see how we can see the rally here a bit clearer on this chart compared to this chart the market cap Rose more relatively speaking than the price and that's because of token inflation there are still token inflation in the spell token more and more Supply hits the market depressing the price right now only half of spell tokens are circulating and here's the circulating Supply over time we went from a bit under 15 billion to more than 130 billion so the supply roughly at xed in the span of 3 years and that's then why we get chart like this this is the spell token relative to ethereum I like to look at relative valuations right because crypto in general goes up and down and expands and contracts and sometimes when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up then of course a lot of altcoins go up as well I want to know the outperformance longterm and that's what we see here this is spell divided by ethereum the relative performance and the massive token inflation of course did not help the price from top to bottom it went down by more than 95% relative to Eve if we take the last rally it's an underperformance of quotequote only 90% now let's talk about fundamentals for a second spell is the incentive Token for Magic internet money which is a stable coin that's not the prettiest stable coin but it allows for a lot of Leverage so this is the stable coin fluctuations in the last year we sometimes overshoot we sometimes undershoot we even see those fluctuations in the last month right a deack of like 4% or so a proper stable coin should be way closer to $1 but still people use it it because you can put leverage on top of Leverage on top of Leverage you can pretty much squeeze out the last little bit of performance in a position that you have high conviction in now magic internet money and spell is based on Abracadabra and Phantom used to be the largest chain for magic internet money this has changed because the main bridge that allowed capital inflows and outflows out of phantom it got hacked the money got lost somewhere in China and so now the main chain is ethereum it's $137 million of total value locked of capital in abbacadabra but at some point in time that was almost 7 billion so yes I do understand bare markets I do understand how Capital flows out of protocols in bare markets but not to that degree there might be some recovery recently but still right people got absolutely crushed and actually even the recovery is barely visible we're pretty much just going sideways and so all of that data backs the question why is the price Rising so so much of course we are in an ALT rally of course Bitcoin is close to alltime highs of course there is capital flowing into the system but why specifically spell why is spell outperforming the centeral question is who is buying here let's have a look on chain because this is what I like to do on this channel I like to look at retail investors versus whale investors I like to look at who is buying and this is a tool that I've developed myself and that I make available to the premium members so the link is down below Bitcoin trade.com feel free to check it out we have very long-term charts here and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least $1,000 worth of the spell token at the current prices so that's 700,000 tokens roughly this is what I'd consider retail on the ethereum Chain because any positions below $1,000 are pretty much not worth it because of the gas fees now in the middle we've got medium-sized retail that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token token all of those are very long-term charts all of those show very erratic Behavior not really long-term accumulation but we want to know what happened in the last month why did the price almost 3x and so let's have a look at the same charts but only for the last month the number of retail wallets did not grow the number of medium-sized retail even Shrunk the number of whales also pretty much is stable how can the price go up when nobody is buying on chain when the number of investors is not growing it must be the existing investors buying right or it must be people with very Deep Pockets buying it might be manipulation manipulation by whom I believe it's market makers or potentially even binance itself CU have a look at the following there's a strong misconception in crypto most people believe that decentralized exchanges only hold the tokens that their customers hold right they only hold them custody that's not true centralized exchanges also hold tokens for Market Mak making and when a token crushed that much then maybe it's possible to generate some kind of attention with a price rally and then sell some of that off have a look at this most trading volume happens on binance now pretty much 40% of all of trading volume in the last 24 hours was there and on top of that we've also got a Perpetual Futures market so those are derivative contracts those are bets on the price so on the one hand you own a lot of the token on the other hand you also offer bets on the token price you own the referee and you offer the bets that's how crypto works this is how manipulation is born binance makes money from liquidations of course and so when a lot of people bet on Rising prices they crash the price and vice versa and so can this really continue yes of course it can but it's not in the hand of the broad masses it's in the hand of a few key people at binance this is not broad adoption otherwise we would see this on chain as well we don't see the number of investors going up even though the price almost tripled if it's a time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also free telegram link is down

now does it make sense to still jump on this rally who's actually triggering this R who's buying here is this small retail is this the Wales let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here are the top trending tokens on Solana and they are ordered by liquidity and moodang is one of the top performers among the largest tokens now this is not the first video on moodang on this channel I actually published three videos before this one now that first video didn't get initially that much traction but then with the price rise it started to pick up the subsequent video for the ethereum based moodang performed pretty poorly so that gives us a hint that retail interest into the ebased moodang isn't really that high the prices are not coupled so if you consider buying moodang don't pick the ethereum based one at least just based on those numbers the third video on moodang then finally took off this is always how it works with crypto and YouTube right once the investor base grows of course the video will also get more popularity unfortunately it's the best to buy when the token is still not that popular right that first video was published when mudang was still at 20 cents now it's at 62 cents and so even though the YouTube algorithm is against me even though if I publish videos on smaller tokens it might not get as many views I still think it's important it's important to provide enough value so feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various mem coins regularly here just have a look at this and compare how those tokens performed relative to the rest of the market now here is how I always start an analysis and I think it's a very good thing to do for everybody you don't need any fancy tooling simply go to dexc screen.com and look at this data over here first of all we see the price action today of course plus 45% but then we can also see what's behind that price action we see an overhang of 52% buyers versus 48% sellers but at the same time we see that the buying volume isn't that different to the selling volume there's only a Delta of roughly a million dollar in other words the sellers tend to have larger transactions than the buyers even though there are more buyers way more buyers if there wasn't that much profit taking the price would go up way more now let's have a look at what's going on on chain let's look into the details of those 53,000 holders now here's something I look at for pretty much any video on this channel and that's the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on a day and the number of transactions per day there's something very interesting happening since the 9th of November the number of firsttime Traders exceeds the number of recurring Traders again with it accelerating on the 13th of November now here is the 9th of November and here is the 13th of November this is something we very often see whenever new people enter the token the price subsequently tends to Rally in other words if there's more adoption by small retail the Wales notice this and they buy up even more now this trend continues so this is very very positive for the price at the same time we also see how the number of token transactions goes up so that's also another measure of attention grow growing which in turn means that the price can stabilize at a higher level and so here is how I see crypto crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more the capital overtime accumulates towards the people that are very skilled right the less important the luck component becomes thus once we see Wales buying more and more of a token that's a positive sign right the people that know how to play the game they accumulating thus the price is more likely to go up and so what we've got over here is the trading volume split up by different trade segments by different wallet sizes on the left side simply in US Dollars on the right side normalized to 100% per trading day and as so often we see attention coming in waves ideally you want to be selling when attention is at a peak and you want to be buying when attention is at a low currently we are building up attention again now we can ignore this latest data point over here because the day isn't yet over but what we can also see is that as a fraction of all of trading volume the larger wallets tend to make up more and more of trading small retail so the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token make up less and less now the numbers are a bit skewed because we do have centralized exchange listings of mooding so on the left side we see on chain the number of holders that have at least 2,000 mooding tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,200 in the middle we see the number of holders with 20,000 tokens so $112,000 worth of the token and on the right $120,000 worth of the token what happened over here it's a centralized exchange listing so some people move their mooding token over to the max Casas of this world and so what's better than just looking at these kind of graphs is to look at how many holders are there now relatively speaking in those different segments and we can see that over time the number of whales and the number of large retail wallets tended to go up there's less and less small retail wallets and of course this crash that we see over here is the listing again we see that over time even after the listing the whales tend to buy more and more now there's a common misconception most people think that currently the altcoins outperform everything else but that can't be further from the truth the altcoin market as a whole is actually underperforming have a look at this this is the others dominance this is the market cap of all altcoins that are not in the top 10 and this went down since beginning of the year by more than 30% at the same time the Bitcoin dominance went up so Bitcoin as a fraction of all of crypto becomes larger and larger the reason why it feels so different is because your probably already active in the segment of crypto that is outperforming now we can look at this in a more differentiated way but here are the different categories within crypto that performed the best in the last week number one is the zoo themed tokens number two is the pump. fun ecosystem now within the zoo themed tokens number one is Peanut which is also a pump. fun ecosystem token and number two is mooding and so it appears as if the Launchpad on Solana the mem coin Launchpad tend to do the best and within that Launchpad it's the zoo themed tokens because again both of those tokens come from pump. fun now here is another misconception most people think that buying and selling meme coins is simply just gambling it's just a matter of luck and that's true if you don't know what you're doing but there is a skill component to this we've already looked at the onchain analytics we've already looked at discovering who's currently driving the prices but what we can also do is we can dive even deeper we can track individual wallets and so have a look at this here this is an alert that influencer AI Lim bought the moodang token for 24 here's that influencer he's got 71,000 subscribers and again 24 cents isn't a bad entry given that we are up more than 160% since then I have a look at this this is the peanut token so the largest of the pump fun ecosystem tokens we've got a signal here that Crypt Benta bought peanut for 3 cents since then the price went up by more than 5,000 %. now here is the Cryptor Channel they've got more than a million subscribers and whenever they talk about a token of course attention goes up and with increased attention the price tends to go up as well and so the skill component in all of this is to find out what influencer owns what kind of wallet to then track those wallets and to then properly interpret those signals we've got 33 wallets by Crypt banter alone in total we track more than 400 wallets and so I really believe in the strategy I've made a tutorial section just on that topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we track them and how can we interpret the signals it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the bitcoins.com it's not just about wallet tracking right it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about portfolio diversification it's about back testing there's more than a 100 different videos in premium and so once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to update our on analytics Etc for that we've got individual altcoin chats within premium as well so if feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first s days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so can mudang go higher yes I believe it can because the smart money the Wales they continue to buy is it the very best upside I'm not sure because the market cap is already large I believe most upside is in the very very small coins if if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish you sely a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next

the site wave update for flare on this video I'm going to go over the larger term time frames as well as the smaller term time frames and I just want to discuss the two larger time frame patterns I'm expecting in the bullish scenario so in the bullish scenario we either have our bottom of our correction and start of our Trend at 1.2 now in this scenario we started in a correction and we ended as a running flat whatever the count was previous that didn't exist if you will so this is the start of our correction higher b-wave and we protected our a-wave so running flat so that's the bullish scenario in which case we'd start a trend from here to alltime highs uh looking for a large series of five wve move now in the less bullish scenario I hope we don't get this one this is either a correction as a wxy and we're just going to be chopping for years in a sideways Market or it's a diagonal and our bottom was over here in which case I wouldn't expect further upside than say 14 15 cents and this would make it larger Wave 1 and two but we're talking years down the road before that setup comes so obviously obviously still good upside we're talking you know 500% that's still obviously very good but obviously we prefer the start of the trend right here and this being a running flat so we're going to play this until it fails now before I get into the smaller time frames this is from last video we're looking for our third wave in white to complete and then another fourth in white and a fifth to the upside and then a four five in green so going to today's chart that was right here and you can see we got our 45 as a flat and our fifth wave to our Target now there's a couple counts here because this is a little bit difficult so right now have this labeled as 1 2 3 four working on four and then we look for a fifth wave for our third in blue which would create our 1 2 3 4 5 as you can see um but the deepness of this fourth wave is making me start to second guess the count so there are some Alternatives I'm going to show you but right now what I would expect this to turn into is either a triangle or a flat something like that before we get our fifth this is a pretty sharp correction and it looks corrective off this pivot so it would need to turn into something more complex as has a 4 five running flat or a triangle wave four um invalidation or sorry unlikely to be a fourth if we Dro below this 50% at 1. 1933 cents and inv validation of that at this Wave 1 overlap so this is my first count this is what I would like to see pan out but there is another count that would be like this the only difference is how you count this area is it as a expanded flat wave 1 or or sorry an expanded diagonal Wave 1 or is it a running flat with a sharp c-wave in this instance this is our one 2 3 4 five and we've completed the third wave in green coming to the extreme extension of the 3618 extension of wave 1 off of Wave 2 so in this case we'd want to hold above 1.89 2 cents same thing looking for flats or triangles and we'd only expect one more wave up before completing our larger one and two expecting a larger pullback so you can see the difference here and there is one more count unfortunately this is just the way it is sometimes and that is I'll do that in real time Discord member asked me for this that's why it's up here on YouTube today um just to give him Insight here the last scenario is a combination of both and I know it's frustrating not to have Clarity but it's kind of the way it is is sometimes and that is that this would become a very ugly diagonal wave 1 because all our FIB levels uh match up we just get an extreme wave one here this would be a double zigzag Wave 1 2 3 4 five so it would be like this one two uh that would be our running flat three four five like that so it's it's a little bit ugly right and we're in between both counts I'll show you those pivots too because they work as well as the other ones as you can see third wave hits our 1.618 standard extension for our wave three and our 200 our wave five comes between our 200 and 2.23 six so in this scenario if it is complete we'd expect a larger pullback and more time so this is my last alternative um so we'd pull our fibs from beginning of wave one off of the end of wave five like so we look for our wave two and most common areas for that is between the 50 and the 786 in validation at this low at 1.2 so this becomes my primary as soon as we drop below let me get rid of these that my ALT right now so we can get rid of that so as soon as we drop below these two counts 1 82 892 cents I assume that this one's in play our wave two and I'd be looking for Longs making this a larger one and two but anyways my bias is bullish just to be clear very bullish it's just are we complete a five-wave move do we need another four five it all depends what happens in this area and as you can see the difficulty of this region here can be counted many different ways which makes it a little bit difficult so me personally um if I was just holding spot I I would just continue to hold myself nothing to worry about there or if I were in trades I wouldn't want my stop past that 1.8 892 without considering a lower entry for our Wave 2 hopefully that's not too complicated but that's that's the help of Elliot wave and sometimes the frustration when you have multiple counts my job is just to track them and see which one is most likely based on the reaction so I hope this is helpful for those out there I know it's can be a little bit complicating but if we go back out to our daily sorry our 4our it does appear on the 4 Hour like we are in a fourth wave so perhaps we get that move higher this doesn't look like five waves but on the micro you can see the uh ability to be complete so we'll see what we get but I do hope that's our low and we're starting our in the larger degrees or one two three four way up there let's get way up there all right guys if you want to join the private Discord um there's a Link in the description cashing waves.com um that's where I put up a member video every morning it's half an hour to an hour

Meme Coin Breakthrough Will These Tokens Skyrocket #trading #btc #spy #top,join our private in bio,and more importantly they have got huge amounts of holders in a very short period of time and that way it could potentially get listed on some major exchanges and if it does get listed on some major exchanges it could even run much much higher so very much a coin I am also very excited about sitting around $200 million in market cap this is most likely going to be pushing up much much higher and for most of these meme coins guys if you're just looking at Price targets for Brett I think 10 billion is possible if it gets listed on coinbase for slurf a billion is defin easily possible for bu cat also I think a billion is definitely possible and the community is really thinking it is going to hit a billion dollars because a billion dollars is basically $1 in terms of hash buat so yeah really a thing I'm looking forward towards that is going to be playing out in this market,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdXmb9sTMwI,['JUST'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xdXmb9sTMwI/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-30T15:01:08Z

there something fundamental going on who is pushing this this is the rally I'm talking about we're currently at $381 more than 50% up just in the last 24 hours and with that rally we have reached an all-time high I'm not going to bore you with the fundamentals or with discussing the team Etc we have already done this on this channel four months ago on the 5th of August so feel free to check out that video If You're simply looking for the fundamentals I'm not sure though if the fundamentals are the most important thing right now it's altcoin season all kinds of meme coins even are pushing up right now worldcoin might get manipulated but let's look at the onchain data before we go into the nitty-gritty details this is where worldcoin can be traded and the trading volume is very heavily centralized most of trading happens on binance only 0.6% happens on a decentralized exchange and on top of that there is a thriving Perpetual Futures Market a thriving Market with bets on the price where the token itself doesn't even exchange hands the market cap of worldcoin is 400 million the trading volume on those Perpetual Futures on those bets on The Price is more than three times that 1.4 billion so this gives us a first idea of price manipulation this is how the game works you run a sports betting house and you allow people to bet on either team a or Team B winning now on top of having that sports betting house you also have a big impact on the game you bought the referee and you can decide if team a or Team B wins this is pretty much how centralized exchanges use the Perpetual Futures Market centralized exchangers own a lot of the supply of the coin and so they can pump up the price or they can depress the price depending on where most people bet on the Perpetual Futures Market if most customers currently bet on Rising prices then you simply just dump the price you move all of those tokens on a decentralized exchange selling it off crashing the price making those people that bet on Rising prices on the perss get liquidated the same of course works the other way around right when everybody's betting on falling prices then the centralized exchanges can simply buy up more of the supply they already hold so much that they don't have to buy that much to push the price further now that's a story but still let's have a look at some data here worldcoin is an inflating token the number of tokens expands over time relatively quickly and as such the demand for wld has to grow at at least the same rate now who's currently buying the token what do we see on chain it becomes very interesting because this confirms our manipulation thesis on the left side you've got the number of holders that hold at least 0.1 tokens the retail people it's 37 cents worth of the token people just have some residuals from prior swapping left in the middle we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 100 tokens so now we are looking at $379 worth of the token it's only roughly 3,000 Wallets on the right side we've got the number of whales 10,000 tokens 37 $38,000 worth of the coin Now isn't that interesting most demand happens by the small potatoes the way it's also accumulated but not as quickly relatively speaking and we also didn't see on any of those charts the number of holders suddenly shooting up but why did the price shoot up all of that price increase did not happen on chain did not happen in a decentralized manner where people use their Hardware wallets to swap different tokens all of that increase happened on the centralized exchange namely on binance and so yes I do believe that this is price manipulation that being said it's very hard to say how long this manipulation will go on because here's the thing right when this catches on and more and more people are going to trade for world coin then of course binance is incentivized to create even more volatility even more ups and downs generating more fees generating more attention making more money in the process but remember the analogy I used just a few moments ago this is a game where the sports betting house has bought the referee binance can decide where this price will go and so as such I personally do not touch this token whatsoever I don't want to be involved in it no matter if it goes up or down or in circles I do not care I want to get into tokens that have a lot of hype that have a lot of broad adoption where a lot of retail people buy in but also where the whales continue to accumulate and where I don't just see the pumps on the centralized exchanges those are the kinds of tokens that have way more stable trends that you can trade way easier at least in my opinion if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos

is who's buying who's selling how much longer can this really last can we potentially double yet again let's have a look at the potential upside by comparing to other meme coins let's also have a look at onchain metrics let's look at data most people aren't considering so we're currently at 24 cents per frog token we are up 111% in the last month and the reason why frog is so interesting is because it's the fifth largest of the tokens in terms of liquidity among the trending tokens on Solana now when the price goes up like this we obviously see profit taking now when you take profit we obviously pull out more money from the system than we put in in other words as the price Rises very quickly we need more and more buyers getting in compared to the sellers so this is the long-term frog chart and today the price is going up only by 2% although the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers by roughly 117 on chain so the buy and sell volume is almost equal but the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers because the sellers now have more money to sell right the price went up so much and so just a little bit of profit taking can depress the rally quite a bit now on this channel I like to look at onchain metrics so let's start off with the charts here on the left side we see the number of recurring Traders versus firsttime Traders over time and unfortunately we don't see that the number of first-time Traders is growing that quickly in other words initi initially we had more than a, new wallets trading frog per day but now we are down to maybe 500 but we can ignore the current data point the 29th because today is not yet over it looks even more dramatic in the number of token transactions that topped on the 6th of October and is going down very very consistently since then now the 6th of October was over here since then the price still appreciated by 40% so that then backs the question who is buying here what pushing up the price it appears as if the large money is getting more involved the trading volume by the Wales is increasing at least relatively speaking so on the left side we see the trading volume in US dollars per day on the right side we see this normalized to 100% And we don't see that many waves in the trading volume which is good because this tells us that the appreciation is relatively constant and that this is not just hype driven it's not just short-term attention that's pushing up the price and what we also see is that that the whale and large retail wallets tend to take up more and more of the trading volume so initially it was rather 5% or so of trading volume now it's between 10 and 15% now let's have a look at the number of holders segregated by different cohorts but before we do this one more thing I've published a video on frog before on this channel and initially the video actually did not perform that well it underperformed the typical video a typical video is in Gray in the background the blue line is the performance of that first Frog video and we can see that then the performance performance caught up somewhat now why is that it's because the price went up so we went from 12 cents to now 24 cents right we doubled in the price and so that's an effect we see pretty often in YouTube when a token is not yet popular when it's actually a good investment that's when nobody is watching Once the token appreciates and more people search for the token that's potentially when things can get heated here are the videos that work on YouTube xrp will be $112,000 guaranteed or Ani explosion top three cryptos to buy in November a lot of pushing of greed that's what gets the clicks what doesn't get the click is a tutorial on how to make back tests on how to build those sheets that in the end figure out what historically worked well in the past the back test that I often show here on this channel I still very much enjoy producing this kind of content though I also share these kinds of sheets but I don't do it on YouTube you also get direct access to me feel free to check it out it's the Bitcoin strategy so the best price is always when we are early right the best price is when the token is not yet that popular but unfortunately YouTube algorithm is against us so feel free to subscribe potentially even hitting notifications because I publish videos regularly I try to be early and I discuss various meme coins regularly over here now let's go back to the on 10 analytics of frog on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 4,000 frog tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $11,000 worth of the token in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's minimum holding of roughly $10,000 on the right we've got the Wales so roughly $100,000 worth of the token we can see how retail adoption tends to grow over time we can also see how the number of medium-sized retail tends to slightly grow the number of whale wallets is somewhat stagnant now because the whales are not taking profit and it appears they're rather getting more involved over time that's why we see a relatively stable rally now we can also look at this in terms of fractions of how much value is held by those different cohorts and again we see how the smart money how the whales they buy up more and more of the token large retail has less and less of the token medium retail also has less and less of the token the same is true for small retail so even though the number of small retail wallets is increasing they're not increasing fast enough compared to how quickly the big whales that are already in the token accumulate the token so it's the big money that buys up very very fast the way Holdings went from 30 million at the end of September of this year all the way up to 157 million that's more than a 5x but when we look at small retail they increased their holding much less that went from 1.4 million to 2.3 million not even a doubling so the smart money continues to accumulate the smart money buys more and more and that makes me pretty optimistic and so then the big question is if the whales continue accumulating the token at the same time retail buys as well how much potential upside is there at what point in time could this actually turn around and what point in time will people take profit let's compare market caps frock has a market cap of 233 million now that's not really large we can easily double or triple and we'd still be smaller than turbo or book of meme we could quadruple and we'd be in the regions of SPX 6900 or mcoin only at a 5x or 6X would we get into the brats and fies of this world and that's of course quite a bit of a stretch but a doubling or tripling or in other words 50 cents or 75 cents I believe is quite realistic now instead of looking at the entire meme coin Market we can also have a look at simply the Frog themed coins and even in that market a tripling is definitely possible again we would get into regions of Turbo and we'd still be below Brett and pepe now crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more accumulates towards the people that half skill that's why we follow the whales right when the whales are buying that's very positive now what I also like to do is I like to track whales and I like to track influencers so when an influencer buys a token and very often afterwards they might promote that token and when the token gets promoted Say on YouTube a lot of new attention comes onto the token pushing up the price now I personally never do this I never buy a token before publishing a video however a lot of others do it and that's why I track those wallets and so have a look look at this this comes from the premium membership it's part of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com and in here we are tracking various influencers for example Kyle chesse that bought the Frog token already on the 30th of July so that was at 0.15 C or at 0.2 cents it was on the very first day the token got traded since then we are up more than 1,000% and so of course not every trade works that well but still it's good to follow the smart money those 10 x returns don't just happen randomly and so we always get automatic alerts whenever Kyle chesse is buying we've got 12 of his wallets we track more than 400 wallets we've also got 33 wallets by Crypt banter a YouTube channel with more than a million subscribers over here this is Alex Becker we've got 12 of his wallets he's also got I believe a million subscribers or have a look at this Paulo dool not necessarily an influencer but a very very successful Trader he bought Brad for example very very early and so in premium there's even a dedicated video course just how to find those wallets but also how to track them and how to then interpret those signals so there's eight dedicated videos just on that topic and besides that there are more than a 100 other tutorials as well on how to manage risk on how to construct a portfolio on how to do onchain analytics Etc you will also get access to this tool together with a tutorial video so you can plug in your own tokens into this and make your own conclusions so fear free to check it out there are of course also individual Alton chats where we discuss when to buy and when to sell there's also a one week money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% so to sum it all up I believe that the Frog rally is pretty solid retail is buying and the Wales are buying even faster and the whales tend to make the better calls now if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you this regly a like would be very much appreciate as well helps the channel grow looking forward to seeing you in the next video or in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NamFUw7UG8,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'XRP', 'Pepe', 'Turbo', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'WHY',

on this channel let's look at the onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's see who's buying and selling here let's try to find out how much longer this really can last I've been trading Ono Finance as well and I've made several videos on it this is video number one outperformed the regular video quite a bit here's video number two video number three every single video did better than the average video and I hope this one will be no different of course because we looking at data most people aren't considering catching waves early and thus covered Ono when it was already at 28 cents talked about it again at 40 cents then at 89 and here we go now we are at above $1 with of course a bit of drama in between we went sideways for quite a while now there's a reason for this recent rally and that's adoption when we look at the total value locked metric so at the metric that measure how much capital is currently locked up in the Ono fin defi system then this is the impressive chart in January of last year we were pretty much at no total value locked at all and since March of this year this is changing quite a bit more than a 2.5x in the capital on Ono finance and most of this is on the ethereum chain and so I'm not going to walk you through the marketing Des on the website we're not going to look at the fundamentals too much in this video we've already covered that in Prior videos just one very important thing to note the price Dynamics are very like likely going to change in the middle of January of next year when the floating on tokens will more than double so be aware of that unlock prices might Spike and crash and Spike and crash because probably a lot of people are going to bet on falling prices with an increase of Supply but when there is enough speculation around falling prices then short squeezes might happen I'm not going to explain short squeezes again simply think of GameStop right when enough people bet on falling prices then it can be profitable to buy up the price and then Force the people that bet on falling prices to buy back the token for a higher price so if enough people are bearish if enough people bet on falling prices the price might actually go up at least shortterm so be prepared for volatility in both directions in the middle of January of next year now let's look at the more short term let's have a look at why the price is currently going up is this small retail that's buying is this the whales that are pushing out the price what's actually happening here to answer this question I've built a tool that I make available to the premium members if you want to get access to this tool and plug in any ethereum token in this and look at the statistics feel free to check it out it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com is the link and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 Ono tokens so that's what I consider small retail that's roughly $1,000 at the Cur price in the middle we've got mediumsized retail so that's now a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right we've got $100,000 of minimum holding that's what I'd consider the Wales so there are different price Dynamics here we do see more conent accumulation by small retail relative to the large whales but let's zoom in here in the last month let's see what's causing this rally here who is buying yeah the same kind of charts but only for the last month small retail is continuing to accumulate quite a lot the number of small retail investors grew by roughly 20% in the last month the number of mediumsized retail also grew it's a bit less than small retail Maybe by around 12% or so the number of whales went down slightly not much but by roughly 3% so the price of Ono Finance really gets supported by the retail investor and the whale investor tends to rather sell the retail accumulation was also the main reason why I bought into Ono Finance back in the days I've already sold my Stak so I'm not participating in the current rally right now this very short-term rally is also a little bit dangerous there is long-term accumulation by retail that's good but there is one effect that's not so good about these last few days and that effect is described here behind me have a look at the trading volume of Ono Finance what we see here is the Perpetual Futures market so this is not the spot Market this is the derivatives market so the market for levered bets on the price and there is a ton of trading volume on binance in other words there is also manipulation by the Wales here in the very short term the spot Market isn't yet dominated by binance but the Perpetual Futures Market is and so yes I do believe Ono Finance can continue to outperform ethereum but right now in the very short term there is a bit of a danger that this is to a degree also propped up by the Wales this retail accumulation is great but this Perpetual Futures Trading volume isn't and so I believe it's likely that at some point Ono finance will trade again below $1 but in the next months or so if overall crypto stays somewhat healthy then I do think that the US delation of Uno can continue to rise it won't necessarily do another 10 or 100 x for that it's already too large but there is adoption of the real platform there is constant accumulation by small and mediumsized Retail and there's also some degree of support by binance of course that kind of support gets manipulated up and down so be aware of the potential volatility it's not that easy to trade this actively I cover Ono Finance very regularly on this channel

Solana chain there's a lot of meem coins on Solana not so much Defi and so we've got a lot of data around Jupiter we can look on chain at a lot of metrics we can look at adoption we can look at trading volume we can look at buyers and sellers we can actually figure out where potentially the price might go and so here's the rally I'm talking about we are up 28% today alone we are up almost 70% in this week we increased by by 140% almost this month but things didn't always look that positive for Jupiter where did this initial decline come from now the first suspect is always an expanding Supply right if more and more tokens hit the market because there's maybe vesting unlocks then of course this could depress the price and what we see here on coin market cap is pretty worrying only 13.5% of all of Jupiter token are circulating but this is not the entire story have a look at this this is Cryptor rank. and it shows us the allocation of the Jupiter tokens we've got all kinds of allocations and only 12.5% are unlocked but there's a slight mismatch here with coin market cap that says 13.5% are circulating but what are those unlocks and how will the supply expand here is token. unlocks do app and this shows us that actually the jup token did not expand in Supply so far we are constant at 1.35 billion tokens but there is this massive allocation on a cold multisig wallet for the team and for the community and that might become available in February of next year there's probably more details to it potential Milestones that have to be reached so far the supply expansion is not a problem if you're trading somewhat shortterm and don't look too far out in the future now here's something very nice about Jupiter we see here the total value locked since the swap exchange launched and this is constantly increasing very nice this is the US dollar chart though and of course some of that increase is due to the Solana price going up so here's the same chart denominated in s so tokens and here the growth pretty much stalled in the last 3 weeks or so this is again total value lock this is not Usage Now there's all kinds of different products you can do limit orders on Solana you can trate Perpetual Futures with Jupiter let's try to get an idea in what direction the demand for the token and for the platform could develop this is onchain data this is a number of Jupiter total users over time unfortunately this is accumulating so we don't really see how fast the growth is if the growth is accelerating here's a different chart this shows us the daily active users this shows the last month and we had a peak roughly one week ago since then this is unfortunately going down here's the number of swaps pretty much the same development but here's an interesting metric there's another kind of swaps that is actually going up this is spot plus Perpetual Futures Trading this is continuing to grow so it looks like some Jupiter users are migrating over from spot trading to Perpetual Futures Trading so that's the new product that they launched right it's still in beta but even though it's in beta the assets under management for the perss continues to grow very steadily very nicely and so yes there is real demand there is real usage of the platform and this might at least partially explain a lot of the price value now I say a lot and not all and that's because of the following directly on chain Jupiter actually isn't that large anymore when you order by the liquidity pool size then Jupiter is at rank number 34 and all kinds of other random tokens are above that and this is underpinned by this chart this is a tool that I've developed myself it's available for the premium members it shows us on an hourly basis in the last week the number of firsttime traders in the jup token versus recurring Traders and we had a search of firsttime Traders on the 10th of March but the price didn't really move much on the 10th of March so what we're seeing here is after the search of firsttime Traders it was mainly recurring Traders when there are no Central exchanges involved then usually there's a very strong connection between the number of new people that get into a token versus it's future price development because of course an expanding investor base tends to mean more money flows into this tends to mean higher prices so seeing the number of first-time Traders not being very high while the price is suddenly shooting up it's definitely a sign that the centralized exchanges are doing something here and lo and behold when we look at the markets and the trading volume this is now dominated by binance binance has 30 35% of trading volume okx 10% buy bit 9 etc etc it's not anymore the radiums and oras of this world it's not anymore the decentralized exchanges and the onchain activity that moves the Jupiter price and so since we don't have the data right all those centralized exchanges are basically black boxes it's much harder to figure out what's the potential upside here we can of course look at relative valuations so this is now the Jupiter price relative to the Solana price and there we are relatively close to the all-time high from bottom to the current price we went up by 56% this is a chart that starts at the end of January but here's something important I believe that Jupiter is pretty unique in its value proposition a lot of the tokens on Solana right now are simply just memec coin trading people get on the memec coin train and I'm not sure if all investors want to gamble with memecoins some people want to simply just invest in a growing def5 protocol with good reason this is the largest tokens on the Solana chain ordered by liquidity it's all meme book of meme dog with head pop cat Myro smok Pang py Sol geob Balden Etc it's all just Meme and we have to go really down this list to get into something that's very serious and growing a lot Jupiter is of course a benefiting from all of this mem coin trading but Jupiter is pretty much the casino right it takes the fees because of all that gambling you don't have to bet on black or on red you don't have to bet on the right number you're simply just owning a lot of the meme hype so that's what Jupiter is all about it's about trading activity it's about adoption of Solana it's not about figuring out what the exact right mem coin will be it's simply just a bet on the mem coin frenzy to continue and maybe at some point it won't even be mem coins anymore and something else more serious might be traded then again I think Jupiter can potentially also profit from that the technology seems to be sound a lot of adoption is happening if it's your first time here if you to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much

so it seems like there's almost a 2X from here to get back to Old Heights should we wait well what a lot of people do not realize is that we've actually already seen an alltime high what we've got over here in blue is the market cap of Solana so yes the price did not hit an all-time high but the market kept it and that's because of token inflation as in there's way more Solana tokens floating today then back in 2021 now the big question is is there still upside potential how much adoption do we currently see how much usage do we currently see what's Solana's valuation relative to the rest of the crypto space let's have a look at potential ups and downsides so over here we've got the total value locked of different blockchains so that's on the right column of course ethereum is leading the pack with 45 billion Solana is at number three Tron by the way at number two but a lot of that value is very likely artificial feel free to check out the Tron videos on this channel but what's actually interesting is to see the correlation across crypto right so when there's money flowing out when people are getting risk off then you're getting destroyed pretty much on any metric and Solana did have a very nice ride since December of 2022 so what we've got over here is the Solana dominance how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap is in so and this went from half a perent all all the way to more than 3% but again have a look at this over the very long term how much upside do we still have compared to the potential downside it appears that just from this chart the air might be getting thin now here's a very similar chart this is Solana relative to ethereum so the Solana price divided by the ethereum price again we have seen all-time highs just recently but in case we enter a bare Market which of course is no certainty but just in case there is a real chance that Solana gets crushed yet again I mean just have a look at the magnitude of the swings this is the total value locked off Solana over time this used to be at 65 million so tokens but then went down all the way to 10 million now if this wasn't already bad enough the Solana price during the time also went down so when we look at the total value locked measured in us that went from 10 billion all the way to 210 million so that's 2% of the total value locked a value distraction of 98% within a single year and yes this did change recently but the question is for how long can this total value locked stay so high because here is how defi works there's basically two kinds of players there's the people that actively swap they want to get on on the newest meme coin that want to make money as meme coins rise and there are the people that simply allocate Capital that want to earn money with the swapping fees so if you deploy your Capital to a decentralized exchange you deploy your Capital to a liquidity pool and then a lot of people swap within that liquidity pool when there's a lot of trading volume then the people that deployed the capital get a lot of return if there's not a lot of swapping going on then also those Capital providers are likely going to withdraw their capital and here's the thing have a look at the following two charts on the left side we see the decentralized exchange trading volume on Solana each and every week and this peaked in July of this year so that's over here on this chart when also Solana's dominance peaked and it's since then declining quite rapidly what we see on the right side is the liquidity that's deployed so the liquidity did not decline as quickly as the trading volume in other words there's more Capital now competing for the same amount of trading fees which thus means that the average return that a liquidity provider gets also went down quite a lot so if the trading volume stays low then very likely the liquidity will follow as well people will withdraw their liquidity because if you now deploy for example to the slurf so pool or you deploy to the bomb so pool or to the dog with Head Pool Etc you get the point you only get an annualized return of somewhere around 6% potentially less if you're not an active Trader right if you simply just want to get returns are you willing to keep half of your money into a meme coin if you only get 6% per enm for that the answer is clearly no because there's also risk involved in all of this right there's the risk of a decentralized exchange getting hacked there's also the risk of impermanent loss when the two assets diverge too much from one another there's all kinds of risks that need to get compensated 6% per enm does not cut it the trading volume might continue to go down the total value locked will go down with it as people withdraw their slur s in their book of meme so Etc from the decentralized exchanges the total value locked will decrease the price of Solana relative to other cryptocurrencies is likely going to come down as well and once the negative momentum started then things can become ugly very quickly right here's the underperformance of so relative to ethereum by 86% and here's the underperformance of so dominance as a part of all of crypto minus 86% and of course measured in US Dollars it goes down even more in case crypto so as a whole also goes down I don't have a crystal ball either I do not know where the price is going I'm simply just acting upon risk versus reward I'm not sure how high the reward right now is given that activity is very low and there is already a lot of capital deployed the risk I believe is pretty high that Capital will continue to flow out and thus depress Solana simply take the information in this video as an additional data point I'm not asking you to sell your Solana but I'm personally I simply stay away if it's

#crypto",H barbarians welcome to the channel my name is Nick for those that are new to the channel hopefully by the end of this video you do become a subscriber over the last couple weeks it has been a very exciting time to be a utility project holder now I am recording this video ahead of time so prices are definitely going to change but as we really look at the space guys let's just be honest here we are in the money-making season of crypto where alt season is here we are witnessing some very serious moves and even as we do look at the top 24hour gainers here harar is sitting pretty over 20 cents at the time that I am recording this um up 333 on the last 30 days up almost 20% on The Daily now this did hit recently about 20.2 cents a little over 20.2 cents as we look at the last year it is taking out those yearly gains just as I assumed it would off of these lows um and if you guys don't believe me and and you're sitting there saying come on Nick you're not always right blah blah blah and I'm not always right just want to make that clear but if you go and look at my previous H bar videos um back towards roughly like the beginning of November even like towards the end of October I said that we are going to break to 20 cents again and it is going to happen fast and now we are literally watching this in real time now the alltime chart shows us flipping crucial levels including of course the summer of 2021 lows even if I look at this on the chart here we're actually flipping those low uh candle bodies which is very significant for H bar to do so this is showing immense amount of strength and I do think that we are starting to see that same pattern print it back here from roughly December and also January where the next candle on this chart is going to be very significant and could very well take us and I know that this is going to sound insane to you guys but could take us to 40 to 50 cents on just the next candle with the next few candles after possibly be a pullback before we actually run up to a Dollar Plus for H bar and yes I do believe that hyera could create a major move like that in a very short amount of time especially considering the fact that you know as we look at the overall space right now it's going absolutely insane now I have been focused on trading volume but the number one thing that I've also been looking at is the market cap for harar the overall market cap for harar has grown significantly in fact it's actually at a new all-time high now I do think that everyone should be focused on this because market cap does matter um in fact it does matter for a lot of these projects that have been creating all-time high market caps because it does show you that it is already flipping the 2021 levels now does this matter to the point where you know we could see price action stifled completely and it won't make a new all-time high um I don't believe so it definitely does show us that you know it is already at an all-time high so it is a little bit harder to move to the upside even though a lot of people will look at just the price chart and say you know we're so early it's going to you know break over this and go to like you $3 this dollar that dollar right um but as we really look at hdea I do think that this one does have um a very high probability of breaking into the top 10 and even as we do look at today's market cap of roughly almost $8 billion the top 10 starts at $18 billion so the overall price here will essentially you know double in value which will take us to actually 40 CS now once we do get into the top 10 I don't think that we stop there in fact I actually do think that we continue even higher and you also have to remember that as all season continues to heat up the top 10 does grow significantly in value even if we go and look at the um historical snapshots and we go all the way back here you know to 2021 for an example and we go to like the middle we'll just go to like April 25th you know the top 10 here was about 15 billion and I just want to show you guys how fast it's changed so the next week already at8 $18 billion the next week after that $26 billion almost and this continued right now as we go and we you know Skip ahead a little bit all the way into roughly like September because that's when you know some of the bigger moves of the cycle actually started for a lot of the top 10 projects we can see we can see here um top 10 almost $30 billion 29 billion 29.4 billion and then this is where you know most of the market was starting to kind of cool off a bit but we still are sitting at about roughly $30 billion for the top 10 31 billion 32.5 billion 36 almost 37 billion and this is basically where the market tops out but that's why I say like the top 10 does grow significantly in overall market cap value and even right now as we really kind of look at the top 10 I do think concering the fact that there's a lot of projects here that are already at 37.6 billion 40 billion almost 62 a.2 billion 94.9 billion 10 almost 10 billion 112 billion um I do think that the top 10 will most likely probably see around like 50 to about 75 billion um so as we are really looking at that and we're thinking about you know harar you know harar could essentially uh get to the point of having a market cap in the high 50 billion plus region and that is going to be very significant for the overall price action for hadera now let's actually talk about a few things and let's actually address what's going on for hbar right now so I did put out a post over on X and I said over 1.4 million harar being traded in the last minute looks like we are seeing a big Spotlight put on harar now I kept worrying everyone about what hadera is becoming and now almost no one can ignore it this is just the beginning phase of a much larger expansion I hope you are all prepared and yes technically speaking if we go back over here to dominance and we actually look at Bitcoin dominance versus ethereum and others others are starting to break to the upside and I do believe that this is where we start to see a very large shift in the overall Market we are in the beginning phases of alt season and yes this does signal that harar and a lot of other old coins are about to go on a massive move to the upside just like every single old season prior but also if we go over here to Fiat leak we can see that there is still over 1 million plus h bar being traded in the past minute and it is also showing us that there is a very significant demand for hyera as well which we did expect this to happen anyways because as we really think about hyera and what's been happening over the last year adoption has been quickly growing and the overall moves that the hadera team have been making have been nothing but short of significant so as we really think about what's going on here for hyera I think that people are starting to wake up to how big this is going to be and how large the ecosystem also is now I also want to take you guys over here to Sasha swap because we just saw a very big highlight around the defi ecosystem for hadera so let's dive on in as 20125 approaches we want to share something significant Sasha swap has delivered on its initial Vision what began as an ambitious project to bring defi to hyera has evolved into the Network's Cornerstone protocol consistently ranking among the top 30 dexes globally by liquidity but this is just the beginning in the coming weeks we will unveil our multi-year round map or uh multi-year uh road map for what we're calling the Renaissance of sasas swap this isn't about incremental improvements or feature additions this is about fundamental expansion scaling Sasha swap several times over and imagining what's possible for defi on hadera we've proven that we can build essential infrastructure power price liquidity and volume data for every HTS token on the network process more daily trades than some Regional exchanges serve as the backbone for the entire ecosystem powering everything from wallet Integrations to Oracle feeds now it's time to scale this Foundation into something unprecedented our new road map will outline our vision for the next phase of growth one where we transform from hadera's leading D5 protocol into a Cornerstone of digital Market infrastructure more details coming in early 2025 the next chapter begins and this is a very exciting time to be an H bar holder because the entire ecosystem from defi to tokenization and Beyond is all scaling significantly and I could not be happier to see the hadera ecosystem seeing such tremendous growth seeing a lot more eyes on the project as well and I do think that this is like I said just the beginning now a lot of people say that I'm crazy for thinking that hidea will break into the top 10 but let's actually address why I believe so okay number one since going all the way back to 2021 the number one discussion that I have been having when it comes to a lot of these nextg tokens and Technology players like Cera is the fact that they are usurping demand from ethereum from Bitcoin and from other chains as well and over here we have actually proof of this why did Diamond standard migrate from ethereum to hyera for realworld assets check this out how exactly do you use herera our initial offering was on ethereum and it worked well till the extremely high and unpredictable gas prices made it unviable for us as a business to run on so we considered other blockchains and we you know we finally decided on her era you know the key characteristics that helped us was obviously you know we believe in the governance model we are an Institutional product so the cons the U Council based governance model really helps us the security the reliability and and most importantly the low and predictable gas prices added to that was the you know the addition of the the token service which was you know for us it's like a hand in glove right that's exactly what we needed something we didn't need to build on our own uh something that a platform provided the way we work on herera is we're quite an extensive ecosystem we rely heavily on the herera token service and the smart contract Service we also use the consensus service for key audit events we are a regulated entity and it really helps us to create an audit log you know on chain our physical coins and bars are represented as non-f fungible tokens using HTS now what we're launching now is a fungible token called bit carbon which is a fraction of an asset token you also have a peer-to-peer Marketplace think of it as a centralized limit order book which allows our participants to transact amongst themselves we currently use usdc as the base currency but that has been live for the last eight months and and doing pretty well and when we're really kind of thinking about ethereum and even Bitcoin a lot of people will continue to say oh they're going to stick around they're still going to be you know as big as they are today there is absolutely zero doubt in my mind mind that these projects like ethereum like Bitcoin will be phased out I don't care what anyone says go back in time and look at any early on major Revolution to you know Tech to any sort of you know significant change just take for an example social media okay Myspace seemed like it was never going to end Myspace was going to be the big hit the number one social media platform ever it was never going to die down all of a sudden Facebook comes around boom replaces it when we think about technology over time there has been many technology players out there and you know innovations that felt as if they were going to be around for the next 100 plus years and all of a sudden they get phased out they get replaced something else better comes around I have stay on on this channel many times over and I will continue to stand by it Bitcoin and ethereum in five 10 years Max could happen sooner as well will be phased out by some of these other very large very efficient players in the space that continue to grow significantly okay and again hadera is one that I've always focused on now we bit will Bitcoin and ethereum still be around will they still be you know in the space yeah sure but as we look at the top 10 it is going to change significantly we are going to see you know ethereum dethroned we are going to see Bitcoin dethroned it just makes sense to me now a lot of people will scold me and say no way it's never going to happen but just remember you know in recent times people said the same exact thing about the these other major Innovations and they were quickly phased out so with that being said I hope that you guys enjoyed this video If you guys definitely

#nos #crypto","Nosa is on a massive rally it's up 40% today it more than doubled this week now let's have a look at what's behind this let's look at onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's try to figure out how much longer this really could last and whether or not makes sense to buy still so we currently at $42 and yes when we zoom in and just look at the last week the price development is phenomenal things haven't always been that Rosy though we went from more than $7 all the way down to $13 5 a drop of more than 80% but I've published several videos on nosan and initially not a lot of people were interested the video underperformed your regular video so the average video is here indicated in Gray it then picked up as the price picked up because that video was published when we still at $11.65 again now we are at $46 so if you want to be early next time feel free to subscribe I try to be early on this channel and I publish videos regularly now Nosa is riding the hype of artificial intelligence and of GPU Computing and it's directly competing with projects like render but the issue is we can't get any Edge from information like this right we want to trade crypto because we want to use information most people don't have everybody has the information on this website this is not how we can figure out whether or not the price is currently high or low so one interesting thing to look at is usage or adoption do we see a lot of growth the answer is growth seems to be happening in waves and currently we are not going up so somehow the price is decoupling from the number of completed jobs on Nosa and so who's buying here who's selling here let's see if the numbers align whether or not there is manipulation so on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 58,000 followers on the Solana based token we've got 42,000 holders so a similar order of magnitude and trading indeed happens mainly decentralized on Solana so the main exchanges for NOS are r Orca both decentralized exchanges running directly on the Solana blockchain the tokens also available on gate.io and Mexi now it's very good that most of trading volume happens on chain because this tells us that price Discovery happens on chain so we can see who's actually buying who's selling is this a few large players that are simply buying up all of NOS or is there a lot of new people jumping onto the project let's dive into the onine analytics something I'm doing for pretty much any video on this channel on the left side we see the number of firsttime traders in the last month on the right side we see the number of transactions in the last month and there has been a massive search of new wallets getting into NOS starting from the 24th of October and so this is the 24th of October since the 25th we've come up another 50% or so so I very much like to look at that metric I also like to compare this to the number of recurring Traders when we see days where the number of firsttime Traders is Lar larger than the number of recurring Traders this is very very positive because that tells us a story of a growing investor base right if a price for an asset should grow over the long term we want to have more and more people interested in the token or holding the token we don't just want to have the Wales pushing in all their capital A price rally that's supported by a lot of new investors is more solid now we can ignore the latest data point because the 27th of October hasn't yet finished and it's normal that at the beginning of the day the number first Traders tends to be lower and that's simply because at this time there isn't a lot of trading volume so it's mainly automated trading or trading Bots that are active at this time since the number of token transactions is already at an all-time high I expect that the number of first-time Traders today will likely also be very high again now it's also interesting to look at how the trading volume is developing both in terms of US dollars but also relatively speaking so we've got the trading volume split up in different categories small retail is well s that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and we can of course see how the interest comes in waves and how we are currently starting another wave we can also see that over time large and medium retail tends to take over more and more of trading volume now trading volume is one thing the issue is that large whales might be buying and selling and might use Arbitrage Etc what's really important is how many holders are there and again we've got the split up over here on the left side is retail on the right side is the Wales so this goes from $1,000 minimum holding to $10,000 to $100,000 and the Dynamics we see here are very typical we see them across many alt coins we see that retail tends to Simply Buy and Hold and not necessarily take profit even as the price increases we see this to a lesser degree for medium-sized holders so we see already a few people taking profit recently and we see this even more anounced for the Wales the Wales tend to take profit the earliest they tend to sell the earliest now they are accumulating again since April of this year so they bought in at around $3 and the dollar cost averaged all the way down and they might offload at some point when the price Rises maybe close to alltime Highs but at the moment they're still holding at the moment everything seems still healthy it looks like especially medium-sized retail so the wallets between ,000 and $10,000 they tend to buy most of Nosa they tend to expand the number of unique holders in that category is growing very quickly so this went in the last month from roughly 133% to 19% while small retail went from 84% down to 76% in other words the smart money seems to be buying I like to look at this in the following way the larger a wallet is the more skill that wallet potentially has right because trading is both a game of luck and skill the more we trade and the more skill we have the more we should accumulate Capital thus the larger wallets tend to make the better calls and the larger wallets tend to buy that's good now I couldn't find that number but maybe you've got that number I'm looking for the percent of Nana staked over time is this growing is this flat is this going down because this gives us a hint of when potentially more Supply might hit the market unstaking is always a potential danger so having a lot of staked tokens is not necessarily always good if that's not growing currently we've got 30 million noos Stak or 123 Million worth of NOS that's quite a lot for a project with a market cap of 200 million and when we look on chain at the liquidity on Solana we've only got 2.6 Million worth now half of that is usdc the other half is NOS and yes there are also other liquidity pools but they don't really matter that much they don't really change the picture if there's only 1.3 maybe 1.5 million of usdc that's currently traded against Nosa then this unlock over here worries me this is a Staker that will get their Nosa their 1.2 million NOS unlock in 14 days so that's roughly $5 million worth of NOS now I don't know if this whale is going to sell but the whale definitely has the power to potentially crash the price right now the party is still on the music is still playing but it's definitely important to look very closely at what's going to happen in 14 days maybe to potentially at least shortterm reduce some exposure because there's definitely an increased risk of a potential sale now I always like to look at tokenomics I always want to know how many tokens go to early investors how many tokens go to the team how many tokens get spent for marketing Etc I want to know the token dilution because if the supply increases faster than the demand then the price will of course go down now the nice thing about Nosa is that the tokenomics have improved massively we had a lot of token unlocks in the past the supply more than 4X but now the growth is much much more gradual we want to see as little Supply expansion as possible now as said I publish videos on Nosa regularly here and it's not just on Nosa it's on many different altcoins and I try to be as data driven as possible I try to be as objective as possible if you don't want to miss the next videos feel free to subscribe now there's one more thing I believe that crypto is all about having an edge it's all about being able to buy when most people aren't yet buying when the influencers and when the top Traders are buying secretly and so have a look at this this is some free Alpha shared for you guys influencer Alex Becker is currently buying a lot of the stfx tokens he's dollar cost averaging in with $2,500 at a time sometimes also 5,000 and this matters because Alex Becker has 1.4 million subscribers if he's talking about a token the token is likely going to appreciate very very quickly and so here we go the price is already up by by 47% it's probably going to continue to rise now how do we know that he's buying we know it because we track his wallets there are several wallets that we are tracking some of Alex Becker's wallets are very welln but a lot of wallets that we have are not that welln we've got 12 of his wallets of 436 wallets in total that we track and whenever those wallets buy or sell we get an alert this is all part of Premium so the link is down below it's the bitcoin.com there's an entire course on wallet tracking so we've got eight videos just dedicated on how to find wallets how to track them and how to then afterwards interpret the signals so that's over here that's the eight videos there's also more than 100 videos on other topics all crypto related all about portfolio management and finding Alpha Etc feel free to check it out because again in order to make money long term we need to be better informed than others and we try to help each other as well in the group so we've got a community where we discuss various alt coins in individual TS there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% looking forward to seeing you on premium or looking forward to seeing you in the

things are not what they seem and with not coin that's exactly the case the price is going up fairly quickly the question is why is that the case let's have a look at some data most people are not considering because here's the official version most people think that not coin the largest meme coin on the ton network is going up because ton sees a lot of adoption but when we actually dive deep into the data I'm not sure if this is all organic So currently we are at 1.2 C we are up 26% today but here's the impressive part not coin more than doubled in this week alone here's the website which is actually quite entertaining probably nothing but once you interact with this there's actually quite some nice animations so you're clicking your way around mining not coin and so this is definitely a meme coin that got deployed with quite a bit of effort here's the white paper also pretty creative as in there's nothing in here but let's get a bit more serious this here is the reason why people believe meme coins on the ton Network should be accelerating what we've got over here is the total value locked measured in US Dollars on the ton blockchain we are currently at above 300 million this is going up quite steeply since February of this year and this increase is not just because ton itself the ton coin itself went up because while this is the total value locked measured in US Dollars this is is the same chart measured in ton coin also quite a bit of adoption looks pretty healthy and so this is usually how this goes first Bitcoin goes up then ethereum goes up then all the layer twos go up so all of the competing blockchains and then the assets on those blockchains go up and so ton coin itself went up by more than 3.5x in the last year it's currently at $650 and we talked about ton coin on this channel when it was still at $5 so just 2 months ago so if you want to be early next time maybe consider following channels like this I try to be early I try to publish videos regularly as well now here's the data on ton chain. org so this is the block Explorer of the ton blockchain and at first glance this looks promising the number of addresses tends to be increasing but this by the way it's not active addresses simply just accumulative addresses so any chart will go up what we've got over here is the Stak ton unfortunately this is not going up if there were more and more ton coins that are being staked then this would depress the circulating Supply the actively trade Supply potentially pushing up the price but unfortunately we don't see that this graph is pretty much stable and so yes there are quite a few applications on the blockchain but when we look at the details on defi Lama we can see that a lot of the price appreciation is simply just because of ton coin going up so let's have a look at ton stakers the largest of the protocols this is the total value locked change measured in ton in the last two months there is a bit of an increase but it's not massive and so here here in the background this page is the one with the data that opened my eyes around not coin so the meme coin on the ton blockchain the coin that more than doubled in the last week what about on this page is so interesting just have a look at the transactions here have a look at the frequency of transactions there isn't much happening actually maybe a transfer every few hours that's about it there isn't much directly on chain with not coin very few transactions back and forth but the price itself is moving very actively all the time how is that possible I believe the answer is over here this is the trading volume of NCoin most trading volume happens on binance there's also some trading volume on bybit and on okx there isn't any trading volume directly on the ton blockchain so that's a spot market and here we've got the Perpetual Futures Market almost 200% of the market cap got traded on the lever Perpetual Futures derivatives Market on binance 2. $2 billion in the last 24 hours and just add up all of those different perps this is all just a game across the centralized exchanges while nothing is happening on chain I believe this is manipulation by the big guys when the price is going up this creates attention and when there's enough attention when enough retail people bought into the token then the token can crash down again when on top of that we also see a lot of trading in the Perpetual Futures and maybe a lot of retain investors bet on falling prices because they don't believe in the rally then a short squeeze can happen right then more of the token can get bought up and the force liquidations generate more fees for the centralized exchanges have a look at year Finance we had seen the exact same thing in year Finance feel free to check out the video of un Finance on this channel I made a video just at the tippy top of this squeeze and what happened subsequently a massive dump from 14k all the way to 7K in just a matter of a few weeks have a look at ygg the exact same thing binance holds a lot and also engages In Perpetual Futures the price tripled to then come down again that happened in August of last year check out the ydg video recently we' have seen something very similar again from $1.7 all the way down to $0.7 and so the big question is how far are we with that manipulation do we see another squeeze or will we simply just trickle down again I believe the best here is to be very well prepared for a potential dump at some point not coin is not an asset that you want to buy and hold over the next year it's an asset to be actively traded and you do have the centralized exchanges against you so if you're betting on this I personally don't but if you're betting on this I think the best approach is to use trailing stop losses as in when the price still rises you want to adjust your stop loss and then in case the dumpage happens you want to exit very very quickly because at some point I do believe the price will come down again will it come down today will it come down tomorrow I don't know I only see that there is currently manipulation and manipulation will not last forever if it's your first time here feel free

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #chaingpt #cgpt #crypto","I promise you this video has data on chain gbt that you have not seen anywhere else and that you will not see anywhere else we are going to look at toomics we're going to look at onchain data we're going to look at who's buying and who's selling because some pretty smart heavyweights seem to be buying here now the price of chain GPT hasn't actually done much in the last month and so I do not expect this video to get a lot of views I make this video anyways simply so that I can point towards that in 2 3 4 5 months from now chain GPT has been rallying and crashing and now is back to consolidation now this doesn't look like an alltime high but actually we are at an all-time high not in the price but in the market cap what does that mean it means that now there's way more Capital Bound in chain GPT and the price simply didn't hit alltime highs because there's now more tokens floating around the number of circulating chain GPT tokens has increased so far 38% of the total Supply is Circ calculating and this is how the increase looks over time now who is getting all of those tokens is this a fair launch is this all going to the stakers there is some that goes to the stakers but most of it is simply just early investors here's the staking program and you get somewhere between Z and 8% you can get 44% but this is simply liquidity staking so you are subject to impermanent loss here you're not getting money just for staking you're getting money because of the trading fees that occur against this chy versus BD liquidity pool if you couldn't follow what I just said then maybe you have to look a bit deeper into defi it's a very standard decentralized Finance mechanism that's independent of chain GPT now here's something I like even though the distribution isn't pretty for the general public and even though the price can crash as we've seen in the past the project is very transparent about the distribution we can see that 9% of tokens go to marketing another 9% to the Dow 9% to the team for 4% to the development it's interesting that the development is not part of the team there's only 9% to the public and almost 16% in private funding rounds key opinion leaders so influencers get almost as much as the public so if you see a lot of crypto YouTubers Shilling this project here you know why they are getting paid handsomely I never take any money from any project the only way how I monetize my YouTube is with the premium membership link is down below I'll talk about this more later in the video now on supply. chain gp.org we've even got a life circulating Supply tracker we can see that from the total 383 million that are currently circulating 336 million are just for team Finance vesting so this is a token in the strong strong hands of the people running the show this is pretty much the exact opposite toomics of something like kaspa that was completely fairly launched where everybody got their share through mining chain gbt works very differently chain gbt puts a lot of money on marketing hoping to increase the investor size fast enough that the dilution doesn't take over so you might have already noticed that I'm not the guy that simply just runs you through the website and sells you the marketing Jazz I try to look at the data that most people aren't looking at I try to be as objective as possible and so let's have a look at one of those data points that most people don't look at let's have a look at the GitHub repository so this is the place where program submit their code changes so we can see how much is the project just in terms of raw programmer activity developing and this is not too great a last update on the documentation on January 4th another update in December of last year I've seen more active repositories to be completely honest I've also toyed around a little bit with their tools on the website they don't all work at least for me when I tried this on Google Chrome so for example here we click on change gbt the chatbot which is for free we get this is here on the right I click on General assistant but I can't enter any message here this seems to be dead there's two versions of the token one of them being on ethereum that token has 2,400 holders and the main token on the binance smart chain with 34,000 holders let's have a look at data that other YouTubers cannot look at because they don't have access to this tool I've developed this tool I like to segregate what is retail doing versus what are the whales doing who's buying who's selling who's imp impacting the price and for change GT we have to do this for both tokens right for ethereum and for the binance smart chain here's the token on ethereum and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 chain GPT tokens so at the current price that's roughly $193 that's small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail it's a 10x from the left chart so this is now roughly $2,000 minimum holding on the right side we've got roughly $20,000 worth of holding so longterm all wallet cohort tend to be accumulating this chart starts in June of 2023 here's the same for the last month only mainly accumulation on all fronts let's have a look at the main token the binance smart chain also very nice long-term accumulation by all wallet cohorts in the last 30 days that accumulation isn't that clear anymore especially the number of largest whales went down somewhat and so who was driving the plus 11% in the last month it was not the Wales it was the regular retail dude that's buying in and they bought in luckily fast enough that the massive token dilution so far couldn't take over but we have to keep growing at this rate now why am I even looking at this token the reason why I look at this is because I found a very successful influencer buying in this heavily so it's not an influencer that got the token just sent to their wallet for promoting it it's an influencer that actually made a swap and so let's have a look at premium we are tracking various influencers and among them crypto gains crypto gains bought $57,000 worth of chain GPT just yesterday that was at 19 so he might be in slight profit now so let's have a look I would not be surprised to see crypto Gaines make a video on chain GPT soon it maybe he can even move the price a little because currently the market cap is only 74 million it's not that much if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I probably regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and of course do not forget to join premium we are tracking influencers super super closely we buy before the general

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this video does not constitute financial advice. This video is for entertainment purposes only. Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #bitcoin #btc #crypto",Jupiter is an outlier not just because of its massive price run also because it's a very distinct asset on the Solana chain there's a lot of meem coins on Solana not so much Defi and so we've got a lot of data around Jupiter we can look on chain at a lot of metrics we can look at adoption we can look at trading volume we can look at buyers and sellers we can actually figure out where potentially the price might go and so here's the rally I'm talking about we are up 28% today alone we are up almost 70% in this week we increased by by 140% almost this month but things didn't always look that positive for Jupiter where did this initial decline come from now the first suspect is always an expanding Supply right if more and more tokens hit the market because there's maybe vesting unlocks then of course this could depress the price and what we see here on coin market cap is pretty worrying only 13.5% of all of Jupiter token are circulating but this is not the entire story have a look at this this is Cryptor rank. and it shows us the allocation of the Jupiter tokens we've got all kinds of allocations and only 12.5% are unlocked but there's a slight mismatch here with coin market cap that says 13.5% are circulating but what are those unlocks and how will the supply expand here is token. unlocks do app and this shows us that actually the jup token did not expand in Supply so far we are constant at 1.35 billion tokens but there is this massive allocation on a cold multisig wallet for the team and for the community and that might become available in February of next year there's probably more details to it potential Milestones that have to be reached so far the supply expansion is not a problem if you're trading somewhat shortterm and don't look too far out in the future now here's something very nice about Jupiter we see here the total value locked since the swap exchange launched and this is constantly increasing very nice this is the US dollar chart though and of course some of that increase is due to the Solana price going up so here's the same chart denominated in s so tokens and here the growth pretty much stalled in the last 3 weeks or so this is again total value lock this is not Usage Now there's all kinds of different products you can do limit orders on Solana you can trate Perpetual Futures with Jupiter let's try to get an idea in what direction the demand for the token and for the platform could develop this is onchain data this is a number of Jupiter total users over time unfortunately this is accumulating so we don't really see how fast the growth is if the growth is accelerating here's a different chart this shows us the daily active users this shows the last month and we had a peak roughly one week ago since then this is unfortunately going down here's the number of swaps pretty much the same development but here's an interesting metric there's another kind of swaps that is actually going up this is spot plus Perpetual Futures Trading this is continuing to grow so it looks like some Jupiter users are migrating over from spot trading to Perpetual Futures Trading so that's the new product that they launched right it's still in beta but even though it's in beta the assets under management for the perss continues to grow very steadily very nicely and so yes there is real demand there is real usage of the platform and this might at least partially explain a lot of the price value now I say a lot and not all and that's because of the following directly on chain Jupiter actually isn't that large anymore when you order by the liquidity pool size then Jupiter is at rank number 34 and all kinds of other random tokens are above that and this is underpinned by this chart this is a tool that I've developed myself it's available for the premium members it shows us on an hourly basis in the last week the number of firsttime traders in the jup token versus recurring Traders and we had a search of firsttime Traders on the 10th of March but the price didn't really move much on the 10th of March so what we're seeing here is after the search of firsttime Traders it was mainly recurring Traders when there are no Central exchanges involved then usually there's a very strong connection between the number of new people that get into a token versus it's future price development because of course an expanding investor base tends to mean more money flows into this tends to mean higher prices so seeing the number of first-time Traders not being very high while the price is suddenly shooting up it's definitely a sign that the centralized exchanges are doing something here and lo and behold when we look at the markets and the trading volume this is now dominated by binance binance has 30 35% of trading volume okx 10% buy bit 9 etc etc it's not anymore the radiums and oras of this world it's not anymore the decentralized exchanges and the onchain activity that moves the Jupiter price and so since we don't have the data right all those centralized exchanges are basically black boxes it's much harder to figure out what's the potential upside here we can of course look at relative valuations so this is now the Jupiter price relative to the Solana price and there we are relatively close to the all-time high from bottom to the current price we went up by 56% this is a chart that starts at the end of January but here's something important I believe that Jupiter is pretty unique in its value proposition a lot of the tokens on Solana right now are simply just memec coin trading people get on the memec coin train and I'm not sure if all investors want to gamble with memecoins some people want to simply just invest in a growing def5 protocol with good reason this is the largest tokens on the Solana chain ordered by liquidity it's all meme book of meme dog with head pop cat Myro smok Pang py Sol geob Balden Etc it's all just Meme and we have to go really down this list to get into something that's very serious and growing a lot Jupiter is of course a benefiting from all of this mem coin trading but Jupiter is pretty much the casino right it takes the fees because of all that gambling you don't have to bet on black or on red you don't have to bet on the right number you're simply just owning a lot of the meme hype so that's what Jupiter is all about it's about trading activity it's about adoption of Solana it's not about figuring out what the exact right mem coin will be it's simply just a bet on the mem coin frenzy to continue and maybe at some point it won't even be mem coins anymore and something else more serious might be traded then again I think Jupiter can potentially also profit from that the technology seems to be sound a lot of adoption is happening if it's your first time here if you to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much

last 24 hours the answer is a listing on coinbase here's announcement on the Twitter channel it's becoming the fourth base token to be listed on coinbase and so now trading is likely going to move gradually from the Unis swaps of this world to centralized trading we do already have buybit okx gate.io and htx involved in trading but Unis swap was leading the PC this might now changed with the coinbase listing now the dent token is one of the largest tokens on the base chain when we order all trending tokens in the last 24 hours by that trading volume we've got Deen directly behind coinbase rep BTC there's a liquidity pool against Unis Swap and there are two liquidity pools against Aerodrome now deun has launched its own chain and initially there was quite a lot of hype but over time things died down we have now only $400,000 worth of trading volume on the D chain that being said we now finally have wrapped ethereum on the Chain as well this is not how the chain launched initially every single token had to be swapped against Deen in other words if the Deen token itself went down then of course your altcoin on the dent chain also went down and so this is how that worked you could simply bridge over your tokens with the DM Bridge unfortunately though withdrawing takes 7 days so you can bridge over directly but you need to wait 7 days to get your money out again now the Deen chain stays true to its name when we look at the largest of the alt coins on the Deen chain and we look at the volatility it's truly degenerate check this out this is the token of Dent swap the largest decentralized exchange on the dent chain and that went down from top to bottom by 99.6% and had you bought just 1 month ago you'd now be up by 1,300% now let's move away from the dun chain itself because there's not too much action let's actually look at the dun token is there potential upside from here we're going to look at onchain metrics most people do not have access to a more obvious statistic though is the number of holders we have more than 7,777 holders not a lot of those holders though have significant quantities because dun does get air drops regularly what we see on the left side is the number of wallets that have at least 100,000 D token so at the current price that's $812 there's only 6,000 such wallets so less than 1% of all of holders have $800 worth of the token the vast vast majority of holders are only in it with play money now in the middle we've got the mediumsized holders that's a minimum holding of a million tokens so $88,000 worth of the token on the right we've got a minimum holding of $8,000 worth of the token so on the right that's what I'd consider Wales on the left that's what I'd consider retail now here's something interesting we have seen a lot of retail demand up until the beginning of May of this year the number of holders grew very very rapidly and then it suddenly turned around now have a look at the price chart during this time here is the beginning of May so even though a lot of new people entered the token the price still went down from 56 cents all the way to 16 cents so a drop of more than 60 70% how is it possible when so many new investors get into the token that the price collapses that much we've seen accumulation across the board only some whales sold already in March of this year I think the explanation for that price drop is again toomics because a lot of Deen tokens get regularly air dropped and we are currently in airdrop number two there will be another airdrop number three the largest of the airdrops and so the fully diluted market cap is roughly three times of the current market cap so the number of circulating tokens will almost 3x still this needs to go to 1 million or March buyers now will make millions this is how you get the clicks on YouTube but this is not how you beat the market to beat the market in crypto you need to be better informed than the rest you need to be better skilled than the rest you need to do better blockchain analytics you need to track other people's wallets and know what is the Smart money doing it's the boring educational content that form skill that doesn't perform so well on YouTube though that's why I created the premium membership feel free to check it out we are tracking influencer wallets to find out what they are buying before promoting this on YouTube we've got a lot of tutorials to help with onchain analytics to help with wallet Discovery and of course there are also plenty of chats where we help each other and also one-on-one conversations with me so I'm messaging every premium member one-on-one directly once you're joining you will get a message from me and you have the opportunity to directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the Bitcoin tr.com link is down below now let's have a look at what happened in the last month of course we've got this massive Spike because of the coinbase listing but there's also something else that's not worthy see how the price tended to already appreciate before that listing and here we've got again the same kind of holder charts this time though only for the last month so this is now ourly ticks and we can see how retail investors continue to sell mediumsized retail also continue to sell and the whales in aggregate did not necessarily buy up until the listing of course so the price tended to creep up while the number of holders tended to rather go down call me a conspiracy theorist but I believe some insiders might have known beforehand that Deen gets listed on coinbase maybe coinbase itself or maybe some Affiliated parties bought it secretly in the background and those purchases stabilized the price while the majority of people gave up on the token and some of those people might now take profit right right now here's the thing not all dun tokens are liquid on chain this 75% increase seems like millions and millions of dollars went into the token because it increased the fully diluted market cap by more than 100 million this doesn't mean that $100 million went into the token on chain when we add up those different liquidity pools we maybe have $5 to6 million worth of deun but that's again just one side of the liquidity pool right the other side is rep ethereum so maybe we only have 3 million that's actually traded on chain and there are some wallets that have so many dun tokens that they could instantly completely crash the price we can't find those holders directly on the base scan Explorer because unfortunately this feature doesn't work here anymore but I did build a little tool in June to still show us the largest holders and so let's look at number one and let's look at number 10 the largest wallet has $132 Million worth of deun the 10th largest wallet has almost $3 million worth of Deen and note when we add all of this together there's only $3 million worth of Deen that's traded on chain so all of those wallets single-handedly could completely crush the price so really what's going on with the price action of ding cannot be explained organically we have seen massive manipulation in the past with 70% drops while the number of holders grew very very quickly and we've seen a stabilization of the price while the numbers of holders tended to rather go down again because of insider trading so it's really hard to estimate where the price will go right on chain metrics don't really work here it seems like a few people have all the power over the token and they move it in the direction of their liking I personally stay away from the token even though it might further rise from here I simply don't feel comfortable with the manipulation of the price I think it's better to get into tokens with less concentrated ownership if it's the first time here feele to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow in case you've got telegram then

things are not what they seem and with not coin that's exactly the case the price is going up fairly quickly the question is why is that the case let's have a look at some data most people are not considering because here's the official version most people think that not coin the largest meme coin on the ton network is going up because ton sees a lot of adoption but when we actually dive deep into the data I'm not sure if this is all organic So currently we are at 1.2 C we are up 26% today but here's the impressive part not coin more than doubled in this week alone here's the website which is actually quite entertaining probably nothing but once you interact with this there's actually quite some nice animations so you're clicking your way around mining not coin and so this is definitely a meme coin that got deployed with quite a bit of effort here's the white paper also pretty creative as in there's nothing in here but let's get a bit more serious this here is the reason why people believe meme coins on the ton Network should be accelerating what we've got over here is the total value locked measured in US Dollars on the ton blockchain we are currently at above 300 million this is going up quite steeply since February of this year and this increase is not just because ton itself the ton coin itself went up because while this is the total value locked measured in US Dollars this is is the same chart measured in ton coin also quite a bit of adoption looks pretty healthy and so this is usually how this goes first Bitcoin goes up then ethereum goes up then all the layer twos go up so all of the competing blockchains and then the assets on those blockchains go up and so ton coin itself went up by more than 3.5x in the last year it's currently at $650 and we talked about ton coin on this channel when it was still at $5 so just 2 months ago so if you want to be early next time maybe consider following channels like this I try to be early I try to publish videos regularly as well now here's the data on ton chain. org so this is the block Explorer of the ton blockchain and at first glance this looks promising the number of addresses tends to be increasing but this by the way it's not active addresses simply just accumulative addresses so any chart will go up what we've got over here is the Stak ton unfortunately this is not going up if there were more and more ton coins that are being staked then this would depress the circulating Supply the actively trade Supply potentially pushing up the price but unfortunately we don't see that this graph is pretty much stable and so yes there are quite a few applications on the blockchain but when we look at the details on defi Lama we can see that a lot of the price appreciation is simply just because of ton coin going up so let's have a look at ton stakers the largest of the protocols this is the total value locked change measured in ton in the last two months there is a bit of an increase but it's not massive and so here here in the background this page is the one with the data that opened my eyes around not coin so the meme coin on the ton blockchain the coin that more than doubled in the last week what about on this page is so interesting just have a look at the transactions here have a look at the frequency of transactions there isn't much happening actually maybe a transfer every few hours that's about it there isn't much directly on chain with not coin very few transactions back and forth but the price itself is moving very actively all the time how is that possible I believe the answer is over here this is the trading volume of NCoin most trading volume happens on binance there's also some trading volume on bybit and on okx there isn't any trading volume directly on the ton blockchain so that's a spot market and here we've got the Perpetual Futures Market almost 200% of the market cap got traded on the lever Perpetual Futures derivatives Market on binance 2. $2 billion in the last 24 hours and just add up all of those different perps this is all just a game across the centralized exchanges while nothing is happening on chain I believe this is manipulation by the big guys when the price is going up this creates attention and when there's enough attention when enough retail people bought into the token then the token can crash down again when on top of that we also see a lot of trading in the Perpetual Futures and maybe a lot of retain investors bet on falling prices because they don't believe in the rally then a short squeeze can happen right then more of the token can get bought up and the force liquidations generate more fees for the centralized exchanges have a look at year Finance we had seen the exact same thing in year Finance feel free to check out the video of un Finance on this channel I made a video just at the tippy top of this squeeze and what happened subsequently a massive dump from 14k all the way to 7K in just a matter of a few weeks have a look at ygg the exact same thing binance holds a lot and also engages In Perpetual Futures the price tripled to then come down again that happened in August of last year check out the ydg video recently we' have seen something very similar again from $1.7 all the way down to $0.7 and so the big question is how far are we with that manipulation do we see another squeeze or will we simply just trickle down again I believe the best here is to be very well prepared for a potential dump at some point not coin is not an asset that you want to buy and hold over the next year it's an asset to be actively traded and you do have the centralized exchanges against you so if you're betting on this I personally don't but if you're betting on this I think the best approach is to use trailing stop losses as in when the price still rises you want to adjust your stop loss and then in case the dumpage happens you want to exit very very quickly because at some point I do believe the price will come

look at some onchain analytics let's try to figure out what's currently going on who's buying who's selling here now this is not the first video on Peanut on this channel we first talked about it 9 days ago and that video outperformed the regular video so an average video is here in gray that peanut video is in blue and so that was at a time when the price was still at 11 cents now even with that crash of 28% we are still at $170 we went up by more than 1,500% and so I cover various meme coins regularly on this channel and I try to be early if you don't want to miss the next peanut feel free to subscribe but let's go on with the data what we've got over here is the number of First Time Traders versus recurring Traders per day on Peanut what we've got on the right is the number of transactions per day and of course initially we have seen a nice growing investor base the growth slowed somewhat on the 4th of November and the seventh of November was the first day where the number of recurring Traders outpaced the number of first-time Traders now that was over here and initially we didn't see that much more appreciation but then came the binance listing and subsequent other listings which propelled the price further up another 10x now I always like to look at trading volume and I always like to look at who's driving the trading volume on the left side we see the US dollars that are traded on chain on Solana per day on the right side we see this normalized per day to 100% And we are splitting up the trading volume into different cohorts we look at the whale wallets that's the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token we look at large retail that's up to $100,000 mediumsized retail up to 10,000 and small retail up to $1,000 and clearly we can see our two adoption waves again but what we also Noti is that the whales and large retail tends to make less and less transactions on chain especially medium-sized retail takes over more and more of that trading volume so those are the wallets between $1,000 and $10,000 now with the binance listing a lot of the tokens got moved from the self custody so from The Phantom wallet to binance to the centralized exchange thus we see how the number of holders actually went down quite a bit now we are segregating here again between different wallet cohorts on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 tokens at the current price of peanut that's $1,740 for the chart in the middle we go another 10x so that's now $77,000 worth of the token and on the right sideart yet another 10x so that's $170,000 worth of the token among small retail roughly 1/3 of holders have either sold or sent their tokens to binance among the mediumsized wallets it's roughly half of the holders that have sold or moved to binance and among the Wales it's more than half what can we learn from this it seems like retail isn't selling or isn't sending that much to binance while the whales are very much active I believe those sharts transfer again one very clear learning in crypto the whales tend to buy very early while small retail tends to to buy after a price R has happened it's very important to buy meme coins when the market cap is still small enough that there's sufficient upside potential now how much more upside potential is there for peanut we come to that question in a second but first of all have a look at the selling volume today so of course we are down in the last 24 hours that's not 20% and that's because there's 51% more selling volume than buying volume however check out the number of buyers versus sellers there are way more sellers now than buyers in other words the people that are currently buying they tend to buy with larger amounts even though the price has ried that much and even though a lot of the sellers should have a lot of money to sell and their selling position should be rather large the buyer orders are actually larger it appears as if the big hands are buying and so this is then the evolution of a token that goes through a listing like this that goes through the adoption of a centralized exchange where all the centralized exchanges scoop up the tokens check this out here on the left this shows how much of the token ownership is held by the whale wallets so the wallets that have at least $100,000 worth of the token and this increased gradually over time and now pretty much all of the tokens are just held by the Wales yes there are still a lot of retail investors and a lot of medium-sized investors Etc right the percent of those wallets is still high but what they actually own in reality relative to the total Supply is insignificant now what's the upside here let's simply compare market caps of various meme coins peanut is now at a market cap of 1.6 billion if it was to double it gets close to dog with head if it was to Triple it's rivaling Pepe a 10x would put it above shibba Eno it would make it the second largest of the mem coins that's I believe rather unlikely now don't get me wrong I'm not against mem coin trading but I am looking for the right risk to reward and when we buy a meme coin meme coins can easily crash 50 60 70% if that's the we also want to have the multiple X return upside if a meme coin that we buy can't do another 10 x but others that have similar risk can easily do that because of their smaller market caps why not take those smaller market caps the problem is always how can we find those right tokens I think there's already a pretty good filter because right now the ecosystem that tends to Trend the most is the pump fun ecosystem it's the launch pad of meme coins on Solana check out the performance in the last 7 Days across crypto categories the pump fun ecosystem outperformed everything else we now see the base mem coins starting to catch up as well but still within pump fun peanut is very very large it's almost double the size of the next Contender gold and when we got 10 places down we already at a market cap that's only one tenth of number one so something like Fred could do a 10x something like peanut probably not now how can we buy something like peanut early how can we buy this at a few cents not at a few dollars I think the answer in this lies in wallet tracking so the blockchain is transparent we know what wallet is buying and selling the art is in finding the wallets that matter and so for example here in our alerts Channel we have seen how Crypt banter bought the peanut token for 3 cents Crypt banter is one of the largest crypto channels on YouTube they've got 1.1 million subscribers and we've got 33 of their wallets we found this again through onchain analytics right we tried to figure out what kind of wallets could match Crypt banter we Tred to reconstruct transactions we've also got wallets by Alex Becker he's got 1.48 million subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets and so I really believe in this strategy I think it's way better to buy whatever influencers are buying it's way better to buy whatever successful Traders are buying it's way better to do that than simply just to look at a random list of tokens and buy whatever there's a tutorial course on how to find influencer Wallets on how to track those influencer wallets that we get alerts whenever they buy and sell and how to then also interpret the alerts that we are getting it's all part of Premium of course premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about risk mitigation about portfolio diversification Etc once we've got the trading signals we also need to discuss them of course we need to figure out when to buy when to sell for that we've got dedicated allcoin chats in premium as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money simply just message me within the first s days and I'll refund to you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so do I believe that peanut can recover from this dip yes I think so because the whales continue to buy is it the best risk to reward bet in crypto right now I'm not so sure I think the best rewards lie in the smaller cap altcoins that are currently been bought by the influencers by the top Traders if you got some value this video feel free to subscribe I pr youly would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VWJzEU96mA,"['Solana', 'Pepe', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0VWJzEU96mA/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-15T08:27:30Z

Turbo Review, Turbo Price, Turbo Price Prediction, Turbo longterm, Turbo Tokenomics,   #turbo #memecoin #crypto","crypto is looking incredibly bullish but turbo the turbo meme coin isn't doing that well in the last week what's going on I've made several videos on turbo before let's have a look at the updated onchain metric that most people aren't considering let's try to get an edge in this market now in general the market is expanding right now and ethereum and its layer twos is one of the main winners in this we got the approval for the ethereum ETF so a lot of money will flow into ethereum help in the tokens on Eve of course as well but there's something strange going on I published a video on turbo just 3 days ago and since then the price didn't actually move that much so we were at 0.66 cents now we are at 0.61 cents however the videos performed quite well as in there were way more views than for the average video that was both for the first but also for that second video where does all the attention come from and the price isn't doing much now let's first have a look at the onchain metrics in the last week so on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least $1,000 worth of the turbo token we had quite a lot of purchasing on the 30th and 31st of May then retail rather distributed but still over that week the number of holders grew for retail for mediumsized retail that's not necessarily the case this is now a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the turbo token here again this is how the price developed we had a massive Rush then a subsequent dump and we've got all of that attention while turbo is only at Market rank 239 that's quite surprising but actually turbo isn't as small as it appears to be because when we look at the tokens directly on chain on the ethereum chain and we order those token tokens by the size of their liquidity pools then what we discover is that turbo is actually at Place 18 it's the 18th largest cryptocurrency on ethereum so the 239 ranking in terms of market cap is really quite deceptive now there is a problem with too and I talked about this already in the prior video turbo is one of the largest tokens on chain but it's also held massively by the centralized exchanges 16% is held by okx 15% is held by uphold we've also got massive holding by gate.io by bitet by Maxi and not all of those wallet balances are constantly accumulating right this is rather going sideways here this chart doesn't look that different at least in the last few weeks and have a look at this initially accumulation now distribution so the picture is quite mixed maybe there's some kind of battle between the centralized exchanges going on here this is not just accumulation by retail or by the Wales 37% of trading volume happens on gate iio 30% on okx Etc this is a token dominated by the centralized exchanges now there's a second version of tobo and that's on the Solana chain it has way less liquidity but I do want to point out the onchain statistics we had a lot of activity up until the 28th of May that activity then turned around the 28th of May was by the way over here and so the bet with all of this is that the centralized exchanges will at some point push this again right when there's so much holding of Turbo now and when there's still so much attention on turbo as can be seen with the YouTube statistics then maybe at some point when the trading volume is low enough and when the price has depressed enough we might see another artificial pump again how long can that take maybe around 3 months because check this out this is the long-term turbo chart on a logarithmic scale we had a pump in December of 2023 then another pump in March of 2024 and now the next one in May of this year so maybe in July maybe in August we see another pump but probably we first have to come down with the trading volume and of course there is a correlation between attention trading volume and price as the trading volume goes down the price tends to decline as well and so one potential approach could be to simply just dollar cost average down right one could simply stay away but if you're long-term bullish on turbo and you're okay with the volatility you can simply just buy as we go down and then when nobody is looking when attention is super low that's probably the point in time when the centralized exchanges are going to set up the fireworks again if it's the first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly also on turbo feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow statistics like this or like this can be made with the tools in premium the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com you can plug in

XYZ another update on the protocol 11 hours ago an update even for the documentation 14 hours ago Etc so there is real work being done and constant code changes of course potentially means new projects being launched at some point now here's something I very much like the Yuma team has published a dune dashboard directly on the website there's a link at the top to look at the statistics and the statistics are all 100% transparent because all of this data comes directly from the blockchain so for example here this ever increasing total value lock chart it comes directly from converted blockchain data this is very very transparent the charts tend to go up up into the right so that initial impression that we had that this is maybe manipulation could actually be wrong maybe finally the market is realizing something now I've built a tool that I very often use on this channel this tool looks at what are currently retail investors doing versus what are the whales doing I show this in almost every video on this channel and this is very very useful data because it shows us what the smart money is doing on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 100 Yuma tokens so it's currently $380 roughly in the middle we go one order of magnitude up so that's 1,000 tokens so a bit under $4,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales so this is now 10,000 tokens almost 40K worth of Yuma in the wallet Now isn't that interesting this massive dump over here this happened in February of last year have a look at the Yuma price in February of last year was still at around $7 or so just to then go down all the way to $150 now the whale started accumulating again beginning in August of last year and that was over here right pretty much the bottom let's look at this on a logarithmic scale here we go this is where the whales bought and they're up more than 100% since then and they are still not selling now those are all long-term charts those are daily charts each of those data points is a day but we can also look at the hourly chart just for the last 30 days it's nice that we see an accumulation from all fronts here small retail Med medum siiz retail and Wales everyone is buying here now this is not your typical Shilling channel right if I simply just wanted to sell Yuma to you I want to buy early and then sell this to you pump up the price then I'd finish the video here but I'm not like that I want to show the pros and the cons and here comes a chart that is not pretty this is also a Yuma chart a very long-term Yuma chart this chart starts in September of 2020 and this is not humor in US dollars this is Yuma relative to ethereum so unfortunately had you bought Yuma at the end of 2020 and you held all the way to today including the rally you'd still be down relative to holding ethereum by 96.5% and this trend is very consistent where does all the cell pressure come from I don't know for certain but there might be the following contributor there is token minting happening over time this is not super rapid but the supply definitely is expanding somewhat it grew by 17% or so in those four years it doesn't explain an under performance of 96.5% but it was definitely also not good for the price development now here's the million dooll question that I cannot answer for you does it make sense to buy Yuma potentially for short-term trading right currently momentum is very bullish and all the wallet cohorts are buying longterm buying this over many many years I don't know fundamentally it's very very high hard to disrupt the Oracle Market this is what Yuma is trying to do right Yuma is directly competing with chain link the reason why competition is so stiff is because very often the data that is used for those oracles have a lot of weight to it for example the data of chain link is used to estimate how much is collateral worth for a def5 protocol now if you make a mistake there just a temporary mistake and you overestimate for example how much is your collateral Worth right what's currently the price of Bitcoin and you give a wrong answer then this can put potentially drain the entire funds of a defi protocol of a borrowing Landing platform so data reliability is hyper hyper important and you don't want to toy around with this and so I've got the impression that chain link has pretty much successfully monopolized that market if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram link is down below",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltN1za0cY4,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'JUST', 'UMA', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oltN1za0cY4/hqdefault.jpg,2024-01-19T07:01:35Z

I believe these coins have a higher chance of outperforming bitcoin before the end of the crypto bull run.,at the start of the year I began tracking 11 specific coins while many have already rallied some are still building up for their big move so far only Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high salana jasmi and render have performed well year-to dat with salana even reclaiming its 52- we highs meanwhile cardano and xrp have started pumping and seem poised to continue their upward momentum however Avalanche Gala hadera polka dot and ethereum have yet to show significant progress for this reason I plan to keep accumulating these coins in the coming days stopping only once they recover their 52e highs Avalanche polka dot and hadera are currently trading at roughly 2x below their 52- we highs while Gala lags further behind needing nearly a 3X move to reclaim its 52- we High,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxNpm_Htbs,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Cardano', 'Avalanche', 'Render', 'Gala']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WqxNpm_Htbs/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-15T16:17:18Z

#crypto","everything is going up today except some things are going up more than others KLM or the Kosama token which is a test network of the poker. chain is going up quite a lot now let's have a look at who's buying here who's selling here let's look at some data most people are not considering because I believe this is the fundamentals of making money with trading right we want to have a market Edge we want to use information most people don't use you want to dive deeper than most now let's start with the obvious the price of Kosama is currently at 44 and went up by almost 80% today we more than doubled this week and we appreciate it by 145% this month now there are many ways to look at the performance of an asset we can just look at the price in US dollars but we can also look at relative variations how much does an asset outperform another one and this is especially important when two assets are highly correlated when they tend to move at the same direction in the same time now here's a description of correlation and what we see over here is that most all coins are more correlated with ethereum than with Bitcoin in other words this number here is higher than this number over here when ethereum goes up the altcoins tend to go up as well this is not as much true for Bitcoin and so here is the relative valuation chart of kusama to ethereum we tended to Trend downwards for a long long time in underperformance of 85% but we did see our occasional relies relies of more than 100% And we are again in such a rally now are we going to see a subsequent dump again relative to Eve nobody knows but it is interesting to see what happened historically now why did this happen here I think one explanation is expanding Supply so have a look at this long-term price chart of Kosama at one point we were at above $500 and now this recent rally is just a small little blip on the price chart but when we compare this to the market cap chart this little blip suddenly becomes much larger so he went up in market cap much more than we went up in the price and that is of course because the token Supply expands over time there's actually no cap to the supply of Kosama now Kosama is closely interlined with poad do right poad do is the main chain Kosama is the test net and so poad Do's performance relative to ethereum also was not that great it went also down by 85% and it's also now outperforming recently and so it's interesting to just have a look at what is KSM doing relative to polka do and unfortunately over the very longterm it's doing worse than poad do and it shows that we might be somewhat heated we already coming down somewhat again relative to dot not necessarily in the US dollar denominated chart now not everything is bad for kusama there is actually some kind of usage increase that we can see on chain let's have a look at those statistics now check this out this is the Kosama power Chain versus relay chain upward messaging passing so it's basically a metric of how much kusama is used in in the ecosystem and this is at an all-time high here's the same for the downward message passing also at an all-time high and so yes with this price value of course the total value locked on poka dot is going up that makes a lot of sense because a lot of assets on poka dot are linked to the dot price it is interesting though how the one month total value lock change on those decentralized apps is very much in line with the price increase during that time so it's not necessarily more usage it's simply just the assets gaining value that's why the tvl is up is poot saw the mother chain used much more the answer is yes recently slightly but it does come in spikes there's no long-term adoption this is a long-term chart though it starts in August of 2020 here is what I think is going on it seems like the centralized exchanges are currently pushing up a lot of the tokens that they hold on their books not all of the tokens that a centralized exchange owns is custody tokens right it's not all customer funds some tokens are also just held for Market making and so when everybody is POS positive when everybody is bullish it might make sense to generate some attention through a price rally it might make sense to bid up the price a bit generate some attention and then be able to potentially offload at those higher prices right most trading volume now happens on binance that's on the spot Market but also on the Perpetual Futures Market we see that binance is leading with 1.7 billion worth of trading volume and so to me it appears as if this R in kusama and in pocot is not 100% natural it appears as if the market makers are pushing a lot of those kind of tokens now but the real upside I believe the real Edge is still with the onchain tokens so just have a look at what performed best in the last 7 days it's not necessarily only the tokens that are in the billions of dollars most of the best performers in the last week were just in the millions or tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but Kosama is already close to a billion the question though is when we trade those smaller Tokens The Upside is of course higher but also the risk of failure is higher right not all of those tokens rally thus it's more important to have even more information the way how I try to find those rallying tokens early is through wallet tracking so I monitor various wallets of other influencers of insiders of top Traders and I try to buy when they are buying for example have a look at this this is an alert by the martini guy that bought the moon token when it was at 466 that was directly on the pump fun platform the token subsequently had a massive pump of more than 1,000% then had a dump and even after the dump the price is still higher it's at 30 13 so it's still double the price after we have crashed that much that's how early that signal was and so here is that influencer right the martini guy he's got 149,000 subscribers and we have 12 of his wallets that we are tracking now not all of those signals are as crazy right for example here Alex Becker is buying the the Spectra token Spectra has been around for a while he bought for $246 and now we are at $267 a few hours later so a simple gain of 10% in a few hours now the reason why the token hasn't yet gone up further is probably because Alex Becker hasn't yet announced this on his channel right he's got 1.5 million subscribers when he talks about a token of course the token has to go up because of all that additional attention by the way we've also got 12 of Alex Becker's wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets and so I really like this approach I like to follow the Insiders I think it's much better than picking random tokens on a list it's better to follow the money that tends to make a lot of money too we don't have to be in the close network of those people we simply just need to figure out their wallets and that's again through onchain analytics here's a dedicated tutorial section on influencer tracking on influencer wallet Discovery there eight videos in total how do we find influencer wallets how can we track them and how can we interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about risk mitigation it's also about on analytics it's about back testing there's more than 100 videos in total once we have a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare our onch analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual altcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I font you 100% there's really zero risk for you so can Kosama rise further yes of course it can the issue though is that attention is already at a peak and at some point the market makers might consider taking some profit and push the next altcoin that they own if you got some very video you to subscribe I a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium

#crypto","AR block with the ABT token is on a massive run let's have a look at what's behind this ready let's find out whether or not it makes sense to buy AR block longterm whether or not makes sense to jump on this rally how to potentially trade this let's look at the data most people are not considering now this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at $3.77 we are up 27% today alone 67% this week and more than 3,000% this year one year ago the ABD token was at 11 Cents Only now here's something interesting AR block didn't always rally it actually saw a massive Crash from $166 all the way down to 8 so that's a drop of 95% so what's happening here why is this suddenly turning around the turnaround is especially impressive given that the market cap went up even more relatively speaking compared to the price and that difference between market cap and price is of of course due to token inflation so nowadays there's more ABT tokens floating around than at the beginning but there is some conflicting data and it's very hard to find proper toomics data on whether or not currently the supply is expanding how much is floating will there be unlocks it's not really easy to understand because have a look at coin market cap coin market cap doesn't show us how much of the supply is currently circulating it tells us that the current market cap is at 372 million and that the fully diluted Market cap is at 703 million so that would imply that less than half of the tokens are currently floating but we don't really see the statistic anywhere specifically listed here on misari we see a circulating supply of 186 million tokens in 2018 and apparently a massive burn and then no change for many many years no change in the supply would of course be very positive because most altcoins are inflationary as in more and more tokens circulate over time we can't see this at least on Miss sari. for arcblock and so you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just going to walk you through the website tell you about the marketing Jaz Etc we're going to look at the data most people are not considering here is the documentation on the AR block token and we see how the token apparently helps with the token economy and that there's a mapping between the native tokens on the AR blockchain with the erc2 tokens we're going to look at the erc20 tokens so the tokens ethereum in more detail in a second but we don't really see if there's a change in the supply over time this is not that good but again at least misari doio doesn't see any circulating Supply increase AR block had an Ico during the Boom in 2018 sold the token for half a dollar people that held until today made a 7.1x so here's always what's important to make any kind of price prediction we have to understand the supply which we kind of did we also have to understand the demand demand of course right price is the result of Demand versus Supply so how could the demand potentially change let's have a look at the development of the token as in are there a lot of people a lot of programmers programming currently for arlock pushing the project further forward creating then some demand because of those new developments so what we've got over here is the GitHub repository this is where programmer submit their code changes over here we can see how much activity there is unfortunately there isn't that much so there aren't too many programmers changing anything here there's no Supply change but there's also apparently at least according to this repository no more development on the project according to Ether scan there are 23,000 holders roughly but I build a tool to look at those holders in more detail this tool is available to the premium member so you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool and you can look at exactly those statistics for any token on ethereum on the binance smart chain on Bas on polygon on avalan on all of those evm compatible chains and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 30 Arc block tokens at the curent price that's roughly $11,000 that's what I'd consider retail and there's currently a bit under a th000 such wallets for the middle chart we go a 10x in the minimum holding threshold so that's now $10,000 worth of the token there's still 5,000 such wallets that's quite a lot especially considering that retail is that small relatively speaking normally it's not that many wallets that still hold $10,000 worth of the token and then on the right side we've got $100,000 worth of the token there are more than 1,600 such wallets very very impressive I'm not sure how natural this actually is I get a bit of an ick here that this could be manipulation potentially maybe the team just spreading out the token across more wallets yeah the same kind of charts but just for the last month and here it seems like the number of whale wallets that hold at least $100,000 worth of the token tends to be going down somewhat the chart looks more dramatic than it actually is right the drop is from 16,666 roughly to 16,600 so it's actually only 60 wallets that this went down let's dive a bit deeper here let's look at the absolute heavy weights of the token what are the mega whales doing are they currently accumulating are they currently selling are they potentially propping up the price What's Happening Here we don't need to go too advanced with that we simply go to Ether scan to the holders Tab and over here we see the largest holders the first two wallets haven't changed their balance whatsoever this seems to be project related maybe a treasury of some sorts but all the next wallets they did change their balance this is the hold up pie chart so this is those two treasury wallets I believe but let's have a look at all of those other wallets here's the first wallet that sees a balance change over time this is accumulation quite heavy accumulation since beginning of the year it went from 0.6 million all the way the way to 5 million yes the next wallet went from a bit under 1 million to 4 million yes the next also accumulation this year one more accumulation wallet and another one so the largest wallets seem to be accumulating the token this might be one of the reasons why the price is going up but the issue is that those kind of wallets are all onchain and when we actually go one step further and we look at where is all the trading activity happening and what we discover is that it's actually not on chain it happens on those black boxes it happens in the centralized exchanges have a look at this table behind me this is the trading volume according to exchanges in the last 24 hours and most trading volume happened on coinbase and on gate iio there was still some activity happening on Unis swap so that's good this is where we get our unchain metrics from but most of the trading really happens outside of the reach of open analytics there are no Perpetual futures of the arlock token so probably there's not that kind of levered manipulation but still when there's so much trading happening only on two platforms I'm not sure how much of that is really natural growth the price went up by 64% in the last month the number of small holders went up maybe by 5% or so medium-sized holders as well so getting into the token right now with this rally could potentially be dangerous I think it makes sense at least to limit the risk because in case this is all manipulation by the Wales you want to exit fast in case the price crashes the one way to do this is to use a trailing stop loss right so as the price is rising you have a stop loss and you simply adjust the stop loss as we rise further and further and then once that momentum stops once we turn around then it makes sense to exit very very fast because then we could potentially crash a lot if the whales are selling if it's your first time here feel fre to subscribe I probably you

Tokenomics,  #stellar #xlm #crypto","Stella was the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 in the last week and crypto tends to move in waves it tends to move in Trends will this trend continue let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here are the top 100 and they are ordered by the performance in the last week Stella or xlm doubled it's not just the last week where xlm did well it's also the last month it's a top performer in the last month as well you could throw your money at pretty much anything and made more but since xlm did best this week and this month does it still make sense to buy at those levels let's have a look now there's clearly attention on the token and attention sometimes turns into purchases and here's a statistic not a lot of other people will share with you this is the performance of the last Stellar video on this channel an average video is here in Gray and that first Stellar video is in blue it made 3.7 times more views than an average video now the question question is always what is driving a price R right why is something going up and in the prior video we looked at adoption of the Stella blockchain we had a look at are there more transactions are there more active wallets Etc and I don't want to repeat myself so feel free in case you haven't watched it yet to check it out the title is buy the Stella rally xlm crypto token analysis now here's the chart everybody is looking at this is the xlm chart the Stellar chart in US Dollars and it is somewhat scary because you have seen very similar pump and dumps in the past the price shot up to then subsequently bleed for the next 1 to 2 years so it's a case of fool me once fool me twice are we getting fooled a third time now it appears as if this current R isn't yet over as in we've seen prices of 68 cents and 74 cents at its peak but this is just the price we haven't looked at the market cap Stella is an inflating token there's now way more xlm tokens around than in 2018 and so in terms of market cap we are very close to historical Heights now was there any kind of indication that would have pointed towards buying Stella before this rally I believe the answer is yes and it's in relative valuation charts so when we don't look at xlm in US dollars but when we look at it relative to bitcoin then we do see a quite interesting flaw have a look at this here this is the Stellar price relative to bitcoin a very long-term chart starting in 2014 and the bottom that we saw in March of 2017 relative to bitcoin is the exact same bottom that we've just recently seen so we're bouncing off exactly at the Historical low I do not think that this is coincidence a lot of people say that technical analysis is worth nothing but things like this right turn around at the exact same point in time with the relative variation to bitcoin I don't think it just happens out of nothing I do believe that there is some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy here and with s fulfilling prophecy I simply mean that if enough people look at that data at the same time and enough people agree that it's currently comparatively cheap and that it might make sense to buy at that point that enough people do buy and then the prophecy self fulfills itself now on this channel I like to look at onchain analytics I like to look at the buyers and sellers of the token who is currently driving prices now unfortunately most of trading volume happens in centralized exchanges in the black boxes we can't really transparently look at what's happening over there in the order books but there is a ported token of xlm on the binance smart chain and over here we can see what's going on so before we look at the onchain analytics one quick view at what's going on with trading volume most trading volume happens of course on binance followed by coinbase followed by xt. comom which is a WID labeled version of binance now this is the spot market we've also got the Perpetual Futures Market where it's not just binance that's involved but also by bit now for the ported version on the binance smart chain we've got a bit under 14,000 holders but not all of those 14,000 holders are created equally some might only hold a few cents of the token others might hold thousands of the token and so what we see over here is the number of retail investors medium-sized investors and whale investors and we differentiate by holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least a th000 stellar tokens so at the current price that's roughly $500 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in M hold holding so that's now $5,000 worth of the token on the right side it's the Wales at least for the B smart chain it's $50,000 worth of the token all wet cohorts long-term so since porting to the binance smart chain in July of 2021 tended to accumulate over time but the question is what happened on chain in the last month where the price almost 5x so it went up almost 400% here's the answer to that question retail investors actually did not accumulate on chain mediumsized also did not accumulate and the number of whales did go up not by much but it did slightly go up what we do see though is that the number of new wallets tends to grow with that price R so again this is the last month only and initially we only had like 10 or so new users on the bance smart chain that bought Stella now it's around 200 it is slowing down yesterday was only 100 and today is a data point we can't yet take into consideration because today hasn't yet finished but there's definitely some growth there is though more trading of returning users versus new users which makes sense because the token has been around for a very long time here's the number of buyers and sellers over time and again we see how there's a tension moves and currently we are spiking very high in attention and unfortunately we do not necessarily want to buy when attention is at its maximum right there is a correlation between attention and price when attention is high the price is high but attention tends to move from token to token when it moves away from sell this might not be that great for the token now the crypto Market Market as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly and I like to look at the stable coin market cap to determine whether or not we're currently in the bull market or in a bare market and that is the chart we see over here sometimes we see the stable coin market cap going up sometimes we see it going down and the reason why I like this chart so much is because it has very little volatility right it doesn't go tically up and down like the Bitcoin price or like the Dogecoin price it has very clear Trends what happened over here was the defi collapse of the anchor protocol right so this is when Terra Luna went bust this is when the US stable coin depack this is when a lot of people withdrew money from crypto it started a whole Bare market and during that bare Market Bitcoin went from 69k all the way down to 16k and also FTX collapsed during that bare Market since October of last year we see an expansion of the stable coin market cap again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the reason why this chart is so useful is not just because we can see clearly the trend where currently the crypto Market is at what's also nice about it is that we can deterministically say that currently money is flowing into crypto as in traditional Finance the traditional Finance world is moving Fiat into the crypto space because whenever this is going up this means that you send for example your US dollars to binance and binance then sends this to a custodian of stable coins let's say tether tether then takes custody of your money right it puts it in some kind of bank account or in some kind of bonds and then mince the tokens on the blockchain and we can see the tether minting here in this chart and so the exact opposite happens when this is going down this is when you withdraw your fiat currency from binance and so I think there's roughly 177 billion reasons to believe that the price of crypto is likely going to continue to rise from here all of crypto and so this is what I mean with all of crypto right crypto is highly correlated to one another when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well but they don't go up to the same degree here are the top 100 alt coins in the last 7 Days ordered by their performance and the best performer was Stella with a bit over 100% but have a look at this this is the best performing meme coins in the last s days and we've got chill guy with more than 3,000% in the last 7 days we talked about chill guy several times on this channel but we also talked about the goat token several times on this channel when it was still very very cheap now goat is the largest of the meme coins on the Solana blockchain that had been launched with pump. fun so pump. fun is the Launchpad of mem coins on Solana there's a lot of trading happening over there and goat has the largest market cap now I made a video on Goat when it was still at 24 cents that was on the 16th of October subsequently the price went up by more than 500% now recently it came down again a bit and so I tried to find tokens that currently have positive momentum that still have a lot of upside potential tokens that can still do the 345 X's that are probably not possible anymore with the larger tokens so if you're interested in being early in those kind of bets then feel free to subscribe to this channel right I publish videos regularly here now how did I find out about the gold token for example that early the answer is wallet tracking have a look at this influencer Kyle Chessie bought the gold token already at 14 cents so that was over here subsequently the price went up by more than 800% now what is wallet tracking the blockchain is completely transparent right we can see who's buying who's selling the only difficult part is to find out what are the wallets that are important who owns what kind of wallets what kind of wallets actually make money and so here is Kyle chesse he's got more than 130,000 subscribers he's the person that bought gold early and so through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets we always get a signal when he's buying or selling something or have a look at this alert from today bankless bought the clanker token for $53 since then the price went up by 57% again that's in a matter of a few hours and have a look at this below right this is the onchain analytics that one of our moderators performed on The Token here's the bankless channel they've got almost a quarter of a million subscribers and of course when they talk about a token this generates a lot of attention and attention then means purchases and purchases mean a rising price we only have two of Bank L's wallets but we try to find more again we use onch analytics and we have our people in the chats that use various methods to find wallets of people that move markets I want to share one more trade and it's probably the most impressive of the trades because it turns a micro cap into a pretty large pump and dump this was on November 23rd the martini guy bought the moon token on pump fun right we already talked about pump. fun and he did this at a price of 412 this is how that developed once a got traded on radium ined up by more than 1,000% now it's at 434 so even after the dump we are still up by roughly 3x that's how early those kind of signals are here is the martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers roughly and here are the wallets that we Track by this guy 12 in total we now have exactly 500 wallets in our tracking so it's not just the three influencers that I just mentioned we've got way more and so this is I believe the real way to make money in crypto right you want to know things that most people don't know how else can you buy lower than others and sell higher than others if you don't have a market Edge if you don't know more than others it's better to be very closely to the people that buy early and then potentially sell when all the masses come and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it is eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to set up the the tracking for the influencer wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about the back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell what are the current onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel fore to check it out it's currently $125 per month the price will increase next week so you can lock in still this old price and keep that old price there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you do not like premium just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to keep on holding Stella probably yes because Stella will appreciate with the rest of the market most likely that being said is it the best risk to reward play I'm not so sure because attention right now shortterm is very high and there is correlation between attention and price I think the best upside is in the small tokens in the very small market cap tokens potentially the meme coins especially if you've got a market Edge especially if you know things most people don't if you got some very video feel you to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM2aCxz7FSA,"['Bitcoin',

üü¢What is XING Coin üíµ XING  Crypto Token AnalysisüöÄ,"**XING Coin** does not refer to a widely recognized or established cryptocurrency as of now. However, if there is a new or upcoming token named ""XING Coin,"" it might be inspired by various themes, including culture, technology, or even a play on words. In general, analyzing a new or speculative cryptocurrency like XING Coin involves understanding its purpose, tokenomics, use cases, and potential community impact.  ---  ### Potential Aspects of XING Coin  If XING Coin were a real project, here are some of the characteristics and analysis points that would be relevant:  1. **Purpose and Theme**:    - The name ""XING"" could imply a connection to a cultural or symbolic theme. For instance, it might be related to an Asian cultural reference or denote something more abstract like ""crossing"" or ""intersection"" in English.    - Like many meme or themed coins, XING Coin might focus on a specific niche or community, leveraging unique branding to attract attention.  2. **Blockchain Platform**:    - XING Coin would likely be launched on a popular and easily accessible blockchain, such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), or Solana, which are commonly used for new token projects.    - The choice of blockchain could affect transaction fees, speed, and overall accessibility.  3. **Tokenomics**:    - **Total Supply**: New coins often have a large total supply, sometimes in the billions or even trillions, to make individual tokens feel more accessible.    - **Burn Mechanism**: To create scarcity and support price increases, some projects implement a token burn mechanism, where a portion of tokens is periodically destroyed.    - **Rewards and Staking**: There may be features like staking rewards, where holders can earn more tokens by locking their holdings for a set period.  4. **Potential Use Cases**:    - **Community Token**: If XING Coin is meme-themed, it could be used for community engagement, tipping, and supporting social media initiatives.    - **Utility**: Some meme coins incorporate additional features, such as governance (allowing holders to vote on project decisions) or partnerships with NFT platforms.    - **Charity and Fundraising**: Many meme coins engage in philanthropy, so XING Coin could dedicate a portion of its proceeds to charitable causes.  ---  ### Key Factors to Analyze for XING Coin  1. **Whitepaper and Roadmap**:    - A legitimate project will have a clear whitepaper detailing its goals, use cases, and technology.    - A roadmap outlining future milestones, such as exchange listings, partnerships, or feature rollouts, adds credibility.  2. **Team Transparency**:    - Knowing who is behind the project is important. Transparent and experienced developers inspire more confidence.    - Anonymous teams are common in the meme coin space but should be approached with caution.  3. **Community and Social Media**:    - Meme coins thrive on community support. Platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord are key places to gauge community activity and sentiment.    - Look for active engagement, meme culture, and influencers talking about XING Coin.  4. **Market Presence**:    - Check if XING Coin is listed on major exchanges or only available through decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Being listed on a reputable exchange can increase a token's legitimacy.    - Partnerships with other projects or platforms can also boost credibility.   #XINGCoin #Crypto #MemeCoin #Blockchain #Cryptocurrency #TokenAnalysis #Investment #CommunityToken #DYOR #CryptoMarket #HypeInvestments","hello everyone dear friends with you cryptomax and today review m coins king xink that's such a pretty monkey that started on the eighth of November because of a very short period of time uh has a capitalization of twenty five million subscribers of the holder of this mm coins three thousand one hundred sixty seven liquidity of this memcoin is eight hundred twenty nine thousand pretty interesting promising ma'am coin who shot here literally yesterday and gave already first first gave hundred X given ma'am coin gave hundred x pretty taki grew up really fast and let's sort it out go to the site where the caterminal and see here that this auditor terminal says aa score its only fifty one percent the schedule as you can see here is crazy he is only eleven days old to this project but he gave even a thousand two hundred seventy four percent that's a lot in such a short amount of time I will say again The capitalization of this project is uh in twenty five million dollars here we go further let's see the holder of this coin meme what quantity three thousand two hundred and five people as you can see there are people who hold by nine hundred eight hundred and eighty thousand dollars uh also let's take a look at the website loot max and here we will see in more detail that I don't see any obvious monopolists here. two percent and four two and two percent one and five is still pretty much simple and loyal you can also go to the bull x website and on the bulyx you can see that the top ten holders has just fifteen percent of all coins are yes wallets that have six hundred and five hundred four hundred and three hundred thousand dollars at the moment coins well also lets go over on the wallet of a given coin and we will see what the it's only eight hundred fifty six dollars here this is the coin itself xing and a little bit of salons more and more on the wallet there is nothing here also let's switch to safety on rivers check and see the following that this mmc one is characterized by pretty still not bad everything is fine only very small amount well about failed everything is very small well, so basically top holders ten percent of them aren't that much everything is fine here can also go on click check and on click check see what here the score is also only fifty percent out of a hundred I remind you that this coin pushed at half a file that's the kind of uh king ah let's understand why such xing became very popular and you like and subscribe to my channel and I'll tell you a secret that this ma'am code has a huge community in tiktok in tiktok it has almost five hundred seventy seven thousand followers that's the kind of monkey pretty monkey very popular which has less a lot of views and a huge community here from tiktok data people decided to do ma'am coink sing that's where this ma'am coin flew from go further look at code code is rated one hundred percent out of a hundred well and holders as you can see the top three holders have six percent of the total of all coins and top ten holders have sixteen percent of the volume of all coins pretty taki everything is fine here and beautiful well and social networks let's go to social networks telegram in the telegram there are only sixty-three followers here in eleven days it's very, very small but also of course k sing is such a monkey we will go to X and here we will see that given this page was created in the twentieth year has four hundred and eighty subscribers to this monkey xing like this so pretty still not bad in such a short period of time this monkey if she knew has such a huge capitalization at twenty five very pretty monkey y'all look at those eyes and how she eats ice cream this is fantastic just fantastic also she is here chuffed cut eat bananas pretty interesting coin at the salon which has a very minimal price just right now in two cents having still everything ahead Well, let me remind you that capitalization in the region of twenty million this is just the beginning she started at all started at a price once two three four four zero nine and already closed well one thousand two hundred percent and this is what it is like this is how people on pamphan earn that's not financial advice it's recommendations review given coin meme cupcake if you liked this video put like subscribe to my channel go to my playlists i have a lot of interesting coin meme and reviews everyone thank you for your attention everyone bye",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywjf6cNGDr8,"['JUST', 'Secret', 'WHY', 'SIX']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ywjf6cNGDr8/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-20T08:15:04Z

#crypto","the chill guy token is doing exactly what the name implies it's just chilling around for the last week we've seen zero price action but 2 weeks ago the price was rallying massively what's going on here will we see another rally let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's have a look at the buyers and sellers of the token so here is what I'm talking about we are currently at 50 cents and we had been at pretty much the exact same level 8 days ago why did chill guy run out of steam after it went up by more than 260,000 per. this is somewhat surprising because we do have news around the token for example over here we've got bitg listing the token and we even now have binance offering Perpetual Futures on the token and this news came out yesterday yet the price stands still what is going on now this channel approaches analysis a bit different to most other crypto channels most people just look at Price charts right they draw random lines on price charts they see there's a support here's a resistance this is a trading range Etc but nobody looks behind that price action what's actually driving a rally what's actually driving standstill or potentially a sell off and so here we look at what's actually happening under the hood because that's the beauty of the blockchain we can directly look at the transactions we can look at the number of wallets we can look at transaction volumes Etc something we do not have available for tradition traditional Finance like the stock market and what we see over here in those two charts is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders per day so the firsttime Traders are in purple the recurring Traders are in orange and we see nicely how initially this momentum built up as in the number of firsttime Traders was always larger than the number of recurring Traders and that tended to be even by a multiple X we then saw a peak on the 20th of November yet still on most days we saw the number of firsttime Traders being higher than the number of recurring Traders this has changed yesterday yesterday was the very first time where there were more traders that already owned the token that we're buying and selling compared to new Traders coming in now why does this matter it matters because for a price to go up we need to see the investor base growing right we need to see more and more people coming into a token if those new people stop coming and the price has a hard time appreciating as well now let's have a look at this 20th of November that was over here that was pretty much when the price peaked and since then we tend to go sideways now what we see here on the right is the number of token transactions per day and that tends to be somewhat delayed usually it Peaks maybe one or two days after the number of first-time Traders Peaks and that's also what we can observe over here the number of token transactions peaked one day afterwards on the 21st of November now not everybody just looks at Price data right some people also look at trading volume as in how many tokens get get traded on a particular period of time it is a useful indicator but we can refine this further so most people just look at this over here and whenever trading volume spikes this is also an indication that attention spikes and sometimes when the trading volume comes down the price also tends to go down this is not true for the Cher guy token because probably the centralized exchanges bought up some of the tokens for their Market making but if there's no such thing as an upcoming listing usually when trading volume goes down prices tend to decline and so this is usually how most people look at this this is all the information that get considered but have a look at this this is again the trading volume this time on the left side in US Dollars on the right side normalized to 100% per day but there is a Twist to this we are segmenting the trading volume by wallet size so small retail is all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to $10,000 large retail is up to $100,000 and Wales is above $100,000 now have a look at the small retail trading yes the trading volume spiked at the same time as the rest of the market but it came down much slower in other words small retail tends to be not as reactive as the larger wallets compare this with mediumsized retail that's way more aggressive and for large retail it's even more pronounced we can also see that over time the fraction of trading volume done by retail tends to rather decline it doesn't decline in the last week anymore where there's no more price action but it definitely did decline during the rally and so there are several indications that the price is currently staying stable because the centralized exchanges bought or are still buying the token the onchain investor that bought the token before the centralized exchange listing tends to rather now offload and that's true for the small retail investor it's also true for the whale so this is the number of wallets over time and we've got different holding thresholds to to distinguish what is a retail investor and what is a whale investor and those thresholds are 2,000 tokens 20,000 tokens and 200,000 tokens and so since the price is currently at roughly 50 this equates to a minimum holding of $1,000 $110,000 $100,000 and again we see how the number of holders tends to rather decline the price however is not declining and So currently gate iio is dominating the price discovery on the spot Market this is where most trading volume happens afterwards we've got radium so this is still trading on chain and then we've got bybit the trading volume in the Futures Market especially on binance is way larger than that though so this is bets on the price those are derivatives those are levered instruments and the more trading volume happens here the more money binance makes and so what's the theoretical upside here chill guy is currently at a market cap of roughly half a billion the largest of the pump. fun ecosystem tokens is at 1.1 billion so that would imply a maximum upside of maybe 2x but if you're going outside of the pump. fun ecosystem of course has way larger meme coins as well a 4X would bring it close to FY Eno a 6X close to dog with head and with a 7x chill guy would beat the largest of the tokens on the Solana blockchain which is Bonk so that's probably the absolute upper ceiling that's $350 right now roughly and so here's what I think will happen with the chill guide token the centralized exchanges have an incentive to create vol ility here they bought more and more of the token they also offer up perpet Futures and so they're likely going to manipulate the price in both directions this might be a sudden crash out of nothing this might be a sudden R both as possible but volatility is likely going to increase and ATT tension will increase with that as well now here's a very interesting recent development you very likely do not have access to this kind of chart this year shows how much advertisers on my YouTube channel pay for $1,000 views of their ads and it's suddenly out of nothing spiked to roughly double of what it used to be in other words crypto projects centralized exchanges Etc they are now competing for advertising space in the crypto scene and it's not just money that's flowing into advertising for crypto there's also simply Fiat money that's flowing into the space as a whole the stable coin market cap tends to rise and it's recently even accelerating so since October of last year we see money flowing into crypto again that of course causes a lot of crypto asset prices to go up and especially in the recent days since beginning of the month we also see the alt coins going up in aggregate so what we have over here is the others dominance this is how much of all of crypto is in the alt coins that's not in the top 10 that went up by roughly 20% in the last month and so pretty much everything is now going up the art in crypto trading though is to buy early right it's to buy when the prices are still low so for example over here the chill guy token it's now at0 50 Cent but I made it video on chill guy when it was still at 20 cents and I hope a lot of you made money with that video because it was a quite popular one and so this is the real art right we have to get into tokens when momentum is bullish and when there's still enough upside potential and so this is what this channel is all about right it's about discussing tokens that a lot of people don't yet have on their radar so feel free to subscribe now how can I find tokens like chill guy early how can I find things like the goat token or the ACT token early those are one of the largest pump. fun ecosystem tokens this is a wallet tracking alert how Kyle Chessie bought the gold token for 14 that was over here since then the price went up by more than 500% temporarily it was up by more than 800% who is ky chesse it's this influencer over here he's got 137,000 subscribers and he tends to be relatively early on trending tokens and so here is how that works we use onchain analytics again to figure out who is owning what wallet it's not a very easy task but we've got an entire community that just focuses on that single task find wallets that are very useful of insiders of top traders of influencers let's find those wallets and then track them so over here we've got the wallets that we Track by Kyle Chessy we've got 12 in total well let's talk about the ACT token here's our signal for act cryp Benta bought the ACT token at 3.7 now it's at 58 so an increase of 1,500% since that signal and of course temporarily the gain was even higher more than 2,000% now where do crazy gains like this come from they come from attention they come from a lot of eyeballs getting into one single token and so here are those eyeballs this is the Crypt Channel they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token of course the token has to go up and so we've got 33 of Crypt banter wallets and so really I think this is the better approach compared to just drawing random lines on price charts I think it's better to follow the smart money it's better to follow the Insiders it's better to Simply copy trade the people that tend to make money in crypto and I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on this how can we find various influencer wallets how can we trade track those wallets and how can we subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the trkking it's eight videos in total it's all part of Premium so that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about portfolio diversification risk management indicator back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we get our wallet signals we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare the onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual all coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $1 165 us per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything simply just message me within the first 7 days and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so it does it make sense to buy the chill guy token now I believe that the manipulation by the centralized exchanges will increase thus it's very hard to predict what's actually going to happen whatever price movement is going to happen will be some kind of manipulation if we suddenly see a rally out of nothing with zero news then a lot of people might be betting on falling prices if that happens it might make sense to look at the Perpetual Futures funding rates if the funding rates turn deeply positive and it cost a lot of money to Long the token to bet on Rising prices then the token might crash right because the centralized exchanges earn money from Liquidation fees if the funding rates turn negative in everybody body bets on falling prices we might see a short squeeze so this is becoming increasingly a game of looking at what's happening with the centralized exchange data not necessarily anymore what happens on chain because the ownership is now gradually moving to the centralized exchanges and they dictate where the price is going it's kind of like you are the sports betting house you offer bets on an outcome of a football game for example but at the same time you have an impact on how the game will end you have bought the referee that's pretty much what's currently happening with chill guy there there is an offering on the bets of the price right the Perpetual Futures contracts but at the same time those centralized exchanges also own a lot of the token and they can dictate where the price is going if you got some value on this video feel you to subscribe I publish you regularly a like

Prediction,Ton longterm,Ton Tokenomics  #ton #toncoin #crypto",it is very easy to overlook ton coin there was pretty much no price action whatsoever in the last month we went sideways however the over Market itself imploded so ton coin did pretty well relative to bitcoin for example and that's not just during the bare Market even in the last year where Bitcoin almost doubled ton coin more than 5x now where does this outperformance come from let's have a look at relative valuation metrics long-term let's have a look at some on data most people aren't considering let's see why capital is flowing into ton so check this out this is Def Lama and it shows us the total value locks development of various blockchains over different time frames and when we look at the last month all blockchains but ton lost value it's clearly a Winner Takes most game ton grew its total value locked by almost 60% the rest lost total value locked somewhere between 7% and 4 6% and so that's then how that looks like on a chart this is the total value locked of ton over time this is measured in US Dollars we did see a bit of a hiccup in US dollars in the last few days measured in ton though we don't see that hiccup we see continued growth we are now at an all-time high in total value locked measured in ton tokens now the big question with any altcoin especially in a bare Market where we don't see a lot of capital inflows the big question is always to economics how much is potentially the the token diluting how much more Supply could hit the market and at first glance this doesn't look that great because the circulating Supply is 2.5 billion ton tokens the total Supply is 5.1 billion so we've got pretty much a 2X in Supply that's going to hit the market but here's the thing that Supply will not hit the market very soon again this is defi Lama this is the T N locker and we had a lot of token inflation in 2021 and partially in 2022 now we are going flat and only until end of 2025 do we see some kind of increase again now let's overlay this with the price and market cap chart and have a look at how nicely this correlates when the supply goes up the price and market cap tend to go down when the supply doesn't grow anymore then there is potential room for growth in other words there is a real chance that very long term in 2026 20 27 and 2028 the price could again as it did in the past underperform ethereum and Bitcoin the largest defi protocol on the ton blockchain is dust dust has 358 million in total value locked here's the total value locked development over time and the reason why dust is attracting so much capital is because the trading volume is high thus the A on depositing ton with tether for example are comparatively elevated if you deploy half ton half usdt on Dust you get an apri of 72% on tokens that are not inflationary now I always like to look at relative valuation charts right because when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up then all the altcoins tend to go up as well and vice versa so what we actually want to do is we want to see at an altcoin performance relative to ethereum or relative to bitcoin right we want to get this extra risk that we take on by buying altcoin we want to get that extra risk paid for now most people only look at the relative valuation to bitcoin I personally prefer relative valuations to ethereum and here is why have a look at the correlation coefficients of various altcoins to bitcoin and to ethereum so the First Column versus the second column the First Column tends to have lower numbers compared to the second column in other words the alt coins tend to move more in sync with ethereum they're higher correlated with ethereum compared to bitcoin and that makes sense right people that get into ethereum tend to be more active crypto participants people that buy Bitcoin simply just buy and hold and so there is just from a market psychology perspective already a better connection between Eve and the alts so let's outperform Eve let's look at ton relative to ethereum the Chart behind me this goes in an interesting trading range with quiet a bit of volatility from bottom to top we've got a more than 300% rally outperformance versus ethereum from Top top to bottom we see an underperformance of 71% so massive ups and downs over the long term rather increasing currently we are somewhat elevated we aren't though at maximum Heights yet that are another 35% or so away from here can this long-term Trend break could we potentially go even higher yes of course we could especially if we continue to see ton outperforming in terms of adoption versus the other chains unfortunately we haven't seen that much in the last 7 days but i''s simply just keep an eye on this here's another interesting way to look at relative valuation this here is ton dominance so how much of all of cryptocurrency market cap is locked up in ton ton currently is the eighth largest cryptocurrency it's got a market cap of 18 billion and with that 0.9% roughly of all of crypto is in ton again we see this long-term upwards Trend those lines are not necessarily science but sometimes they do become self-fulfilling profit phes and with this metric we are even more balanced we are not that expensive which is very different to the relative ethereum valuation chart I'm planning to continue to do updates on ton in case you're

thus we want to find out is there potentially some outperformance to be made with the mumu token we are going to look at onchain metric most people aren't considering we're going to look at the retail adoption versus the whale adoption so here is what we're going to look at it's ticker Syble Mumu it's on Solana it's traded on radium the price is at 44 and the token starts with 5 L afq now there are some interesting things about this pump and dump over here the price first shot up by more than 10x to then subsequently crash by More than 70% who depressed the price here is there potential price manipulation going on let's have a look at the data Beyond just the website so let's see if the numbers match on Twitter we've got 44,000 followers on telegram we've got 12,000 subscribers and on chain we've got 61,000 holders so this is all in the similar ballpack it seems like at least somebody is inflating all the numbers to the same degree that this is all natural now the nice thing about the mumu token is that most of the trading volume still happens on chain there is Maxi there is binance but most of the trading volume happens on radium thus we can have a look directly at who's buying who's selling here so let's first start off with the trading volume measured in US Dollars over time trading tends to happen in waves with the largest wave peing on the 25th of July the price Peak 4 days after that we can also see that those waves aren't as significant when we just isolate small retail so that's all wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token they are a bit more pronounced when we look at medium-sized retail they're even more pronounced with large retail and when we at the Wales we can actually see who drove that rally at the end of July it was the large players this was not just slow retail adoption this was a few whales pumping up the price now I always like to look at the number of new investors versus recurring investors on a given day and the reason is when there's more and more new investors coming onto a mcoin the price can potentially rise right when it's just recurring investors trading against one another the price might not necessarily go up and so at first I was delighted to see this this shows the number of firsttime traders in purple and the number of recurring Traders in Orange and there was a lot of first-time Traders yesterday but then I looked a bit deeper when we break this up by the hour this does does not look natural whatsoever all of those firsttime Traders came within the span of 3 hours if this was natural we might see still a very quick Spike but we would see some kind of gradual decline right if a lot of people come in for example because of a marketing effort but this looks very artificial this looks like a lot of Bot accounts had been created let's have a look at the number of holders over time based on different holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 20 million Mumu tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 that's what I consider retail in the middle we go at 10x so that's a minimum of $200 million or $10,000 and on the right we've got the 2 billion Mark or $100,000 worth of the token and so we can see how small retail continues to accumulate not as quickly as at the beginning but still some accumulation medium-sized retail also might still slightly accumulate the large whales are definitely not buying anymore the number of Wales tends to rather decline since beginning of the month and so it's very fascinating to see these massive price movements especially around the end of July when the number of retail wallets didn't really grow at the end of July again most trading happens on chain it looks like something fishy is going on there seem to be bot accounts it seems like the price Peak was mainly driven by the large wallets not by small retail and so it's very hard to predict where this will go will the Wales manipulate yet again if we see another surprise rally with a lot of trading volume then it's probably a good idea to take advantage of those elevated prices yes the number of Wales is declining slightly but it's definitely not a very fast decline and so maybe we have seen some kind of a floor and the general positivity of the crypto Market can encourage the Wales to pump this up

and dumps we have seen quite a bit of a rally with the coinbase listing subsequently there was a short squeeze but since that short squeeze we rather trickling downwards can we see a recovery let's have a look at some onchain data let's look at the blockchain data most people aren't considering now we're currently at 0.75 cents and this month we went up by 41% but most of that was due to the coinbase list thing and then the subsequent short squeeze now deun launched its own chain the Deon chain you could simply bridge over funds from base to deun and then you could swap various altcoins all of those altcoins are directly linked with the deun token so when the D token goes down then those alt coins go down to the same degree that's why we are seeing red everywhere because djen is going down and pushing down those liquidity pools now there have been two waves of attention the first one was with the launch of the dent chain a lot of money went into the token then things went quiet again and then came the coinbase listing and so if we just add up all the trading volume over time we see quite a bit of a step function here but that's all old news right this happened on the 2nd of October and if you're early with news like this of course you can make money but then what happens is People BET on falling prices right the price was deflating the interest was deflating the trading volume was going down and when there are enough people betting on falling prices because that's what usually happens after such a listing people take profit but if there's enough people that bet on falling prices a short squeeze happens so people simply buy up the token to force liquidate all those short Sellers and again those effects are temporary but they can have a lot of price impact as well now let's have a look at what's currently happening with dun who is currently buying who's currently selling what's actually going on before we do this feel free to subscribe I publish video on dun regularly on this channel and it's not just videos on dun it's videos on a lot of different alt coins now according to the base chain Explorer we've got more than 700,000 holders of deun but not all of those holders have a lot of the token on the left side we see the number of holders that have roughly $1,000 worth of the token on the right side we see the number of holders with $100,000 of the token in the middle we see the number of holders with $10,000 and so we see this initial excitement that then peaked in May of this year and subsequently all wallet cohorts tended to sell now there was a bit of a spike due to the coinbase listing again at the beginning of October but that also tends to now fade now there is one more interesting data point it seems like small retail tends to be a bit slower so the attention for small retail peaked at the beginning of May the attention of mediumsized retail peaked at the end of March March the number of Wales peaked already at the 15th of March so the larger the wallet the earlier they exited and that Delta is several days in delay the price by the way peaked at the end of March so the whales were a bit too early to sell mediumsized retail did it right and of course small retail was exit liquidity as happens so often the main problem with crypto YouTube is conflict of interest too many YouTubers shill garbage promote garbage and fill up their pockets in the background not this channel instead there's simply the offer where I share my skills my perspectives to you and where I also share direct access to me where I can ask me any questions feel free to check it out the premium membership link is down below I believe crypto in general works this way the whales tend to make the better calls they tend to take the money from the small people so of course Bitcoin is both a game of luck and skill but the more skill one has the more the capital concentrates in a wallet and so that's why I like to look at the larger wallets right the larger wallets tend to do on average the better calls and so yes recently we do see a bit more trading activity again but a lot of those buyers and sellers are bought accounts or are very small holders because again the wallets that have at least $1,000 worth of the coin only sum up to less than 5,000 now unfortunately the Deen chain pretty much became a complete failure in the last 24 hours we only had 27 $7,000 worth of trading volume for other blockchains even the more obscure ones like Phantom they are in the millions and the leaders are in the hundreds of millions even in the billions and so looking at all of those numbers it seems like it's all hopeless it seems like it makes no sense to buy there is zero attention on the Chain there is zero usage of the chain who should buy deun but there's one small little glimmer of hope and that's the buyer versus seller dynamic in the very short term when we're looking at the number of buyers versus number of sellers we see quite a bit of overhang of sellers so roughly 60% sellers versus 40% buyers usually such a big Distortion would push down the price much more than just 6% what this means is that the liquidity is still relatively large relative to the trading volume so even if people are currently selling massively even though everybody is super bearish the price doesn't decline that quickly and that could give hope that we are somewhat stabilizing in the price the question though is will there be another piece of positive news that could potentially double the price we don't see that we are likely going to continue to bleed but not at a very quick Pace I'm personally not buying djen right now I buy other tokens where there's way more momentum where there's way more attention if you want to know what I'm

#departmentofgovernmentefficiency #doge #crypto","the department of government efficiency token had been quite the r just two weeks ago now it's getting somewhat silent what's going on here why did the price depress Who Sold there and does it still make sense to buy right now let's have a look at some onchain data most people aren't considering let's dive deeper into the details because that's the mistake I see many people do most people just look at Price data most people just draw random lines on price charts but there's way more behind behind this right with onchain analytics with the things that are actually going on on chain we can figure out what's driving the price action now we are currently at 27 and we went down from the all-time high by 46% have we seen the floor are we starting our recovery who's buying here now I made a video on this token not so long ago it was published 18 days ago it outperformed the average video by 80% and the continuous search volume shows us that there still interest in the token now there are some red flags here when we compare for example the social metrix to the onchain metrix yes this is a token that's native to Elon Musk and to the xplatform right X is owned by Elon Musk and so there is some kind of expectation that there are a lot of followers that being said we've got 95,000 followers on Twitter 13,000 members in the telegram chat but only 25 26,000 holders on chain does it really make sense that there's almost four times more Twitter followers than people that actually bought the token I don't think so right most of the time what we see is of course more Hold Us on chain then follow us on Twitter not so here apparently the token is relatively well distributed there aren't too many wallets that hold 10 20 30% of the supply we even have 2% of the supply sent to a debt wallet now let's have a look at long-term the number of retail investors versus whale investors and the way you make this distinction is with minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 3,000 Doge tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 for the chart in the middle that's $30,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token and on the right it's another 10x so that's $3,000 tokens or $100,000 worth of the token we do see quite constant accumulation by small retail and mediumsized Retail we see holding by the big whales so the number of Wales did not necessarily go down in the last weeks at the same time we can clearly see the waves of attention for the token whenever there's some news around the department of government efficiency the token tends to heat up as well so of course there was a wave when the token launched then a secondary wave at the beginning of September and so the number of buyers and sellers fluctuates we've seen the largest amount of buyers and sellers on the 13th of November and that's also very close to where the price spiked the absolute price spike was one day afterwards 2: CL at the 14th of November but yeah it shows very nicely how there is a correlation between aention and price action whenever attention is low the price tends to bottom whenever tension is high it tends to Peak now what happened in the last month the price of course went up by more than 500% but how did those holder numbers change here we've got the same kind of holding thresholds but only for the last month and the number of retail investors doubled in the first half of the month the number of medium-sized wallets grew by roughly 30 % and the number of Wales stayed stable and again we can see how all of the price appreciation happened in the first half of the month if there is no growth so when the number of retail investors is just flat what tends to happen is that the price rather deflates not necessarily in the last few days but overall we need to see growth of the overall investor base for the price to go up when we look at the last month in terms of new versus returning users or let's say wallets that traded the token again we can see our Peak on the 13th of November the ratio of new users versus returning users didn't really change that much over time and so what does this tell us it tells us again that the majority of people that trade crypto tend to lose right if you're part of that majority that bought on this very active day you're probably now in the minus if you bought before that you are in the profit you don't want to buy when attention is the highest you want to buy when attention is rather low and I'm not sure if attention is already at rock bottom if you continue to deflate for a bit longer maybe for another week or two then the price is likely going to come down as well this data is really really useful right it seems like those kinds of waves are somewhat predictable and it looks like overall this trend is still down despite having seen a bit more attention in the last 3 days it doesn't look like this is still sustainable and all of this data is very reliable because the price Discovery still happens on chain so have a look at this table most trading volume still happens directly on un swap yes the token can be bought on gate iio on Max c as well but that's not where the majority of trading volume happens most buyers and sellers directly transfer on chain now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stable coin market cap and this is a three-year chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stable coin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collapse so this is when anchor product call went bust this is when us depack the market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FDX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stable coin Market kept going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clear in the short term though we might be slightly heated what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to Peck at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential flaw here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the alt coins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of a i agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long longterm chart very impressive and the big question is how can we buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet tracking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bitboy crypto sold virtual tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 cents so since then the price went up by 2,500 per. who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky plays regularly he's got one 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these buy and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle Chessie that bought $100,000 worth of the token and that was at 48 and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin tray.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dedicated Chets for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first 7 days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to buy the department of government efficiency token right now I am not so sure it seems like we are still somewhat elevated in attention the attention tends to slow down and there is a link between price and attention once the price doesn't go down anymore and the trading volume doesn't go down anymore and we see some kind of a floor that's the point in time to buy right it's to buy when nobody else is looking you don't want to buy when everybody gets hyped up about a token you want to buy when there's nobody interested in a token and then hope that at some point in time there will be another news event about the department of government efficiency that then generates all of those eyeballs again on the token that pushes up the price so I don't have a crystal ball either but I believe it might make sense to wait for another week or two and then potentially buy lower and then wait for that news event and then sell whenever all of those people buy and sell again right whenever the trading volume spikes up again if you got some value all this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would

so it seems like there's almost a 2X from here to get back to Old Heights should we wait well what a lot of people do not realize is that we've actually already seen an alltime high what we've got over here in blue is the market cap of Solana so yes the price did not hit an all-time high but the market kept it and that's because of token inflation as in there's way more Solana tokens floating today then back in 2021 now the big question is is there still upside potential how much adoption do we currently see how much usage do we currently see what's Solana's valuation relative to the rest of the crypto space let's have a look at potential ups and downsides so over here we've got the total value locked of different blockchains so that's on the right column of course ethereum is leading the pack with 45 billion Solana is at number three Tron by the way at number two but a lot of that value is very likely artificial feel free to check out the Tron videos on this channel but what's actually interesting is to see the correlation across crypto right so when there's money flowing out when people are getting risk off then you're getting destroyed pretty much on any metric and Solana did have a very nice ride since December of 2022 so what we've got over here is the Solana dominance how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap is in so and this went from half a perent all all the way to more than 3% but again have a look at this over the very long term how much upside do we still have compared to the potential downside it appears that just from this chart the air might be getting thin now here's a very similar chart this is Solana relative to ethereum so the Solana price divided by the ethereum price again we have seen all-time highs just recently but in case we enter a bare Market which of course is no certainty but just in case there is a real chance that Solana gets crushed yet again I mean just have a look at the magnitude of the swings this is the total value locked off Solana over time this used to be at 65 million so tokens but then went down all the way to 10 million now if this wasn't already bad enough the Solana price during the time also went down so when we look at the total value locked measured in us that went from 10 billion all the way to 210 million so that's 2% of the total value locked a value distraction of 98% within a single year and yes this did change recently but the question is for how long can this total value locked stay so high because here is how defi works there's basically two kinds of players there's the people that actively swap they want to get on on the newest meme coin that want to make money as meme coins rise and there are the people that simply allocate Capital that want to earn money with the swapping fees so if you deploy your Capital to a decentralized exchange you deploy your Capital to a liquidity pool and then a lot of people swap within that liquidity pool when there's a lot of trading volume then the people that deployed the capital get a lot of return if there's not a lot of swapping going on then also those Capital providers are likely going to withdraw their capital and here's the thing have a look at the following two charts on the left side we see the decentralized exchange trading volume on Solana each and every week and this peaked in July of this year so that's over here on this chart when also Solana's dominance peaked and it's since then declining quite rapidly what we see on the right side is the liquidity that's deployed so the liquidity did not decline as quickly as the trading volume in other words there's more Capital now competing for the same amount of trading fees which thus means that the average return that a liquidity provider gets also went down quite a lot so if the trading volume stays low then very likely the liquidity will follow as well people will withdraw their liquidity because if you now deploy for example to the slurf so pool or you deploy to the bomb so pool or to the dog with Head Pool Etc you get the point you only get an annualized return of somewhere around 6% potentially less if you're not an active Trader right if you simply just want to get returns are you willing to keep half of your money into a meme coin if you only get 6% per enm for that the answer is clearly no because there's also risk involved in all of this right there's the risk of a decentralized exchange getting hacked there's also the risk of impermanent loss when the two assets diverge too much from one another there's all kinds of risks that need to get compensated 6% per enm does not cut it the trading volume might continue to go down the total value locked will go down with it as people withdraw their slur s in their book of meme so Etc from the decentralized exchanges the total value locked will decrease the price of Solana relative to other cryptocurrencies is likely going to come down as well and once the negative momentum started then things can become ugly very quickly right here's the underperformance of so relative to ethereum by 86% and here's the underperformance of so dominance as a part of all of crypto minus 86% and of course measured in US Dollars it goes down even more in case crypto so as a whole also goes down I don't have a crystal ball either I do not know where the price is going I'm simply just acting upon risk versus reward I'm not sure how high the reward right now is given that activity is very low and there is already a lot of capital deployed the risk I believe is pretty high that Capital will continue to flow out and thus depress Solana simply take the information in this video as an additional data point I'm not asking you to sell your Solana but I'm personally I simply stay away if it's

going to stretch this answer far far out and I will answer this in the next 20 to 30 minutes no this is of course not what I'm going to do this is the ttw there's no more rare token unlocks and with that the underperformance versus ethereum stopped and with that it now makes sense for the market makers especially binance to pump and potentially dump the token so this is really all you need to know those are the results after my research if you want to get more details feel free to continue watching so we currently at roughly 25 cents and onchain we see 11,000 holders so that's on ethereum now the interesting thing about this onchain data is that we do not see accumulation so this rally over here is not underpinned by people buying on chain what we've got over here is a one month chart and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at current prices $500 worth of the token so that's retail in the middle we've got medium-size retail that's $5,000 minimum and on the right side we've got the Wales they also dumped that's another 10x in minimum holding so $50,000 here are the same kind of charts but simply longterm since launch in August of 2021 and again recently we see rather dumping and so the token inflation can explain why the rare token tended to underperform ethereum because to supply more than 4X and so we saw a dump of more than 95% but who's then saying that this recent rally over here is manipulation is this not maybe fundamentally driven here's the problem with crypto YouTube people promoting becoming dgen or buying 100x coins that's what gives clicks but that's not what's going to bring you forward I refuse to take money from centralized exchanges I refuse to take money from crypto projects I refuse to pump and dump a coin and filling up my pockets in the background I don't do any of this instead I share my knowledge in the form of tutorials in the premium membership so that's content that won't do well on YouTube but that builds up skill over time you can also directly contact me over there you can directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com is the link let's have a look at the fundamentals we can't find a lot of data on the website itself but just for information the rare token is the incentive token of super rare which is an nft trading platform and when a price is appreciating like this in a very short time frame then maybe we should be seeing also some increased usage on the platform right check this out this is a super rare monthly volume it's now at $270,000 and used to be at more than $36 million here's the royalties that get distributed to the holders of the nfts all artists combined got only $9,000 this month so far and that used to be 1.5 million the issue is not necessarily with decreased usage per se as in there are still a lot of active collectors that did decline but definitely not to the same degree the reason why those Revenue numbers are down that much is the collapse of the nft prices which used to be at around 50k and now went all the way down on average to 1.2k so again the number of users didn't drink that much the number of traded nfts also didn't shrink that much but when the revenue is declining that heavily because of all of the nfts collapsing then why is the rare token going up because now binance does not have to worry anymore that Partners investors super rare Labs Etc is going to dump on them they don't get any token unlocks anymore and so that's then what we also see on chain the majority of spot trading volume happens on binance more than half of the trading volume in total and on top of that we've got a ton of manipulation through the Perpetual Futures Market in the last 24 hours we have seen $1.5 billion worth of the token that changed hands probably via wash trading on binance and so if you're considering to buy the rare token right now at least be aware that it's the strongest players in the market the most experienced players in the market namely the centralized exchanges that you're competing against I'm not saying that the price can't Rally from here I'm not saying that it has to collapse tomorrow but but I am saying that this recent rally was very likely not fundamentally driven but simply just a pump and dump some manipulation by people within binance probably if you got something out of this data feel Fe to

data try to figure out what are the buyers and sellers doing let's have a look at the news as well because here's a simple solution to the puzzle the peanut token got listed on binance and it's not just peanut it's also the ACT token I just published a video on act a few hours ago and so yes everything is green right now but the best performers in the last week where act and peanut and so peanut is now the fourth largest trending token on Solana when measured by the liquidity pool size we're now at 10.6 million and so how much longer can this rally actually last this is not the first video on Peanut on this channel I published one 6 days ago and it already outperformed a typical video from the beginning with the secondary rally we've seen another search of interest and so that initial video was published when we were still at 11 cents now we are at 47 cents and so I try to be early on this channel I publish videos on various meme coins regularly feel free to subscribe to not miss the next one feel free to potentially even hit the notification Bell again to be early now here's a common misconception most people think that the altcoins are actually currently outperforming everything else that's not true though Bitcoin tends to do better than most alt coins if you currently hold a defi project if you currently hold a gaming token your probably not that well off because have a look at this this is the others dominance this shows the share of all the altcoins that are not in the top 10 and since beginning of the year this went down roughly from 13.4% to 99.4% a reduction in relevance of 29% relatively speaking now there is a category that does outperform everything else and that's the Elon Musk related tokens with the election of trump but also the pump fun ecosystem so launch pad on Solana for mem coins so this is the category stab on coin gecko the best performing category in the last seven days was Elon Musk inspired tokens the second best was pump. fun now within the pump fun ecosystem we've got a few tokens that do better than others now Goos Maximus the largest of the pump fun ecosystem tokens did pretty well but have a look at those two right this is act and this is Peanut the listings on binance really do move the needle and what this also means is that binance is totally willing to list pump fun launch tokens and I think that's a very bullish sign because this shows us that there is some potential when we buy a pump fund token that's maybe only 10 million in market cap when it goes up to 50 million or 100 million that then there's another Boost from a listing this does long-term improve the risk to reward of mem coin trading from pump fun now let's go back to peanut and let's have a look at the onchain analytics one more time we are now at 54 4,000 holders on the Solana chain and on Twitter we've got 23,000 followers so somewhat the same order of magnitude on telegram we've got 14,000 members 3,600 being active so all of this makes sense not too much manipulation here now when we just look at the buyers and sellers today right we up 35% we actually see that this recent rally is driven by a few whales there's less buyers today than sellers but the buyer tend to buy more than the sellers sell despite the price having already gone up that much again that's a sign that the smart money is buying now what we've got over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus new Traders over time and the number of transactions over time we can see that the binance listing also attracted quite a few new first-time Traders now we can ignore the very last data point because the 12th of November isn't yet over at the same time despite the first time Traders peing we don't necessarily see the number of token trend transactions peing the trading volume though did spike it went to an all-time high and small retail didn't really do that much relatively speaking but the growth from the 3rd of November to the 11th of November was maybe 50% at maximum the trading volume by large retail more than doubled and so what we see on the left side measured in US dollars is normalized to 100% for this chart on the right again small retail recently tends to trade less now it appears the following has happened here it looks like the Wales did some automated trading to very quickly buy upon the binance listing so for example there are some Bots that carry the binance API regularly that check for new listings and whenever there's a new listings they buar up the token very very quickly on Solana to then afterwards send it over to binance to sell it there so what you actually see on the Solana chain is a reduction of the number of holders across the board and the reduction is the largest for the whale now what we see here is the number of retail investors on the left so wallets that have at least 2,000 peanut tokens this did go down with the listing as well but not by much maybe by 20% a bit less than that mediumsized retail with 20,000 Holdings or roughly $10,000 worth of the token went down by a third and the number of whale wallets went down to a similar degree and so look at that development over time the wallets that have at least $100,000 worth of the token now hold a lot of the supply to be specific 83% and of course in there is also the binance wallet meanwhile the share of tokens that are held by small retail continues to decline the same is true for mediumsized retail and even for the large retail crowd so for the wallet that have less than $100,000 worth of the token the listing did attract new attention it did attract of course a price rise but also new holders on chain something we've already seen the number of new Traders increased but what I think is going to happen now is that binance continues to accumulate more and more of the token and there going to set the direction of the token because not all of the tokens that binance holds are onetoone custody by customers they of course also hold tokens just to move the price or for Market making and so very likely we're going to see increased volatility at least relatively speaking to the market cap for peanut it does not make sense in my opinion to set any stop losses because the way centralized exchanges make money is with volatility right when the price moves a lot there's a lot of trading volume as well and the centralized exchanges make money with trading volume Now peanut has a market cap of half a billion right now of 500 million most gains are of course made when the tokens are still small and how can we find tokens when they are still small how can we find what to potentially buy I personally do this with wallet tracking so for example over here we see that crypto benter bought the peanut token on the third of November for 3 cents currently we are at 48 cents so we are up 1,000 400% since then here's the Crypt Channel they've got more than a million subscribers that can definitely move markets and since the blockchain is transparent when we know the wallet of somebody which we can find out through various techniques we can then also track whenever they buy and sell we've got now 33 wallets by Crypt bter alone so that's all part of premium in total we track more than 400 wallets and so here I recently got feedback by one of our new joiners he says that the group is worth it and that that the price is Justified but yeah I really believe in wallet tracking I even made a dedicated tutorial section just on that there are eight dedicated videos on how to find influencer wallets how to then afterwards track them and how to then subsequently interpret the signals that we get from the tracking so that's over here on the website of premium in tutorials there's a subsection wallet Discovery here are those eight videos but there's more than 100 tutorial videos in premium in total not just on wallet tracking but also on onchain analytics on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification Etc feel free to check it out once we get a signal it makes sense to also look at all the analytics and there are dedicated chats in telegram for the individual alt coin so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first seven days and I'll will refund you 100% And so yes I do believe that peanut can go higher because now binance does a lot of the market making I do believe though at the same time that the volatility is likely going to increase the most upside I think is in the smaller pump fun ecosystem tokens the ones that are bought by the Insiders early if you got some value on this video If you you to subscribe I publish this regly a like would

week where nothing is happening in crypto there's one token that's standing out and that's Renda Renda performed the best in the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the last week let's have a look what's driving this let's see who's buying and selling this let's see who's driving the price here because in order to make any kind of price prediction we need to know is this currently manipulation is this currently natural demand what's actually the potential upside so have a look at the table behind me this is the top one 100 cryptocurrencies render is at number one when ordered by the top performance in the last 7 days and so that's plus 37% this week plus 470 this month and since listing on coin market cap in the middle of 2020 we went from 5 cents all the way to more than $10 now an increase of more than 26,000 per. now there had been our ups and downs and so let's have a look at what potentially caused those movements to the down side and what matters most is of course relative valuation because when Bitcoin and ethereum goes down then render is likely going to go down as well so let's have a look at how is render actually doing relative to ethereum for example check out this chart this starts in November of 2021 and first render did not do that well render relative to ethereum dropped by more than 80% so have a look at this this is how you search for this in trading view you enter render usd/ us DT so we get the relative variation to e but then something happened then we recovered similar to the levels one year ago and then you see here this vertical line something specific happened here as well that vertical line indicates when the token inflation for render massively declin that's always the problem with altcoins right altcoins in general tend to be very inflationary a lot of new tokens get printed that then gets allocated to early investors and to the team Etc they might then sell some of those tokens but potentially depressing the price but since that vertical line that doesn't happen anymore or let's say it happens to a smaller degree because this is the middle of June 2023 and check this out this is the number of circulating render tokens over time and this here is the middle of June 2023 so the token inflation massively went down there isn't that much new render hitting the market anymore but check this out check out the end of 2021 that's the beginning of this chart right this is when we saw the massive dump so an increase in the supply leads to a decrease in the price at least relatively speaking to other cryptocurrencies relative to ethereum and so that's a positive sign right since at vertical line the token inflation went down and since then Renda was able to outperform potentially continuing as the project gets developed further and gets more and more adoption now let's have a look who's driving those kind of prices is this retail buying in or is this the Wales potentially manipulating the price what's happening let's have a look at onchain data most people aren't considering there are two tokens of render that have some kind of adoption one is on ethereum one is on polygon let's look at both this is the ethereum based token and let's check out the largest holders the very first holder is a contract address that has now 27% of the entire Supply and that tends to reduce in its balance so it went from 225 million tokens to now 143 million tokens so this is probably a location to the team Etc this is expected to continue to go down but then let's have a look at those labeled wallets right the bridges Etc aren't really that interesting let's have a look at binance and at okx here's the balance of the binance wallet over time so binance is accumulating either for their own Market making or simply for custody because a lot of customers might potentially buy this on the platform and then binance has to hatch itself against this right it has to buy them directly on chain so this could be an expression of customer demand on the binance platform this is actually what I expect this to be have a look at this chart this is the balance on okx very similar a very constant increase with the only difference that the rebalance seems to be happening a bit more frequently but let's dive into this a bit more deeper let's look at the number of whale wallets let's have a look at the number of retail wallets are there more more retail investors jumping on this are there more and more whale investors jumping on this what's actually happening so according to Ether scan we've got 91,000 holders of render on chain but when we split this up by minimum holding thresholds so when we say we only want to count the wallets that have at least 100 render tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 then instead of 91,000 holders we've got less than half of that 40,000 holders roughly so that's the number of retail investors here on the left minimum holding 100 tokens in the middle we've got a minimum holding of a th000 token so a 10x from the left chart that's now medium-sized retail also growing quite nicely over time they roughly 10,000 such Wallets on the right side we go another 10x from that that's in holding of $100,000 we've got more than a, such wallets in render also long-term quite constant accumulation let's have a look at the second version of the token this is now on polygon there's 22,000 holders overall but there's only 2,500 holders over 100 tokens 277 holders over 1,000 tokens and very very few whales only 21 even though roughly a fifth of all holders are on polygon most of the capital clearly is on ethereum not on polygon now what happened in the last month where we simply went sideways right in the last week we did pretty well but in the last month not much has happened for the render token here are the same kind of charts on the ethereum Chain just for the last month a lot of accumulation by retail or let's rather say constant accumulation not necessarily A Lot maybe an increase of 5% or so mediumsized retail also grew the whales also grew but with a bit more volatility they sold at the beginning of the month bought at the second half of the month similar to how the price is also moving so the Wales really have quite a bit of impact on the price there is some kind of limit to that analysis and again because a lot of the trading for render already happens on the centralized exchanges most of the trading happens on binance then comes coinbase then comes gate.io still to me it appears said this is not manipulation it looks like people are buying into render both retail as well as Wales this seems to be a relatively stable price development however there is a bit of a risk here and that risk is not specific to render it's related to the altcoin market as a whole I talked about this with the premium members for quite a while now and I want to share this now on YouTube as well have a look at the stablecoin market cap it tended to expand for quite a while and the lacoin market cap does have some correlation to crypto prices it tends to not expand anymore for the last 2 to three weeks so there's no more money flowing into crypto right now if we don't see more money flowing into crypto then maybe the accumulation of render tokens will also slow down and when that slows down and the whales sell because there isn't no more fresh Capital entering then of course the US dollar price of render might go down as well but still in the overall Market I believe render is rather one of the better picks still the altcoin market as a whole is somewhat in a limbo right now at least in my opinion if it's your first time here feel you to subscribe I publish you regularly like would be very much appreciated as

Giga Tokenomics,  #gigachad #giga #crypto","two month ago I published a video on Giga chat and initially nobody was really interested in the token I'm wondering if this changes for this video because check this out the average video is here in Gray and the gigachad video tended to underperform quite a bit and very often the reason for such underperformance is that the token isn't yet well known in other words we are still early once we aren't that early anymore and a lot of people search for a token that's when the YouTube algorithm SP spreads the video everywhere so we're actually not really as YouTubers incentivized to talk about to early projects unfortunately so at the time the price was at 2.1 cents roughly since then we more than doubled so if you don't want to miss the next video feel free to subscribe I published videos regularly on this channel now here's what's so nice about the Giga chat token it's still mainly been traded in a decentralized fashion most trading happens on radium directly on the Solana chain and because of that onchain data tends to be very reliable we don't have those black boxes where binance is dominating 90% of trading that's not here for the Giga chat token so check this out this is the Solana chain and we look at the trending tokens ordered by liquidity and the gigachad token is already at number six it's got $2 million worth of liquidity while the market cap is 400 million roughly now we're going to make a market cap comparison in a second but let's first look at who's actually supporting this R who's buying who's selling here I've got a tool that displays just that so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 20,000 Gat tokens at the current price that's $900 worth of the token in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $9,000 worth of the token for the right side we got another 10x from that so $90,000 worth of the token what we see is that the Wales sniped the token very early and then dumped half of their holding and they then subsequently roughly doubled in number again we see a similar initial dump for small retail and medium-sized retail but we see how the growth subsequently was larger we see how small retail grew by roughly 10x in number of wallets and mediumsized Retail grew by roughly 4 to 5x so it looks like the price action of the Giga token is mainly driven by retail retail is accumulating the fastest we have accumulation across the board but it's really retail that's buying up most and so we can see this effect especially in the the last few days what we've got over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on any given day and when the number of firsttime Traders is relatively large compared to the recurring Traders as happened on the 4th 5ifth and 6th of October that's when the price tends to make Sustainable New highs so here's the 4th of October this is where the rally really started now today is the 7th of October and so this data isn't yet complete so we can ignore this but we definitely have to watch this going forward if the number of first-time Traders declines then the price might not be that stable anymore let's have a look at trading volume it seems like the number of small retail investors is growing the fastest however the trading volume tends to get dominated more and more by the larger players so we're now splitting up the trading volume across whales large retail mediumsized retail and small retail small is the wallets below $11,000 medium is the wallets below $110,000 large is below 100,000 and Wales is above 100,000 let's just look at small retail what we can see that over time this tends to decline in other words the whales are buying up more and more of the token probably because the retail growth is just so constant now what's the potential upside here let's compare market caps so what you've got over here are various meme coins gigga chat is currently at 450 million roughly and if we were to double we would flip Brett but still be below popcat if we were to Triple we would rival the popcat market cap and everything above that is probably not too realistic because then we're looking at flocky Bon dock with head so it's not going to be that easy for the price at least relatively speaking to the rest of the mcoin market to quad dropel or to maybe even 10x at a 10x it would be larger than dog with head and so 50 cents per gig chat or $1 per gig chat is probably not going to happen 10 cents is definitely in the realm of possibility but that's probably also very much dependent on how much additional centralized exchange trading we will see over time this YouTube yoube channel has a premium community and in that Community we discuss meme coins very early for example we started a discussion on Nero on the 3D of August and the price since then went up by more than 30,000. now not every meme coin is exploding like this but it shows how important asset selection is right if there's 10 tokens and nine of them go to zero but one of them makes a 30,000 per return that's fine so it is a bit like buying lottery tickets but it's not completely random right we can follow other INF fencers we can see what they are buying and selling which we by the way also do in premium and of course we can use onchain data all the charts that we've seen in this video are part of a tool that are also part of Premium you can plug in any token into this tool any ethereum token any Solana token and we can then discuss in the chats where all those firsttime Traders are coming from and how much longer this can potentially last if your portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram the link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting with you over there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO-WQXc-RII,"['Ethereum', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'Gigachad', 'WHY', 'MCOIN',

Cryptocurrency, Shrub Analysis, Shrub Review, Shrub Price, Shrub Price Prediction, Shrub longterm, Shrub Tokenomics,  #shrub #memecoin #crypto","it is memec coin season unless you've been living under a rock you know now that memec coins outperform pretty much everything else in crypto right now and one of the meme coins is doing the best and that is shrp have a look at this table this is an overview of meme coins and it's ordered by the performance in the last s days SHP is at number one and unfortunately I did not buy even though I got a direct message from one of our premium members I reacted too late to this but have a look at this this is Rafal he messaged me about TR more than one week ago and so the big question is how much longer can this really now last we have seen quite a bit of a dip does it make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people aren't looking at now there's actually quite a bit of a misconception most people think that the altcoins in general are currently doing pretty well but that can't be further from the truth check this out this is the others dominance so this is how much market cap of all of crypto is currently in the alt coins that are not in the top 10 and this went down since beginning of the year by 28% really the market is now segregating into two segments on the one hand we've got the Bitcoin investor that simply just wants to get exposure to crypto that might want to diversify away from property and from stocks and then on the other hand there are the active Traders the people that are okay with the risk of crypto but that also want to get the upside the 10x maybe the 100x upsides and so that then explains why the best performing categories within crypto are all memec coin related despite the overall altcoin Market not doing that well the middle is simply just shrinking the def5 protocols the game five protocols the infrastructure place they are all bleeding against Bitcoin and so yes I do believe that Bitcoin dominance is going to increase but I also believe that the mem coin trading is likely going to continue the question is does it make sense then to buy shr now this is where we are right now the price is at 14.7 and after a massive rally we have seen a correction of 43% roughly now here's a data point I always like to look at I like to look at what is causing the current decline in the last 24 hours and we can see this data very clearly on Deck screener we can see the number of buyers versus the number of Sellers and at the same time we can see the buying volume versus the selling volume now what this here indicates is that since there are more buyers than Sellers and since the buying volume isn't as high that it's the larger wallets that are currently selling and that it's small wallets that are buying in in other words that's probably still profit taking from this initial run in the last 10 days we still after this crash went up by more than 3,000% and so to find out whether or not makes sense to buy the shr token now we can't just look at the website right the website is something everybody looks at we want to get an edge in the market we want to look at the data most people do not have access to that's why we look deeper into the blockchain now before we look at the analytics I always like to make a first pre-check and that is are potentially the social analytics manipulated so let's compare the numbers on on the xplatform formerly Twitter we've got roughly 4,000 followers on telegram we've got 6,000 members and on chain we've got a bit over 7,000 holders so all those numbers somewhat align it makes sense it's not like the Twitter account has 10 times the number of holders on chain so this seems to be all legitimate now let's go into the onchain data and there is a first surprise what we see over here is the number of small retail investors versus the number of large whale investors so the way this is segregated is by minimum holding thresholds so the Wallets on the left have at least 7,000 sh tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we've got 1,000 token so that's not $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got $100,000 worth of the token now of course it does make sense that the price increase aligns with the number of holders but there is something funny here right the number of retail investors roughly tripled in the last few days the number of medium-sized retail investors roughly doubled but check out the whales the whales also increased in the first run but they didn't move whatsoever in the second run so what we see over here are alltime charts this is when the token started trading what we see over here are the exact same kind of thresholds but only for the last month and again we can see very clearly quite a lot of growth by small investors a bit less growth by mediumsized and zero growth in the number of whale wallets when did the second rally start it was on the 10th of November so let's look at the long-term logarithmic chart again the 10th of November was over here so what seems to have happened is that all wallet cohorts bought into this first R especially the Wales the second wave though the second runup was not supported by the Wales and they might be the ones that are currently taking profit they might be the reason why we are down by more than 40% now we can see those two waves also very nicely in the following charts on the left side we see the number of buyers and sellers per day on the right side that's normalized to 100% per day and so this was the initial token launch this is when a lot of the Wales bought in and this is now when retail joined the party and when the whales tend to potentially offload now the ratio between buyers and sellers hasn't really changed that much it slightly now skews more towards the buyers which kind of makes sense right there is a buyer overhang but not that much of a price increase because the sellers move more Capital than the buyers do now I always like to look at the number of new users as well at the number of new users versus recurring users for a specific token because if more people adopt a token then the whales are unlikely going to sell as well the price action is dictated by the Wales but they definitely follow what retail is doing as well if retail continues to buy they keep on holding now on the left side we see the number of new users over time we've got our first rally on the 3rd of November and then we've got our buildup by retail now the problem is that that buildup seems to be slowing down a bit so on the 15th and on the 16th we have seen less buyers we can also see that on those two days the number of returning users outpace the number of new users on the day with a lot of new Adoption on that 14th of November M we almost saw a flippening happening as in more new users than returning users trading the token on a day now not everything is bad for the shr token because even though the whales tend to not buy anymore and the retail demand is somewhat slowing down there is still quite a bit of upside because have a look at this table this is the trending tokens on the ethereum Chain ordered by liquidity and we can't find shrub that quickly we have to scroll quite a bit down to find it it's at place number 32 it's got a liquidity of 2.6 million so we could easily do another 2x 3x maybe even 4X and we would then be at levels of liquidity similar to SPX or pipcoin or wck now the art in crypto is to be early right to not be the exit liquidity of others it's to find tokens before they Trend and we all know how the mem coins are now the most trending category for example over here the pump fun ecosystem this is the launch pad of meme coins on Solana over here we've got the peanut token which went up by a000 700% and is now at a market cap of 1.6 billion the upside potential for a token at 1.6 billion is of course not the same compared to when it's just at 100 million how was I able to publish a video on Peanut that early so that was more than 10 days ago and initially nobody was interested only after the price ried people watched the video at the time we are still at 11 cents and now even after the recent correction we are still at $1.70 the answer to those questions is wallet tracking I like to track other influencers I like to track other top Traders I like to track people that move markets and the nice thing about the blockchain is that transactions are transparent when you know who owns what wallet you also know who buys and sells what at what time for example check out this alert Crypt Benta bought the peanut token at only 3 cents so that was over here since then the price went up by more than 5,000% now who is Crypt bter crypt bter is one of the largest crypto channels in of YouTube so here's the page Crypt vent has 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token of course the token goes up and the alpha in all of this is to actually find those wallets that's the hard part and so we are tracking 33 of Crypt bent's wallets and so this is I believe a way better strategy than to simply just pick random meme coins in a list it's to actually follow the people that tended to make the right calls in the past it's to follow the Insiders to follow the people that actually move markets I believe in the strategy that much that I've made a dedicated tutorial section just on that topic so here are eight videos on how to find influencer wallets how to track influencer wallets and how to then interpret the signals that we get from the tracking now this is all part of Premium premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at at the beginning of this video it's also about risk mitigation it's also about back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total for premium now once we've got a wallet signal we also need to discuss when to buy when to sell that's why there are dedicated altcoin Chats on the individual altcoins in premium as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a one week money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it still make sense to buy shr yes there is some upside potential but on the other hand I also see a lot of wals that are currently dumping and I don't know how much longer they will dump if we see again another wave of retail investors they probably continue to take profit I think there are better more natural rallies out there that don't have that much whale ownership if you got some value out video feel free to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEpKAnDRW0k,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'Scroll', 'WHY',

who's driving this who's buying here is this the big Wales or is this small retail is this manipulation by the centralized exchanges what's happening here this is the rally I'm talking about we are currently at $761 and just have a look at how this accelerated in the last few days this is massive now why was this unexpected because of this chart over here this is the token unlocks of the wld token over time and we are currently at 1.1 billion tokens roughly and one year from now this will be 3 billion the supply of worldcoin will almost 3x in a single year that's why so many people were bearish on this you need a lot of demand in order to offset that additional Supply just to keep the price stable this is a very very aggressive unlock schedule and now let's have a look at the following here this is the number of weekly new accounts of worldcoin those are onchain metrics and this seems to have pretty much died we are once at 50,000 new accounts every week now we are at less than 100 so what's causing this really one potential explanation is this over here this is the number of minted worldcoin nfts and this is going in waves but each wave is larger than the last one I have a look at this this is again onchain this is the circulating apply over time again according to June and this looks very different to the unlock schedule on token. unlocks do app now there's two possible explanations for this either this unlock schedule isn't real and it assumes adoption as in new people scanning their irises or the numbers here are not accurate and the crashes that we see in this Supply chart could be simply bridges over to optimism because now wld is not just available on ethereum but also on the cheaper optimism now when we invest into an altcoin we we want to see outperformance right otherwise we could simply just invest into Bitcoin or ethereum so let's have a look at how did worldcoin perform relative to ethereum over the long term so we're not just looking at the US dollar chart we're looking at the chart divided by the ethereum price and so that's this one over here it's interesting how those two bottoms and those two tops align pretty much and how we have broken out of the resistance here since the end of July of last year to today worldcoin has outperformed ethereum by 127% roughly so in this case taking on more risk was really worth it now is this manipulation is this manipulation by the centralized exchanges that buy up the token because maybe too many people are shorting this the answer is behind me we do have quite a bit of trading volume in the last 24 hours on binance and on okx but the magnitude isn't yet that massive it's roughly half a billion and the market cap is already at 1 billion to see manipulation we'd usually see a multiple of the market cap trading every day on those centralized exchanges this is not what we're seeing here another thing to look out for are the perpetuals is there too much trading volume on those is there too much leverage in the market again the answer is no yes there's quite a bit of movement on binance and okx but the funding rates are very close to zero if we were to see massive funding rates in either direction then this could be manipulation yet again right because then it would be worth it for binance to push up the price or to lower the price because then it could benefit from the liquidation fees but if this is pretty much neutral if people aren't massively net long or net short and the funding rates are very close to zero then maybe this R is somewhat natural but let's have a look at that natural demand let's have a look at onchain statistics and let's see who is buying here is this the big Wales or is this small retail who's driving that price R to answer this I have built a tool that I make available to the premium members so you can pluck in any ethereum token you can pluck in any optimism token and you can look at retail versus the Wales so that's down below that's the bitcoin.com it's also in the pinned comments and on the left side we see the number of Wallets on ethereum that hold at least 100 wld tokens the current price at $774 this is what I'd consider on the ethereum Chain small retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail this is now a 10x from the left chart this is now $77,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales this is now $70,000 worth of the token there's long-term accumulation across the board but since those are very long-term charts starting in July let's look at the same in the last month where this massive rally occurred small retail went up massively mediumsized retail also went up more consistently they bought a bit earlier and the big whales aren't really changing in number that much but isn't that interesting the people that tend to have more money they bought in earlier than the small retail in other words the people that have more Capital they tend to make also the better calls we see this time and time again crypto is a game both of luck but also of skill and the more often you play the game the more the skill component will shine through meaning that people that already have large pockets they tend to make the better calls that's why it makes a lot of sense to look at the whales or at least at the medium-sized retail people so yes the number of Mega whales didn't increase but the people with at least $7,000 they purchased quite nicely in this month as well small retail is really getting Bonkers about this rally now I've said that there's two versions of wld right one on ethereum one on optimism this is now only the ethereum numbers but let's have a look at the corresponding optimism numbers as well this is also going up pretty steadily especially the whales continue to accumulate here those are again the long-term charts and here is the last month the number of Wes slightly went up the number of medium-sized retail is pretty much unchanged some people are taking profit and small retail here is going down quite a bit but compare this on ethereum the number of small retail wallets went up by roughly 400 on optimism it went up by roughly 2,000 still very interesting that we see profit taking since the 15th of February and the price definitely did not go down since the 15th of February again two potential explanations either the capital is Flowing now into the nfts OR there is some kind of manipulation by the centralized exchanges it's probably a mixture of both still it's impressive that over the long term there is Broad accumulation by everyone both on ethereum but also on optimism the big big question is what is happening with Supply will the supply further expand if this is your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish

videos tend to outperform average videos in other words there is a lot of retail interest for Dogecoin now does that mean that also the price will go further up from here let's have a look at some data most people are not considering now let me give you an insight into the YouTube statistics here here's a Dogecoin video published 15 days ago and the average video is here in Gray This is normally how an average video per performs and in blue is what that Dogecoin video performed it made 4.7 times more views than an average video another Dogecoin video followed 2.1 times more views and here's another one 3.2 times 2.6 times and 3.3 times and so what's going on with all of that retail interest why are so many people suddenly interested in Doge of course the price of Doge went up but probably the main question everybody's mind is how much higher can Dogecoin get from here because that's the general game with crypto right we Tred to figure out the expected value of a bet we try to find out what's a potential upside but also what's a potential risk and How likely are those two scenarios going to happen thus nobody knows for sure where something will go right nobody can predict prices but we can figure out if currently a bet makes sense or it's rather better to stay away now Dogecoin is the largest of the mem coins in all of crypto and the mcoin market is huge so the market cap of all of Doge is approaching 60 billion and the number two with which is Sheba Eno has only a fourth of that size the newest Joiner in the top 10 is Peanut and that has only 160th of the size when we look at all the meme coins that are listed in coin gecko we've got more than 3,000 tokens of course outside of coin gecko there are tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of meme coins and so Dogecoin is number one how much higher can it potentially go when we simply just compare market caps here are the largest cryptocurrencies overall not just the mcoin market market and there Dogecoin is at number seven let's say we speculate on Dogecoin hitting $1 what would be the market cap it would be 2.5x the current market cap which puts it at 147 billion so even above the largest of the stable coins tether also above Solana only Bitcoin and ethereum would be larger than Doge and so that's definitely a very optimistic scenario right I'm not saying it cannot happen but I do think that simply just in terms of outperformance the rest of the market a 2.5x is not that easily achievable now most retail investors they tend to buy an altcoin and then hold it for the very long term hoping that it will appreciate the very large investors the Wales they tend to buy and sell much more actively now let's go back in time let's have a look at many many years ago when Dogecoin just launched how was it at that time relative to other cryptocurrencies there's a very interesting website and that is coinmarketcap.com slh hisorical on that website we can see the crypto rankings at different points in time it starts in 2013 and of course goes all the way to today and this is a very nice reminder of History let's go to the beginning of Doge in December of 2013 this is how the top 100 looked at that point in time no surprise of course Bitcoin is at number one there is a bit of a surprise Litecoin is at number two ethereum wasn't yet around and where do we have Dogecoin we've got Dogecoin at number 15 so relatively speaking Dogecoin climbed up the ladder again now it's at number seven but here is I believe a very important takeaway from this table just have a look at those names over here how many of those names do you actually recognize do you still recognize NXT or namecoin or quar or bitshares the worldcoin is not the world coin we know today this is another world coin we've got mega coin Prime coin infinite coin feathercoin and yes we do have here our Dogecoin but just have a look at this list right you probably don't remember a lot of those kinds of cryptocurrencies 90% 95% maybe even more got completely forgotten and so this tells us that maybe buying and holding a cryptocurrency over many many years an altcoin not necessarily Bitcoin but an altcoin over many many years is a very risky Endeavor but then there's the counterargument and that counterargument is over here right this is Dogecoin over the very long term if you bet on the right token of course you can make nice money let's have a look at the chart in logarithmic form since launch Dogecoin went up by 178,000 per. at the same time though Bitcoin also went up so the question is did we get enough outperformance to compensate for say 90% of losers or maybe even 95% of losers what we have got over here is again this long-term chart but this time we divide the do price price by the Bitcoin price so we look at the long-term outperformance relative to bitcoin how much more performance it we get by buying Dogecoin compared to just buying Bitcoin and the answer is over here the outperformance is 1,100% a 10x a bit more than that and that happened with a lot of volatility right we tend to be trading in somewhat of a range and now we are somewhere in the middle of the upper range here it is interesting how those bottoms align quite nicely here right it seems like there's some kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy effect maybe enough people are watching charts like this but then again right let's work with this bullish case let's say we hit the upper bound of that trading range that would be an appreciation of 170% or the magical 2.5x roughly that we already talked about that's probably not hyper likely at least longterm could we get there a day or two potentially is it worth the risk I'm not sure it seems like most of the time when we show shot up that quickly as we have recently we tended to rather trickle downward subsequently now here's another way to look at this this is the Dogecoin dominance so dominance simply just looks at how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap the entire cryptocurrency space is now tied up in Doge or another way to phrase this how important is Dogecoin relative to all of crypto right now and unfortunately this chart doesn't go that far back into the past but still we are now at very similar levels to what we had seen in October of 22 and the best case upside is maybe plus 100% a bit more than that since that recent rally even though the Dogecoin price went up it did not outperform since the 13th of November now the crypto Market as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly and I like to look at the stable coin market cap to determine whether or not we're currently in the bull market or in a bare market and that is the chart we see over here sometimes we see the stable coin market cap going up sometimes we see it going down and the reason why I like this chart so much is because it has very little volatility right it doesn't go tically up and down like the Bitcoin price or like the Dogecoin price it has very clear Trends what happened over here was the defi collapse of the anchor protocol right so this is when Terra Luna went bus this is when the US stable coin depack this is when a lot of people withdrew money from crypto it started a whole Bare market and during that bare Market Bitcoin went from 69k all the way down to 16k and also FTX collapsed during that bare Market since October of last year we see an expansion of the stablecoin market cap again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the reason why this chart is so useful is not just because we can see clearly the trend where currently the crypto Market is at what's also nice about it is that we can deterministically say that currently money is flowing into crypto as in traditional Finance the traditional Finance world is moving Fiat into the crypto space because whenever this is going up this means that you send for example your US dollars to binance and binance then sends this to a custodian of stable coins let's say tether tether then takes custody of your money right it puts it in some kind of bank account or in some kind of bonds and then mins the tokens on the blockchain and we can see the tether minting here in this chart and so the exact opposite happens when this is going down this is when you withdraw your fiat currency from binance and so I think there's roughly 177 billion reasons to believe that the price of crypto is likely going to continue to rise from here all of crypto and so this is what I mean with all of crypto right crypto is highly correlated to one another when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well but they don't go up to the same degree here are the top 100 alt coins in the last 7 Days ordered by their performance and the best performer was Stella with a bit over 100% but have a look at this this is the best performing meme coins in the last s days and we've got chill guy with more than 3,000% in the last 7 days we talked about chill guy several times on this channel but we also talked about the goat token several times on this channel when it was still very very cheap now goat is the largest of the meme coins on the Solana blockchain that had been launched with pump. fun so pump. fun is the Launchpad of meme coins on Solana there's a lot of trading happening over there and goat has the largest market cap now I made a video on Goat when it was still at 24 cents that was on the 16th of October subsequently the price went up by more than 500% now recently it came down again a bit and so I try to find tokens that currently have positive momentum that still have a lot of upside potential tokens that can still do the 3 four five xes that are probably not possible anymore with the larger tokens so if you're interested in being early in those kind of bets then feel fre you to subscribe to this channel right I publish videos regularly here now how did I find out about the go token for example that early the answer is wallet tracking have a look at this influencer Kyle Chessie bought the gold token already at 14 cents so that was over here subsequently the price went up by more than 800% now what is wallet tracking the blockchain is completely transparent right we can see who's buying who's selling the only difficult part is to find out what are the wallets that are important who owns what kind of wallets what kind of wallets actually make money and so here is Kyle chesse he's got more than 130,000 subscribers he's the person that bought gold early and so through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets we always get a signal when he's buying or selling something I have a look at this alert from today bankless bought the clanker token for $53 since then the price went up by 57% again that's in a matter of a few hours and have a look at this below right this is the onchain analytics that one of our moderators performed on The Token here's the bankless channel they've got almost a quarter of a million subscribers and of course when they talk about a token this generates a lot of attention and attention then means purchases and purchases mean a rising price we only have two of Bank L's wallets but we try to find more again we use onch analytics and we have our people in the chats that use various methods to find wallets of people that move markets I want to share one more trade and it's probably the most impressive of the trades because it turns a micro cap into a pretty large pump and dump this was on November 23rd the martini guy bought the moon token on pump fun right we already talked about pump. fun and he did this at a price of 412 this is how that developed once it got traded on radium it red up by more than 1,000% now it's at 4 34 so even after the dump we are still up by roughly 3x that's how early those kind of signals are here is the martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers roughly and here are the wallets that we Track by this guy 12 in total we now have exactly 500 wallets in our tracking so it's not just the three influencers that I just mentioned we've got way more and so this is I believe the real way to make money in crypto right you want to know things that most people don't know how else can you buy lower than others and sell higher than others if you don't have a market Edge if you don't know more than others it's better to be very closely to the people that buy early and then potentially sell when all the masses come and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it is eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to set up the tracking for the influencer wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell what are the current onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month the price will increase next week so you can lock in still this old price and keep that old price there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you do not like premium just message me within the first first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so it does it make sense to keep on holding Dogecoin potentially right the overall crypto Market is expanding so the US dollar price of Doge is likely going to go up as well will it continue to outperform bitcoin I'm not so sure I think the best risk to reward is now in other place it's especially in the smaller meme coins if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I probably youly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

ecosystem is there still upside potential who's buying here who's selling here what's currently driving the price let's have a look at some data most people are not considering so here has peanut in the pump. fun ecosystem it's got double the size of chill guy which is a quite trending token recently it's three times the size of mudang and fcoin we see that in general the pump fun ecosystem had a pretty rough week most tokens went down but it appears as if the price is now stabilizing somewhat for peanut is the $1 $110 somewhat of a floor and can we only go up from here now this is not the first video on Peanut on this channel I've actually published quite a few the very first video was published 24 days ago and initially not a lot of people were interested but then as the price Rose also the interest Rose and so here is that very first video at the time we were still at 11 cents and since then we went up by 10x even after this recent correction so if you want to be early with mem coins next time feel free to subscribe to this channel I try to pick meme coins that are in positive Trends but that still have some upside potential left and so again this was the first video on Peanut it made 85% more views than the average video the next video got more popular because of course the investor base of peanut grew in the meantime that outperformed 2.4 times the average video the next one even more 5.2 times and it seems like things are slowing down again somewhat the second last video made 1.2 times the number of average views and just the recent video made pretty much the average views a bit at the top end but still it looks like at the beginning nobody was watching then momentum peaked and now we are slowing down somewhat at least and we just look at the retail interest according to the views of on YouTube now in theory how much more upside is there really for Dogecoin let's have a look at the relative market caps in the entire memec coin space so let's go out of pump. fun let's look across all kinds of blockchains the answer is in this table over here the largest of the meme coins has 59 billion in market cap that's Dogecoin and peanut is at 1.1 billion so if peanut was to become the largest meme coin across all chains there would still be a 50x is that realistic I'm not so sure the largest of the mem coins on the Solana chain is Bonk and that's currently at 3.3 billion so that would be a 3X from here everything beyond that is of course a lot of speculation because only with centralized exchange ownership with a lot of Market making can we go beyond that and so let's have a look at the onchain statistics what's happening with the transactions on the Solana chain the buyers and sellers Etc there's currently 68,000 holders on chain but not all of those holders are created equally right some of the wallets might just have a few cents of the token others might have hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of the token now what we see over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring traders in the last month and on the right side we see the number of token transactions in the last month per day and so we can clearly see that at the beginning when the token was launched there was a lot of firsttime Traders the token really expanded its investor base that continued for a while there was a second wave in the middle of this month and since then we are rather trickling down in the number of new Traders again it seems like interest is raning somewhat we also see that in the number of token transactions that peaked on the 3rd of November the number of firsttime users peaked already one day earlier on the 2nd of November we can see the exact same effect when we look at the decentralized exchange trading volume so on the left side that's denominated in US Dollars on the right side that's normalized to 100% per day and we segment here by different wallet cohorts so we've got small retail we've got medium-sized retail we've got large retail and we've got the whales and again we see our two waves of adoption and we see that over time especially medium-sized retail tends to take more and more of the ownership so that's now the wallets that have between ,000 and $10,000 worth of the token small retail tends to decline so does large retail and the Wales and so instead of looking at the trading volume we can also look at the number of holders over time on chain again small retail on the left the whales on the right in the middle something in between so to make that distinction we've got minimum holding thresholds in terms of the number of tokens on the left side that's 1,000 tokens in the middle it's 10,000 tokens on the right it's 100,000 tokens and with the price being close to $1 that equates similar dollar amounts as well and we can see again how the ownership isn't really changing that much in the last few days so really if peanut was to break out now this is probably a move generated by the centralized exchanges or by the market makers because most trading volume happens on binance and on htx white bit is another white labeled version of binance we've also got okx and bitg get that are part of the party but again onchain not much happens and so the price also doesn't move much unless those centralized exchangers want the price to move we see the same picture for the Perpetual Futures market so for the bets the derivative contracts the bets on the price again that's dominated by binance and okx and so it might make sense to rather look at the centralized exchange data than looking at the onchain data so have a look at this this is a funding rate heat map and over here we've got the peanut token and have a look at this the 14th of November we have seen a very high APR it was very expensive to leverage on Rising prices of the peanut token and that data point was over here it was exactly when the price peaked we had another day of high funding rates that didn't do much on the price but it's interesting right the price went down quite a bit so from top to that point in time by 26% and potentially those levered bets and the hedging of those levered bets pushed up the price a little bit so when we are currently in bullish momentum very high funding rates might mean that the centralized exchanges want to depress the price to potentially liquidate some people when we cently not that much in bullish momentum then the centralized exchanges simply just hatch themselves now here's a very interesting recent development you very likely do not have access to this kind of chart this here shows how much advertisers on my YouTube channel pay for 1,000 views of their ads and it's suddenly out of nothing spiked to roughly double of what it used to be in other words crypto projects centralized exchanges Etc they are now competing for advertising space in the crypto scene and it's not just money that's flowing into advertising for crypto there's also simply Fiat money that's flowing into the space as a whole the stable coin market cap tends to rise and it's recently even accelerating so since October of last year we see money flowing into crypto again that of course causes a lot of crypto asset prices to go up and especially in the recent days since beginning of the month we also see the alt coins going up in aggregate so what we have over here is the others dominance this is how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 that went up by roughly 20% in the last month and so pretty much everything is now going up the art in crypto trading though is to buy early right it's to buy when the prices are still low so for example over here the chill guy token it's now at 50 cents but I made a video on chill guy when it was still at 20 cents and I hope a lot of you made money with that video because it was a quite popular one and so this is the real art right we have to get into tokens when momentum is bullish and when there's still enough upside potential and so this is what this channel is all about right it's about discussing tokens that a lot of people don't yet have on their radar so feel free to subscribe now how can I find tokens like chill guy early how can I find things like the go token or the ACT token early those are one of the largest pump. fun ecosystem tokens this is a wallet tracking alert how kle chesse bought the gold token for 14 cents that was over here since then the price went up by more than 500% temporarily it was up by more than 800% who KY chesse it's this influencer over here he's got 137,000 subscribers and he tends to be relatively early on trending tokens and so here is how that works we use onchain analytics again to figure out who is owning what wallet it's not a very easy task but we've got an entire community that just focuses on that single task find wallets that are very useful of insiders of top traders of influencers let's find those wallets and then then track them so over here we've got the wallets that we Track by Kyle chesse we've got 12 in total well let's talk about the ACT token here's our signal for ACT Crypt Benta bought the ACT token at 3.7 now it's at 58 cents so an increase of 1,500% since that signal and of course temporarily the gain was even higher more than 2,000% now where do crazy gains like this come from they come from attention they come from a lot of eyeballs getting into one single token and so here are those eyeballs this is the Crypt banter Channel they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about the token of course the token has to go up and so we've got 33 of Crypt banter wallets and so really I think this is the better approach compared to just drawing random lines on price charts I think it's better to follow the smart money it's better to follow the Insiders it's better to Simply copy trade the people that tend to make money in crypto and I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course just on this how can we find various influencer wallets how can we track those wallets and how can we subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total it's all part of Premium so that's down below the Bitcoin tray.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about portfolio diversification risk management indicator back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we get our wallet signals we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare the onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual all coins as well so feel fore to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything simply just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it make sense to buy the peanut token right now I'm not so sure right because the price action is 100% in the hands of the centralized exchanges and it's all about the upside potential with mem coins right mem coins do not have any inherent value thus we need to get that additional risk compensated but when peanut is already in the hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap and when other meme coins are much much smaller and they've got way more upside potential why not trade those I believe it's much better to buy a meme coin that just gets adoption on chain where there's a lot of new investors flocking in I think it's much more risky to buy a meme coin that's already big and that's mainly in the hands of the market makers that can push the price in any direction they want again I have nothing against peanut right I made a video on Peanut very very early on this channel when the price was still at 11 cents I'm simply just looking at risk versus reward place over here if you got some value on this video feel you to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated here as

Cloud we see that currently the average reward rate is 16.8% so this chart here underestimates the inflation but in theory if we stake poka dot all should be fine right we do not get diluted if there's a bit under 177% dilution why then did porka do underperform ethereum by more than 60% in the last 2 years I think this is related to the staking program so here's the dot over time we've got some staking amount we've got some circulating amount and in the last two years the percent that is staked actually went up this should be positive for the price however we are currently at almost 60% of dot that staked in other words only 40% is floating now if we increase the supply by 177% in a year and that gets at least partially sold off into those 40% liquid Supply then the price impact of that dilution gets levered so here's how that works imagine you had a token where 99% of the tokens gets locked up and then in a year you have 1% additional tokens hitting the market now the liquid Supply in that case doubles right it doubles from the 1% we had before to the 2% we have afterwards and that would then crash the price by 50 50% even though we only have 1% dilution year per year and this is exactly what I believe is going on here there's only 17% dilution but only 40% is floating and that has quite a bit of an impact when a good fraction of those rewards gets sold off again this is the poka dot dominance now there's one more interesting data point and I'm not sure what to think about this what we've got over here is the treasury balance over time and it tended to increase all the way to July of last year and it's now crashing here the poka do dominance since July of last year it went from 0.55% down to 0.3% so polka Do's relevance was roughly cut in half here are the treasury expenses over time and what we've just seen was measured in dot tokens so when we look at this measured in US Dollars we actually had a treasury at one point of more than1 billion us and that's now down to 50 million so a 95% drop in value since November of 2021 and this is November of 2021 the dot dominance only went down by 85% the treasury value went down by 95% now I published videos on porot regularly on this channel and if you haven't watched The Pri video by the poker. low then feel free to check that out Simply search for the title it was an above average performing video I will of course make updates on Dot and on various other alt coins on this channel if you don't want to miss those videos feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow in case you've got telegram then feel free to join us there's a link to our telegram Channel directly below this video looking very much forward to chatting with you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0byXt54nL3A,"['Ethereum', 'Polkadot', 'Flow', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0byXt54nL3A/hqdefault.jpg,2024-10-07T13:12:56Z

Tokenomics,  #goat #goatseusmaximus  #crypto","crypto is all about meme coins or to be more specific about meme coins on Solana or to be even more specific about mem coins in the pump. fun ecosystem now the pump. fun tokens in general performed pretty well in the last week it's the second best performing category in all of crypto the only category that did better was AI memes and within the pump. fun ecosystem the largest token is of course Goos maximos or the go token now how much potential upside is there still let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's see who's buying here and who's selling here and how much longer this current rally can last now the go token isn't just the largest of the pump. fund tokens it's the largest of all trending tokens on Solana at least when measured by the liquidity pool size the second largest is mudang with half of the liquidity pool mudang by the way is also coming from the pump. fun ecosystem and so let's have a look at that on data let's look behind the curtain I don't just like to look at Price data right A lot of people simply draw random lines on price charts but then we don't really know what drives the prices the nice thing about the blockchain is that everything is transparent we can see onchain if it's large holders that are buying or if it's small retail that it's buying now let's first have a look at how quickly the investor base is growing because especially with mem coins it's important that more and more new people come in in order to stabilize the price at a high level what we see on the left is the the number of firsttime Traders on Solana for the gold token over time so each bar here represents an individual day we pecked out on the second day after launch since then we are declining and unfortunately that decline seems to accelerate somewhat now let's compare this to the number of recurring Traders we can see that up until the 17th of October the number of firsttime Traders exceeded the number of recurring Traders now the 17th of October is over here here so we did not stop with our rally we still doubled in the price afterwards but we have then seen a sharp decline of firsttime Traders and a massive Delta to the recurring Traders on the 25th and the 25th is over here so since then we have not seen a lot of price depreciation we also see how momentum tends to slow down somewhat right the number of token transactions per day here shown on the right is also declining and that's of course a problem because the higher the market cap is the more money it takes to push the price higher if the momentum is slowing down at the same time the market cap is still high that's not that great now before we look at the trader segregation numbers one more thing I've talked about the gold token already very early on this channel the first video was 11 days ago and I'm continuing to cover goat now that video over here it was published when goat was still at 26 Cents so that was over here since then we went up by 140% in the top even by 230% roughly and so I publish videos regularly on this channel especially discussing meme coins with their onchain analytics Fe feat to subscribe I try to be early and I try to make money for all of us now let's go back to gold and the onchain analytics what we see on the left is the trading volume measured in US dollar split by Trader segment so in Gray we've got small retail that's all the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to $10,000 large retail is up to $100,000 and the Wales is above $100,000 worth of the token now we see how trading volume built up and is now coming down it peaked on the 21st of October the 21st of October by the way was a day where we saw a crash and a turnaround more on that in a second we see however how small retail tended to Peak later on the 24th of October so again that's over here and when the trading volume by small retail is peing that's usually not a good sign because why do the Wales hold a token they hold it in order to then sell it afterwards to retail right this is how crypto Works crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the Wales they obviously have more skill because they' have got more money they had some positive trades in the past now when those whales see that small retail isn't buying anymore then they might dump as well right the way it's in the end dictate where the price is going they've got most of the token but they sell once the adoption once once the exit liquidity doesn't flow in anymore and it appears as if we are at that point on the right we see the trading volume normalized to 100% And we see that less and less trading volume is now done by the Wales and we see how small retail and mediumsized Retail is now taking over starting to hold the bag and so we can simply have a look at the number of investors based on minimum holding threshold so on the left side we've got retail on the right we've got the Wales so this time we don't split this by us amounts this time we split this by a minimum holding in terms of number of tokens on the left side it's 2,000 tokens at the kind price that's a bit over $11,000 then we've got $10,000 worth of the token in the middle and 100 on the right the Wales are taking profit medium-sized retail sells slowly and small retail isn't buying anymore and so really it's about being early it's about the timing it's about buying where not a lot of other people know about it it's not about the quality of the project it's really just about hype it's about momentum and when momentum slows down it tends to move to the next opportunity so from the prior videos you probably already know goat was launched in the whole context of an AI the terminal of truths that Twitter account has now 200,000 followers and people are looking for the next opportunity here so one way to catch a wave early is to follow this Twitter account very very closely now we could simply look at the wallet and see what is that wallet currently holding unfortunately tokens like tartle or Planet AI don't have a lot of liquidity so it seems like the AI is making millions and millions of dollars but unfortunately those tokens can't be sold the liquidity pools are just a few thousand worth so don't buy ttle don't buy Plan AI but another potential approach to make money is to look at what kind of wallets made a lot of money with gold so there are several wallets that made more than a million dollar of profit and there are hundreds of wallets that made more than $100,000 worth with the goat rally alone now how did I know about goat so early I knew about early because I track wallets I look at wallets of successful Traders as we have seen but I also look at other influencers because influencers very often buy a token and then afterwards promote it on the YouTube channel and once it's promoted on YouTube then a lot of other people buy the token as well right attention means higher prices and so have a look at this that's our wallet tracker in premium we see how Kyle chesse sold his MIT token at a price of 29 cents and how he then subsequently bought goat at 14 cents MIT went down since he sold so from 29 to 25 and we all know what happened to the gold token right a multiple X return and so here's that influencer he's got 133,000 subscribers and we are tracking 12 of his wallets but in total we've got 419 wallets and yes not every signal here is profitable but still I believe this is the right approach approach to short list the tokens to potentially buy and sell and so that's why in premium we've also got dedicated Chats on individual all coins that all runs in telegram feel free to check it out it's down below it's the bitcoin.com there's even an entire video course on how to find Wallets on how to track them and on how to then interpret the signals that we get from tracking so that's over here that's eight videos and besides wallet tracking of course the micro is important portfolio management is important risk management is important there's more than 100 tutorial videos in premium again there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply message me within the first week and I refund you 100% so again to sum it all up it's all about timing you want to be early it looks like the momentum for gold is slowing down it looks like retail isn't buying that much anymore so I'm now looking for the next thing I don't have a crystal ball either I don't know where the price will go but I do believe there's better risk to reward place out there than the gold token if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQuohpY2Z-w,"['Solana', 'Flow', 'JUST', 'Threshold',

adoption, Financial messaging standard, Cross-border crypto solutions, Payment-focused blockchain projects",in November 2025 there will be a new global standard for international crossborder payments that most almost every financial institution will use I think this is going to be a very big narrative in the bull market that we are going to see and in today's video I'm going to show you the most important cryptocurrencies that are compatible with this new standard or this new protocol for international payments and the standard that I'm talking about is of course ISO 222 that will replace the complete Swift system as we know it and will become the international standard for institutions central banks to make crossborder payments so I think we still quite early because we I think Mark this video I think we're still quite early because we are not really seeing many people talk about this yet but I personally do believe that this will be a very big topic of discussion and a very big narrative in the bull market and we're going to start with the king of course with the one that actually is very compliant with this new protocol and that's of course Ripple they even have a page on their website dedicated with a onepage explaining that the world is converging to a new global standard ISO 222 too and that they are going to um yeah be compatible with that of course Ripple is one of the most famous current cryptocurrencies for that it's right now number six in the total cryptocurrency uh it has a market cap of 78 billion and it almost going to surpass a binance token and I do believe in this bull market I personally think that xrp eventually is going to overtake ethereum and be comes the second place again and I personally think that that will happen in 2025 and I have another video about that where I explain more in detail exactly about Ripple why I think that Ripple will become a disp because I actually have a lot of evidence for that and that's not only fundamental evidence or these prophetic dreams from um other people but it's really CHS that are breaking out these these are the most important pieces of evidence that show me that xrp is most likely going to outperform uh all of the cryptocurrencies above even will outperform Bitcoin but I don't think it will share the number one spot with Bitcoin as the market cap of Bitcoin is just really high but there will be a period where xrp is going to outperform bitcoin as well we are already seeing that right now so we go to the xrp in the um US dollar term and let me change my camera a little bit right here so what we can see is that we had a 7-year consolidation right right now this is breaking out this chart looks very bullish although right now we might come down a little bit like something we have seen right here massive green candles come a little bit down but then we can continue this trend that's what I'm personally expecting uh with ripple and then let's go to the tokens guys first token is Stella xlm Stella xlm is also known to be compatible with the iso 222 protocol and you can already see this in the price because the price as you can see right here is actually exploding so this what we are seeing right here these two green candles on a weekly time frame they look this price action looks way more similar than this price action rather than this price action right this is pretty choppy uh choppy growth this is really a breakout and we are already at the range highs I personally think that that's also something that we often see in Bull markets tokens that are showing strength very early on they are often also the tokens that are going where you are going to see continuous strength later on in the bull market uh but yeah we are at some resistance right now so definitely something to note but generally if we if we just look at the fundamentals and we are seeing that this Global protocol is being rolled out and xlm is one of the tokens that is compa able with this we can see this bullishness reflected in the chart I think that's a very good sign then we go to the next one guys you might have heard about this one this is Hada hashgraph also known as HB habah it's number 27 in the coin market cap list and as you can see right right here we had we were trading at way higher levels right now it is breaking out uh supp passing the previous highs very interesting we have a market cap of 5 billion and the interesting thing with hadera is that it's actually got it's actually being backed by Google and IBM so there are some Partnerships with these yeah bigger institutions and then you can already see that these institutions like Google and IBM they value uh definitely integration with fin with traditional Finance right so they would definitely um prefer to cooperate with a token that is compatible with the new global standard for international settlements and international payments that really makes sense right these these companies they want to be compliant and uh what we can see right here is that in this chart if we bring out the momentum indicators we have a very beautiful um yeah higher lows on the momentum indicator it starts here then we have a higher low a higher low and then we have we have kind of like an uptrend in the momentum indication and we we don't yet see that in the price because this is kind of like sideways move but that generally is known as a bullish Divergence and that shows us that even though the price is moving sideways right here in the momentum we can already see a change so I'm expecting I'm definitely expecting this chart to continue to see higher levels again we have seen a lot of strength over the past couple of weeks maybe we get a small shake out right now but eventually I'm expecting this to continue especially on the narrative that it is compatible with the new um yeah Global protocol for crossb payments then we go to the next one guys and this is algorand and also note guys that that much of these tokens are from the United States and the United States also fits perfectly in the narrative with the new president Trump that is pro crypto I think a lot of tokens from the United States can uh really perform good in this bull market so algorand is the next one is number 54 in the list of coin market cap it has a market cap of a little bit over two billion as you can see right here and we haven't really got out of the woods yet so let's go to the chart and then we can see in the chart that um it looks pretty similar and we have we have a nice W formation something like here we have a neckline we have a fee and another fee makes a w generally these patterns are actually very bullish because they are like a double they could be a double button formation and most of the time they are being uh confirmed whenever we break out from the neckline and we can hold above it and this would be definitely an expected breakout for algorand against US dollar the target would be the top of here which would be an increase of like 6 to 700% right that is when algorand cannot make new alltime highs or just visits the previous highs I think this token can actually perform way better uh and maybe we can we can see new alltime highs and a continuation move to the upside but these last weeks already show us and this pattern that there is some strength in this token bringing up the momentum indicator again guys we have again uh it's kind of a double bottom formation I know it's slightly higher low in the price but it's kind of a double bottom information any momentum indicator there is a higher low so again showing right here guys that the this is in my opinion from the technical side technical picture of this this is undervalued because we are entering a bull market we have the narrative set and we are seeing the momentum already shift in the background I expect this to just to blow up sooner or later also guys I do have to say this video is just for informational purposes only don't invest because I say so do your own research and follow your own feeling in terms of where you like to put your money I'm just sharing with you today the videos or the the tokens that I think are looking good and that are compatible with that new ISO 20022 standard um because I think they will they will perform really good and it can be a bull market narrative right you always have to you have to be able to look in the future what the narrative is and right now I think this could be the narrative and no one is talking about this yet right so right now it's very nice to position yourself uh because the people that are positioning right here with these candles most of the time that are people that are in this that are in this space have direct involvement with this cryptocurrency token because they already know what's coming they are they are working with that so right now we have still the advantage that this is not a mainstream narrative yet we are still on the low right here I think I I haven't heard anyone talking about this then we go to the next one guys that is Quant q&t that is $96 market cap of 1.17 billion also not yet really broken out as you can see uh pattern wise looks very interesting we have like uh declining resistance right here maybe we can do something like this where we have a falling wedge then we can see this double bottom and we can see again the momentum indicator shifting I do expect this one to break out to the upside and to meet the target of the wedge which will be roughly an increase of 250% uh but yeah this is a very young token I think this can get some extra attention and maybe uh yeah go into price Discovery and see higher levels definitely interesting token uh this is one of the tokens I'm not I'm personally not owning this one we go to the next one this one I found very interesting I actually bought this one right before the pump so that was really beautiful this is xdc Network also compatible with ISO uh 222 has a market cap pretty low of 8816 million let's go to the Chart guys chart looks pretty pretty decent right we also have like kind of this W formation probably we can see the yeah we we have a double bottom on the momentum indicator it's not a clear higher low uh but it's not looking too bad either we have some declining resistance right here which we are breaking out so we can maybe check whether this is a form of a triangle formation so we have a resistance that has been created since 2021 uh three years been coming down right now breaking out telling us that the old market conditions which was the consolidation period wide here are not that valid anymore and they they went into a new market condition which is more bullish this also looks a little bit like xrp uh with this triangle formation breaking out I think this is a good look opportunity and I I happy because I actually bought this one pretty low and right now it's pumping so I'm already up on this token and that brings me to the last token guys and this one is actually very interesting you might if you are new in this space you might not have heard of this token but if you have been quite a while around in the space you probably have heard of this token and this token is Iota and when I started with cryptocurrency back in 2016 this was actually a very big token and the narrative around this token was also pretty big it was The Internet of Things token which basically means the internet of things that uh machines can communicate with each other and they they also have certain transactions uh maybe it's nice that you can do some research about it but this this used to be I'm not 100% sure but uh in my for my um for my memory for my memory this was a top 10 token back in 2016 2016 2017 and this had a really big Community which right now I'm not really so sure of but the interesting thing is with this token is that it is it has its own narrative it is the Internet of Things token right but it's also compatible with ISO 222 so maybe this new narrative can bring some new life into this token and wake up the existing or the former Community which I personally think is very interesting and which brings me to the next part which is even more interesting um wait let's first start here we have a price of 22 cents the market cap is 800 million the chart actually looks pretty decent so when we have a look at the chart we have like this uh and you can see this goes way back till 2017 where we had this rally where we also had the all-time high and this is also um again little bit like xrp because xrp the highs we had in xrp they never surpassed right we never surpassed in 2021 the highest we made in 20 in 20 uh 177 so again that that is very interesting also bring up the momentum indicators we can see clearly that we are forming higher lows and we are forming lower lows in the price pattern wise this is a um falling wedge formation as you can see right here falling wedge formation with a bullish Divergence right here generally guys that is very bullish so when I'm just looking at the technical picture of Iota right here and I'm looking with my future vision of the narrative that can be set for 2025 the iso compatible tokens um the big community that this token used to have I actually I'm actually very positive about the outcome for this token in the coming year I think this token can get some new life similar like xrp um where yeah where we maybe can surpass the alltime highs that we've been creating in 20 2017 right we have very long consolidation almost 7year consolidation right now looks like coming to an end with these bullish divergences and this pattern of a falling W formation might take a little bit time for this one is for before this one is going to break out but in my opinion um this actually looks pretty good so all the tokens that we have been um looking at in today's video and doing some technical analysis on are all tokens compatible with this new protocol and I think the tokens that I mentioned in today's video I think they are going to perform well in the coming months in the coming 6 to 12 months probably um what they all have in common most are concentrated or based in the United States and yeah they also have a lot of similar characteristics right and I think uh I think these tokens will perform pretty good and I'm very curious what you think so let me know in the comments section what you think about this and yeah drop a thumbs up if you like this video subscribe if you have not done that yet make sure to hit the Bell icon so you get notified whenever I upload a new video Yeah I want to wish you all guys a very beautiful day today and I hope to see every single one of you in the

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #raydium #ray #crypto",radium is on a massive rally yet again but the big question is how long can this rally last let's have a look at data most people aren't looking it let's have a look at onchain data let's have a look at usage let's have a look at transaction fee generation let's have a look at all of those juicy little details most people are not considering here the r I'm talking about we up 40% today we at $250 we went up by more than 80% this week 138% this month and we made a 10x this year here now this is not the first time I talk about radium I made a video 90 days ago and you guys seem to have liked it 172 subscribers for a single video that's pretty good and that's probably because we analyzed radium when it was still at $1 now it's at $250 roughly so if you want to be early next time maybe consider following channels like this now I try to be as data driven as possible on this channel I look at the positives but also at the negatives let's start with some negatives there is for example this chart here this shows the number number of circulating Ray tokens over time and this is increasing quite linearly and this went up by 40% in the last year if the demand hadn't outgrown that Supply then of course the price would have gone down but this is not what we are seeing what this tells us though is that this is definitely a coin to only hold during the bull market in the bare Market that token inflation will decimate you and that's actually not just Theory that's practice the token inflation completely destroyed void the price we were once at almost $15 and then went all the way down to the 20 cent range even going occasionally below that so this is not a Buy and Hold coin forever right this is the token that you want to trade actively that you want to buy but that you also want to sell at some point when the momentum turns around and so here's an interesting chart this shows us the total value locked on the radium decentralized exchange from the last year beginning of last year 2023 to today and yes the is nicely going up due to the bull market no surprise here but again this is a US dollar chart measured in s so tokens that looks very different the total value locked even went down so in other words all of that rally was 100% due to Solana going up radium simply gets pulled up by the overall Rush on Solana but this Rush can be pretty massive this is the US dollar trading volume on radium over time this is exploding this is generating a lot of fees and so the capital that's been attracted by radium is of course also spiking up due to the High apys created through that swapping activity and the fraction of the entire Market though the radium decentralized exchange is not necessarily growing it picked up somewhat in the last months due to mcoin trading but still the very long term is not necessarily an outperformance or a gain of more market share versus other decentralized exchanges so this is the liquidity lock chart here's the market share for the trading volume also not necessarily growing simply just holding its position so why then is the price going up because of course in US Dollars everything is going up right Solana is going up the trading activity is going up especially in the meme coins the question is who is buying here and is this mainly new buyers or is this simply recurring Traders because an expanding investor base would of course be great for the price I use this approach for meme coins but we can also use this simply for radium this chart comes from a tool that I've developed myself and you can get access to this tool in the premium membership the link is down below the Bitcoin tr.com you can plug in any Solana token in this tool and it shows us for the last 90 days the number of recurring Traders versus firsttime Traders and we want to see the first time Traders going up because that shows us that a lot of new investors join potentially pushing up the radium price and when we correlate this to the price development for example here the spike on the 6th of March when we check the price here on the 6th of March not much has happened but then suddenly on the 7th the price increased by quite a bit by like 25 30% so new people entering the token means subsequent price relies that's why I like this onchain data so much and so what happened recently look at this the number of first-time Traders again outpaced the recuring Traders quite a bit the Delta is quite large and so that explains why we are rallying again and could potentially rally further what's important to note though is that radium is already quite large and has a lot of token inflation and a lot of ownership by centralized exchanges that might temporarily manipulate the price okx has radium on their books up bit as well and it's kind of ironic that the trading volume of the radium token is just at number six on its own exchange I do believe that we have positive momentum here I do believe that trading is continuing to heat up and I do believe there might be additional positive returns here that being said the market cap is already 640 million and again the fully diluted market cap is 1.4 billion think token inflation so I think it's a good shortterm hold as in holding this while the rally is lasting holding this while speculation is high but once that stops you definitely want to exit let's take advantage of the C momentum but never forget to take profit if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish this regly

one of the best performing meme coins on the binance smart chain today the question is what's driving this who's buying here who's selling here does it still make sense to buy the token let's have a look at some onchain analytics let's dive behind the price data to dive deeper and look at things most people are not considering now here are the trending tokens on the binance smart chain ordered by their liquidity pool size and we've got two liquidity pools not one but two liquidity Pools by teams it's the sixth largest token in terms of liquidity on the Chain we are up 61% today 137% this month and more than 1,000% this year and with a current market cap of a bit under 200 million it's still relatively small in the grand scheme of things the largest meme coin across all of crypto is Dogecoin with 57 billion with a b and we have to scroll quite a bit down until we get to the 200 million Mark so there's quite a bit of potential upside now I always like like to look at the following data for any token before I buy it I like to look at the data over here this comes from dexc screen.com so I simply search for the token on Dex screener and have a look at this we can see the number of buyers versus Sellers and the buying volume versus the selling volume now we are up 55% because the buying volume is larger than the selling volume but at the same time we see that the number of buyers is actually smaller than the number of sellers in other words the current buyers they tend to move more money per transactions than the sellers do which is surprising given that the price was shooting up that much right if you're buying for a fixed amount and then you're selling after a gain your sell transaction is higher than the buying transaction but it appears as if the interest by the buyers is even higher and they deploy more Capital seems like potentially whales are getting in now this is the token distribution of teams it seems to be relatively well distributed this very large piece of the pie is just other accounts this is not a single wallet and so let's have a look at the onchain data let's see who's buying and selling here in detail let's have a look at the number of retail investors versus whale investors for example let's see what's behind those 43,000 holders on chain now before we do this one more thing I've already published a video on teams before and here's what's so fascinating when you talk about a token that's not really trending and you're simply just discovering interesting onchain data YouTube does not necessarily send this to a lot of people an average video is here in Gray the chams video that was published 1 month ago is here in blue at the time the price was at 624 now we are at 6078 so more than a 3X since then and so I publish videos on this channel regularly on various meme coins and I try to be early so if you don't want to miss the next video then Fe free to subscribe Fe free to potentially even hit the notification Bell because again YouTube is not really with us on our side with the algorithm only when a token has already risen when it's very popular that's when YouTube will show it to a broader audience the smaller hidden gems unfortunately are not shown that easily and so here we go we've got the number of retail investors on the left and the number of whale investors on the right and we distinguish this by the number of tokens that are held Now teams has a lot of zeros and so even the retail investor has 1 trillion tokens so those 11,000 wallets they own roughly $788 of the token when we go another 10x in minimum holding so now $7 to $8,000 worth we have 2,200 wallets and another 10x so now 70 to $80,000 worth of the token we count 334 wallets and so I find this fascinating the number of retail investors rather tended to Trend downwards it was especially the mediumsized retail wallets and the whales that are going up now especially with this recent R this seems to be all whale accounts right the number of whales is going up the other accounts are going down so we see a similar picture to what we've already observed over here right with the comparison of number of buyers versus buying volume that being said that Push by the Wales still introduces a lot of new firsttime Traders have a look at the number of new Traders versus returning Traders over time most days it was simply just the existing traders that trade against one another yesterday however we have seen a massive influx of new users now we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over today has just started but it seems like so far since beginning of the day it's mainly again returning users So Yesterday 68% of all of trading was done by completely new wallets so far since beginning of the day this tends to be turning around again we see a very similar setup for the number of buyers versus sellers again a massive Spike yesterday again an overhang of a lot of buyers yesterday and let's see how today's data point will play out it's still very calm it's early hours in Europe and it's night in America now here's what historically has happened have a look at this the 5th of October we had the same kind of bias overhang and it seems like that kind of overhang can carry us for a while because here is that 5ifth of October and subsequently we still went up by 2 144% are we going to see the same this time your guess is as good as mine this seems to be a rally driven by the big whales where now retail is following as well and so if this can continue very much depends on whether or not the Wales will dump or continue holding for a while and so pretty much all of the outperformance right now comes from the memec coin Market have a look at the different categories within crypto Zoo themed tokens performed the best in the last week the pump. fun ecosystem which is the launch pad of meme coins on Solana performed second best then we've got AI memes bass memes Solana memes frog themed Etc most of this is meme coins and so let's have a look at this pump. fun ecosystem the big question is how can we identify tokens that become really really large still at an early point so for example over here the peanut token which almost doubled in the last week and is now the largest market cap it's now at $161 how can we find a token like this when it's just at a few cents or how can we find a token like Goos maximos again when it's just at a few cents not above a dollar because I published a video on Goat when we still at 24 cents and I also published a video on Peanut when it was still at 11 cents the way to find those kind of tokens early is through wallet tracking so have a look at this alert the peanut token it was bought by Crypt banter when it was still at 3 cents Crypt is one of the largest channels in all of YouTube around crypto they've got 1.1 million subscribers and so since that alert the price went up by more than 5,000% I believe that Meme coin trading is not just a game of luck it's also a game of skill and if you follow the Insiders if you follow the people that move markets if you follow the traders that t to make the right calls in the past we do have potentially a market Edge and so it's all about finding those kinds of people it's all about finding those wallets and we track various wallets by Crypt Benta we've got 33 wallets in total but we track more than 400 so it's not just Crypt banter that we track we also track Alex Becker we also track KY chesse we also track crypto gains we've got a lot of influencers that we're tracking and so I really believe in the strategy I made a dedicated tutorial section just on on this topic how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then track those influencer wallets and once we track them how can we interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total and it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin trade.com but premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video it's also about back testing it's also about risk management and portfolio diversification there's more than 100 videos in total feel free to check it out now once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when to buy when to sell we have to discuss the analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so yes I do believe that teams has quite a bit of upside potential it is important though to continue monitor the whales to potentially even set a stop loss because once the whales sell then the price can also correct if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

let's have a look whether or not this is manipulation by a few whales or if there is actually accumulation happening across the board let's look at onchain data most people aren't considering so here's the obvious we are up almost 30% today the price is currently at 2 cents this month we are up 80% and since listing on coin market cap in March of this year we more than 10x now the nice thing about the Giga token is that it's traded directly on Solana it's not traded on the centralized exchanges where we cannot really have a look at the data among the trending tokens Giga is the seventh largest in terms of liquidity we've got 2.6 million in the token here's the historical runup in US Dollar on a linear scale here's the same chart in so on a logarithmic scale so head your bought in February of this year and then sold one month afterwards you had turned $11,000 into $100,000 now I want to share a few approaches in this video with any tokens to see whether or not there's manipulation happening the first thing that's interesting is to see if the numbers align so for example here on S scan we can see that the number of holders is at 11,000 when we look at the number of followers on the Twitter account we see 9,000 so that makes sense when we look at the number of telegram members we are at 8,800 also pretty much in the same ballpark and so you can already see from the beginning of this video that we're not just going to go through the website and we're going to discuss the marketing Jaz I want to look at the data most people aren't considering any token that's not on a centralized exchange needs to be checked for its security and for that I tend to use Dex tools. there is a DEX tools score with 99 out of 99 a perfect score no red flags to be worried about that could indicate a honey pot so I do not believe that this token will go to zero anytime soon which unfortunately a lot of those trending tokens on the blockchain do right you always want to look at the security scan and again all the trading happens decentralized there's no blackbox activity happening in centralized exchanges and this is the good thing because that gives us a nice Insight on trading activity what we see over here is since launch of the token the trading volume based on wallet size so small retail is the wallets with less than $11,000 worth of the token medium retail is $1,000 to $10,000 large retail is $10,000 to 100,000 and whale is above $100,000 worth of the token what do we notice we see that over time the whales tend to buy more and more and small retail tends to rather become inactive when we don't normalize this to 100% but we just look at the US dollar volume you can also see how over time more and more money is flowing in there's more and more trading activity that corresponds with the growing market cap now I believe it's most important that all wallet cohorts tend to accumulate so it's not necessarily about trading volume it's about what kind of wallets hold the token is small retail continuing to buy are the whales continuing to buy as well or are the whales potentially taking profit that could then depress the price check this out on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 Giga tokens so that's very small retail with $20 worth of the token in the middle we've got people with 10 times that amount so $200 minimum holding also going up on the right side we've got the number of wallets with at least $2,000 worth at the current prices let's go another 10x now we've got on the left a minimum holding of $20,000 worth of the token in the middle it's $200,000 and on the right it's 2 million worth of the token what can we see from those charts we can see that retail in aggregate tends to buy the number of retail investors isn't falling we also see that the number of wallets that have at least $200,000 worth of the token also still tends to increase and yes there are some Mega whales still in the token currently six of those whale wallets with 2 million worth of the token but we're also seeing that a lot of them have already taken profit right and all of that sell pressure that comes from those wallets is mainly digested so this is not a fall from a th000 wallets to 900 wallets and we could still see a lot of selling pressure here we have come almost to zero already so this chart can't go much further down anymore and the other charts are all going up this is pretty much the best kind of onchain setup that you want to see the smart money is taking over the listing on centralized exchanges hasn't yet happened and all wallet cohorts are buying the Giga token might indeed be the needle in the hay stack because unfortunately most blockchains aren't doing that well recently Solana has seen a total value locked increase in the last month so has avalan but most blockchains did rather poorly we also see that there's not that much Capital flowing into crypto anymore the expansion has slowed down this is the market cap of various stable coins combined and we saw pretty much zero growth in May June and July now we are picking up again with roughly half the pace that we've seen before so the numbers around the Giga token look very nice un forun ately the overall picture of all of crypto doesn't look that great so if you suddenly see a crash in Bitcoin then of course the Giga token will also have a hard time if crypto as a whole can stay where it currently is or if it can even expand from here further then probably the Giga token will also go up simply because there isn't a lot of selling pressure we've seen this on chain if you found this useful feel free to give this a like I publish videos regularly so feel free to subscribe as well I will also do updates on the Giga token on this channel as well if you're interested in tours like this and if if you want to know how to build those tools and how to use those tools feel free to check out the premium membership

Brett Price, Brett Price Prediction, Brett longterm, Brett Tokenomics,  #brett #memecoin #crypto","there aren't too many opportunities on the base chain there's of course Aerodrome but Aerodrome is already very large when we look at mcoin trading bread is the largest one on the base chain now does it make sense to buy bread right now it was bleeding quite a bit with the rest of the mem coin Market in the last week does it make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at some onchain metrics to see whether or not there's long-term adoption and whether or not it makes sense to take potential opportunity here now Bas has seen quite a bit of adoption its total value lock is 2.4 billion and its trend is pretty consistent it's the sixth largest chain in terms of tvl and it's the fourth largest chain in terms of bridged total value locked and so it appears as if recently all of defi is rather taking a breather right now Bas is not taking a breather now here are the top trending tokens on base and of course we've got the newly issued coinbase Bitcoin but we've also got Aerodrome Aerodrome with a liquidity of 130 million and we've got the largest of the meme coins red with only a liquidity pool of 8.2 million note how the base chain has much less meme coins compared to Solana with Solana every single trending token is now a mem coin now we're currently at 7.8 cents we are down more than 20% this week and that's happening while Bitcoin barely moved it only went down by 3% and so since listing on coin market cap Brett doubled roughly it's up 101% however it's all about being early when we look at the liquidity pool when we look at when Brett actually started trading on the base chain we see very very different gains in the first few days Brett appreciated by more than 30,000 per. and so is this a potential opportunity now are we potentially seeing a flaw here let's look at the onchain analytics in a second let's dive into the individual transactions in a moment I first want to share my statistics around YouTube for Brett because I published various videos on the token already on this channel so there's six videos on Brett on this channel one of them had been a rock pool so Chinese Brad we identified this in the video as well I hope nobody got burned by this the warning in the video was pretty clear it was a training token at the time but have a look at the number of views it started off with 7,000 it stayed at 7,000 then 45,000 then 8,000 and the recent video has a bit fewer views but it's also the newest of the videos it's still on average an outperformer so the average video is in gray that recent video is in blue in other words it seems like there is still a lot of consistent retail interest the number of views over time isn't really declining and even the recently published video is outperforming now let's get into the meat of this channel I like to look at onchain data regularly over here let's look at what all of those hundreds of thousands of holders are doing on the base chain we've got almost 700,000 holders but not all of them are created equally some of them might just have a few cents worth of the token so let's introduce some minimum holding thresholds on the on the left side we've got the number of wallets over time that have at least 10,000 bread tokens so at the current price that's $780 that's what I consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's another 10x in minimal holding so roughly $88,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's $18,000 worth of the token it seems like the Wales pretty much stopped accumulating medium-sized retail buys a little bit it seems like the smallest of the wallets by the fastest now what does that mean we're currently at 35,5 500 wallets 1 month from now we were at 35,3 so we grew by less than 1% in the course of a month we see growth but not very quick growth so there's some kind of a stagnation in the adoption on top of that we also see how trading volume seems to be dominated by the centralized exchanges because a lot of the trading volume happens via Bots via returning users this is something we don't see that often on chain we see more than 85% of trading volume on a day by return returning users not by new users and so here's the spot trading volume just ordered by the different exchanges we don't even see Aerodrome or Unis swap over here we also see quite a bit of activity on the bets on the price via Perpetual Futures the number of buyers and sellers per day is also on a rather low level historically and so I'm personally not surprised by this I have the impression Brett is simply too large I have the impression that the market currently is splitting what we've got over here is the others dominance so this is is how much of all of crypto is currently in the altcoins that are not in the top 10 and since beginning of the year this tends to rather go down at the same time we see how the Bitcoin dominance is going up and that's because of the positive inflows into the Bitcoin ETF there is a split Happening Here There is one part of the investor base that simply just wants to get exposure to crypto and it just buys the hardest of the assets that buys Bitcoin either directly on chain or indirectly through the ETF and then there's the other part of investors that want to get the 10x the 100x returns and when then a market cap of a meme coin gets too large there is no more 10 or 100x so it's either about allocating to the largest asset to bitcoin or it's about buying the very small assets the middle is shrinking away the defi protocols that have very large market caps or the meme coins that are in the hundreds of millions have a comparatively harder time because check this out when we order by market cap in the last 7 days all the meme coins lost but when we look at the meme coins that appreciated in the last 7 days all of them are rather small in market cap there's only two that are above 100 million the other meme coins that gained are only in the T of millions and again Brett has a market cap of 700 million it can that easily 10x from here it's all about being early it's all about buying when a token has freshly launched and it's not about buying when there's already hundreds of millions of market cap and so then there's the big question right how can we identify such tokens early before they are big and my answer to this is wallet tracking I like to track wallets of influencers and of traders that have a good record check this out this is part of Premium so there's a premium membership of this Channel and this is the influencer trade Channel and we see here how the Dogecoin millionaire bought some bread we see how cryptol lifter bought some bread we see how handsome Finance bought bread and those kind of signals started off in the middle of March already and so we've got 12 wallets by Alex specka not all of those wallets are welln we've got 33 wallets by Crypt Benta a Channel with more than a million subscribers we've got 55 wallets of crypto gains who does have quite a bit of influence on small cap cryptocurrencies I find the topic so important that I created a dedicated video tutorial course so there's eight videos on how to find different influencer Wallets on how to track them and how to then afterwards analyze and interpret those signals that we get from the tracking there's not just wallet tracking videos there's more than 100 videos in total there's also videos about risk management portfolio management blockchain analytics Etc of course there also dedicated Chats on when to buy and sell for the different alt coins we also discuss the onchain metrics over there and I share my own trades as well for example here this ethereum short that I opened recently and there are regularly published videos on the market as a whole as well so feel free to check it out it's $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% so again I think the opportunity now is not in bread it might be on Bas base continues to grow but it's probably rather in the smaller meme coins that still see adoption Bret doesn't really see accumulation that's quick enough if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I apolog you a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

FI application 300 million of the total 680 million are just in that single application but when we have a look at the actual application there isn't that much trading volume here 10 million for the most active of the liquidity pools in the last 24 hours compare this with the trading volume on ethereum that's 1.6 billion so 160 times the size have a look at the trading volume on Solana 1.7 billion same magnitude check out the binance smart chain 600 million so for whatever reason the total value locked on Solana relative to ton is only eight times the size but the trading volumes that we can actually see on the most used decentralized application it's not just eight times smaller it's 170 times smaller some numbers seem to be inflated here the number of active accounts I believe isn't that accurate either because again that's the beauty of the blockchain we can have a look at the transactions to the ton Network for example how much capital is getting bridged from say ethereum over to ton we don't have the best onchain analytics for ton but we do have them for ethereum have a look at this this is a ton ethereum Bridge addresses how many addresses or how many wallets have bridged over 2 ton on a given day and this hovers around 100 Maybe speaking at around 300 wallets per day but that's the entire magnitude that's a far cry from the millions of accounts that get created every month have a look at the dollars that get bridged over from ethereum to ton yes there are weeks where millions of dollars get bridged the peak was at roughly 3 million in the second week of April of this year but again this is a far cry from those $680 million total value lock it's not Capital that's flowing in from ethereum for sure now there's different ways to own ton right you can buy the ton coin on the centralized exchange this is what most people do you can also buy the bridged versions on ethereum and on the binance smart chain so there are equivalent tokens on Eve and on the BC and the good news is that we can dive into those statistics very transparently on chain so on ethereum we've got 28,000 holders of ton coin on the B B smart chain we've got 68,000 holders so it appears as if there's more Capital even on the binance smart chain compared to ethereum but this is only the first impression and that impression is actually wrong let me show you a bit of a complex setup of charts I know at the beginning it can be a bit overwhelming but I'll walk you through this what we see here is ethereum data so how many holders are there over time for the ethereum based ton token and we've got this since Inception that's the first line over here and we've got this only for the last month that's the second line now there are minimum holding thresholds to be counted in those graphs for the left charts you have to hold at least 100 ton tokens to be counted but at the current price that's roughly $600 that's what I'd consider retail but the chart in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's a minimum of 1,000 tokens so that's now $6,000 for the right chart we go another 10x that's now at least 60 ,000 that's what I'd consider Wales long-term all wallet cohorts seem to be buying in the last month it was mainly small retail that accumulated medium-sized retail and Wales didn't do much here are the same kind of charts but not for the ethereum chain but for the binance smart chain here we can see that the whales are actually exiting we can also see that the number of retail investors isn't growing since April of 2022 so everybody that's buying ton on chain seems to be doing this on the ethereum Chain not on the binance smart chain but here's the interesting part there seems to be hidden sell pressure because the number of whales that is shrinking over here is offsetting pretty much the number of whales that grow over here right so on the ethereum Chain Wales enter on the Bing smart chain Wales exit but those two effects are pretty much offsetting each other for medium-sized retail and for small retail we rather see growth now the growth is not massive but it is exist now when the number of small retail wallets is growing by 5 to 10% in the last month why did the price of ton then go down by 20% while at the same time Bitcoin simply didn't move at all and ethereum went down only by 10% why did ton underperform that much we can't see it on chain and it also doesn't seem to be token inflation at least officially is $6 here actually the bottom is ton potentially now a good buy let's check out relative valuation charts let's not just look at the US dollar chart but at relative valuation to ethereum because ethereum is obviously the largest competitor with its own smart contract platform this is ton relative to e and it's interesting how this is pumping and dumping relatively predictably there is a pretty clear trading range and unfortunately we are pretty high on that trading range the potential gain is maybe 20 or 21% the potential loss though is 60% maybe even 65% ton is very much dominated by centralized exchange trading most trading volume happens on okx bybit Mexi Etc and we've also got Perpetual Futures again on bybit and on okx but binance is also part of the party and so maybe the selling pressure might be coming from those centralized exchanges maybe they got some ton and most people aren't aware of that allocation there is a an article that discusses this fear free to Google that article it's on medium it's titled ton blockchain a group of related whales mined 85% of ton Supply that article came out in March of 20123 so fear free to check it out it's something that might explain why we see this massive volatility in the price relative to ethereum from time to time while in terms of adoption in terms of numbers of wallets we actually see relatively constant growth why would the price of ton suddenly dump relative to e by 70% when there's more and more people jumping on the investment the only explanation I have is that some whales on those centralized exchanges are Distributing I know critical reviews on cryptocurrencies don't necessarily get thumbs up because everybody

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #donaldtremp #tremp #crypto","who would have thought that a win of Donald Trump would lead to a crash of all the Trump related meme coins now this was a typical sell the newest event the question is does it now make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's try to figure out who's actually selling here is this small retail or is this the Wales now in this video we're going to focus on the  token we're going to focus on the largest of the Trump related meme coins on Solana Trump is among the trending Tok to on the chain it's at number 12 in terms of liquidity it's got 1.5 million and it's up 30% today alone now here's the crash that happened with the Trump election win we went down by more than 76% but doesn't Mak sense to buy now now besides the performance today here's something what's interesting trp's market cap is only 12 million and that compares to the market cap of the mega H token on ethereum with 31 million or to the mega Trump token with 74 million so trp is the Trump related mem coin with the lowest market cap and that means we've got more upside of course also more risk but when we already bet on a meme coin anyways we might as well take the one that has the potential to 10x now here's my Approach on this channel I don't like to look just at the website because the website doesn't give us any information that most people don't have we want to get an edge we want to pick the bottoms and the tops better than others thus I like to look at the onchain metrics but first let's have a look whether are not the numbers align so on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 28,000 followers on telegram we've got 15,000 members and on chain on Solana we've got 35,000 holders so that's all within the same ballpack right the numbers aren't orders of magnitudes apart from one another so there's no obvious fraud at least here let's see what we can discover with the onchain metrics we've got the first versus recurring Traders on the left side we've got the number of transactions on the right side so it's very interesting that on the day when the price crashed not only the recurring Traders peaked also the number of firsttime Traders peaked of course during the crash we've also seen the number of token transactions going up now attention comes in waves and the token is no different we have seen three waves now the first one upon launch the second one in Q2 of this year and then up to the election so on the left side we've got the trading volume in US Dollars on the right side we've got the trading volume normalized to 100% now normalizing the trading volume gives us a nice Insight if currently small retail or medium-sized retail or large retail is dominating trading it seems like there's no clear Trend it's pretty balanced by the way the split up is small retail is all wallets below $1,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and the Wales is all the wallets above 100,000 now here's a very fascinating chart and again I like to look at this kind of chart pretty much in any video on this Channel we've got the number of retail investor wallets and the number of whale investor wallets in the middle we've got medium-sized and we can very clearly see how the whale simply just tended to sell off over time but we can also see how theyve been way less reactive relatively speaking to those election events we can see how retail really sold the news off and this seems to have been a very strong contributor to the crash now as long as retail sales this is not good but it seems like this is slowing down somewhat which could give us hope because when we look at the price development we are very close to what appears to be a technical support we have bounced off the current level quite regularly now the number of whale wallets didn't decrease but what's interesting is that the relative Holdings of those whales went down to the same degree as to what we've seen with retail retail simply just sold all of their Holdings the weers just sold parts of the Holdings and the reason why I know this is because of relative Holdings so check this out this is the token balance relative to those different holder categories and it doesn't necessarily appear as if the retail share of all of token Holdings went down massively yes the value of all of those wallet cohorts went down but the relative token share did not so there are roughly 400 retail wallets that sold everything but since the Wales sold some as well they didn't really gain relatively speaking in market share it appears as if everybody is moving very cautiously with trmp we do see of course first purchasing otherwise we wouldn't see the price ring that much I did find some very influential people buying other meme coins of trump though now have a look at this this comes from the wallet tracking of the premium membership of this channel we track various top successful Traders and influencers and we've seen how influencer Archie Lim actually sold his  tokens he had two such transactions one on the 10th of October another one on the 12th of October and he did this before the crash at 36 and 37 CS now we are at 12 cent unfortunately we haven't seen him buying back the token we have seen other influencers buying other Trump related tokens but trp so far isn't yet been bought that much now I really enjoy wallet tracking I really like to look at what are those influencers doing because a lot of them buy a token to afterwards then promote it on the channel and then generating a price search I personally never buy a token before talking about it here on this channel I don't like this conflict of interest but I very much like to Simply track what others are doing there's even a dedicated tutorial course in premium just on how to track other wallets how to find the wallets how to then track them and how to afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium feel free to check it out and of course it's not just the selling signals that are interesting it's also the buying signals right here on the 12th of October bought Sigma and that was for 9 cents now we are at 15 cent of course besides all of those signals we also have to discuss them there are't Chats on those individual alt coins in premium as well so this is where we then discuss when to buy when to sell so feel

Ponke Review, Ponke Price, Ponke Price Prediction, Ponke longterm, Ponke Tokenomics,  #ponke #memecoin #crypto","crypto isn't too strong recently but one meme coin is doing quite well and that's pky on the Solana chain let's have a look at some onchain data let's have a look at some data most people aren't considering to try to find out how much longer this really could potentially last we are currently at 46.5 up by 10% today alone and this week we increased by more than 33% and that's all happening why Bitcoin isn't doing much and even Solana didn't react too much to the Solana ETF rumors now this is not the first video on py on this channel I published one 1 and a half months ago and the video actually outperformed your average video on this channel at the time the price was at 36 Cents again now we are at 46 cents if this is your first time hearing about py maybe consider following channels like this I try to publish videos earlier and I publish videos regularly as well now here's why we should about pky in the first place when we look at the tokens on the Solana chain and we order them by their liquidity pool size as in how much capital is actually locked up in that particular token on Solana then py is at number seven it's the seventh largest token on Solana it might not have a massive market cap it's only 250 million but for onchain trading it's really relevant and so here's what's so interesting about this recent rally in the last 24 hours the number of buyers did not exceed the number of sellers it's both exactly 1,187 wallets so when the price is still going up that means that the purchase amount that the buyers put in was larger on average than the seller amount and that is very much noteworthy given that the price tended to Trend upwards right the people that bought back in may they made more than a 2x so those kind of sellers should on average be selling more in US Dollars now but it appears like the larger wallets tend to now get in let's look at that kind of data in a bit more detail I've built a tool for Solana tokens where we can have a look at the buyers and sellers and the returning Sellers and the new buyers Etc let's have a look at all of this so the tool is available to the premium members feel free to check it out it's down below it's the bitcoin.com you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and what we see here is that actually the number of recurring Traders tended to exceed the number of firsttime traders in the last month this is not necessarily that great especially with weam coins we want to see an expanding investor base but as you've already discovered it's not the number of Traders it's not a big wave of retail investors that are getting in it's simply the larger wallets it appears that those larger wallets tend to make a lot of smaller transactions though the number of transactions peaked yesterday so today hasn't yet finished it's just a few hours after midnight UTC but in the last 24 hours there were more transactions than usual on chain and so let's segregate by wallet size let's look at the whales at large retail and at mediumsized retail small retail is all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is the wallets that have between 1,000 and 10,000 large retail is between 10,000 and 100,000 and Wales is above 100,000 now we don't see any real long-term Trend but we do see quite a bit of a peak of mediumsized retail that happened yesterday we see something similar on the 29th and on the 24th and 23rd and so this is when py tended to outperform again right the 23rd the 24th is where a lot of medium-sized retail bought in small retail didn't really do too many transactions and so that's then when we tend to see the outperformance I believe this is in general a pretty strong effect usually when the smart money gets in as in when the larger wallets get in right the larger wallets tend to make the smarter calls the more you trade the more accumulates this is an effect I believe is relatively consistent within crypto there is smart wallets and there's not so smart wallets the larger wallets tend to be smarter as in they've traded more Capital tended to acrude towards those wallets so they're larger so in general when large wallets buy that's a very important sign now here's a bit bit of a problem pky is resisting a general crypto downtrend py is pretty much the needle in the Hast stack right most alt coins are doing poorly py is outperforming and the question is really how much longer can this outperformance last the onchain data for pky looks all right but I personally prefer to rather bet on falling prices now and here's why the onchain data for py looks quite okay but I personally I prefer to bet on falling prices now not of P but of altcoins in general because I believe most altcoins tend to underperform bitcoin most of the time have a look at this this is the others dominance since beginning of the year so this is all the altcoins that are not in the top 10 as a fraction of all of crypto so at the beginning of the year roughly 13 to 14% was in those not top cryptocurrencies that now went down to 10.4% the relevancy of those smaller altcoins shrunk by more than 20% so despite the memec coin trading frenzy on Solana this year altcoins in general didn't do too well and I believe even the meme coins aren't going to do too well py might be doing all right but meme coins as a whole as a category might not check this out this is another chart since beginning of the year this is the stable coin market cap which tended to increase up until April of this year since April of this year we don't see any more fiat currency flowing into crypto it's pretty much just flat and that means crypto becomes even more player versus player if the market as a whole is expanding then it's existing players versus new players that come in when no new players are coming in then it's existing player versus existing player it gets way rougher and so here's what I personally do I simply bet on falling prices of assets like this one this particular asset went down by more than 60% this year very consistently right with very little volatility and that's what I believe is the real alpha maker right now why try to pick the needle in the Hast stack when you can bet on the Hast stack on average going down I know it's not a very popular approach but I personally bet on falling prices now I look at various altcoins that tend to have bad toonomic that tend to have an expanding Supply but where demand doesn't keep up and then I bet on those alt coins relatively speaking at least to underperform altcoin trading is for expanding crypto markets currently the market I believe is not expanding what I think is better is to Simply bet on falling prices when it's player versus player because again returns are very much concentrated in a few winners it's a Winner Takes most market and when The Winner Takes most why not at least get the odds in our favor and not try to pick those few winners rather bet on the losers continuing to lose so I made a dedicated tutorial on that it's 42 minutes in length in premium feel free to check it out premium is also where I share what kind of asset this is and where you can actually short this where you can make money from this continuing to fall but if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram group the link is as well down below looking very much

Drift Review, Drift Price, Drift Price Prediction, Drift longterm, Drift Tokenomics,  #drift #crypto #altcoin","the drift protocol has a lot of things going for it the usage is increasing this is the total value locked on the Solana chain and that usage might even accelerate in the next one or two months let's have a look at The Good the Bad and the Ugly so here's one of the good things when we look at the total value lock not in US dollars but measured in Solana the growth is even more steady so all the fluctuation we can see on the US dollar chart is solely because crypto as a whole fluctuates but the adoption is pretty constant now a lot of that total value locked increase has to do with existing users so there aren't too many new users coming in at least for the Perpetual Futures product but the platform is very sticky many people that wants tried it continue to use it and so we see a pretty stable number of transactions over time we're seeing quite a few assets deposited this month and the Insurance Fund tends to grow with that now here's the bread and butter product of drift protocol it's a decentralized Perpetual Futures Trading platform on Solana so if you feel like gambling you can bet with 20x on Solana on bitcoin or on ethereum and even on some more exotic cryptocurrencies we've got even meme coins in here popcat Etc but the pital Futures is actually not what's interesting here at first glance the token looks super boring since it's airdrop in May of this year we simply just went sideways now we are at 49 but here's the kicker the focus of drift becomes now its new betting platform so check this out this is their Twitter bet on drift it's got 111,000 followers and here's the product the BET product on drift with a 52% chance that Donald Trump will win the election there is $3 million on that bet there's another 21 million on whether or not Camila Harris will win the popular vote so we've got five political bet open right now Formula 1 betting is going to come and since the presidential election will be on the 5th of November this is where I believe a lot of adoption for drift can accelerate and that might lead us to Breaking finally the sidewards trading range now one has to wonder why did the price go sideways while at the same time the usage of the platform is growing I believe the reason for that price under performance relatively speaking is twofold first of all we had a lot of receivers of the air drop that simply sold that governance token secondly the supply of drift tends to grow over time let's have a look at both let's start off with the toomics there's 53% going to the community and ecosystem and 10% of that was the airdrop launch now it's not worry that 43% goes to trading rewards so if you're using the platform you earn drift tokens that you might sell so that's constant sell pressure but there's also 25% for product protocol development and 22% for strategic participants so those are not necessarily pretty tokenomics now let's have a look at how this unlocks over time we are now at month 4 to 5 after launch we are currently over here and one year from now the supply will more than double again that's not pretty and so I'm not sure how well drift can do after the presidential election I believe that there will be a lot of demand during the election but long term things are a bit questionable now let's have a look at whether or not there still pressure from the airdrop we've got the data here this comes from a tool that I've developed myself that's available to the premium members so you can plug in any Solana token into that tool and get similar kinds of data and I believe this is very useful this counts the number of wallets with minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 drift tokens so at the current price that's $489 for the middle chart we go a 10x from that so that's now a minimum holding of $5,000 for the right we look at the Wales that's a minimum holding of $50,000 now the whales didn't sell at all they rather accumulated medium-sized retail and small retail did sell but it looks like the selling has somewhat slowed down it appears that in the last 3 weeks there was no net selling anymore and so that's then also where the price was able to recover quite a bit and so does it make sense to buy drift now to then potentially sell close to the presidential election I believe this could be a play that might pay off but there are two carats nothing in crypto is safe the first one is potential manipulation by the centralized exchanges because yes the drift protocol can be traded across various Cs and there are even Perpetual Futures on the token which by the way aren't used that much right now so currently the price doesn't seem to be too manipulated but it's definitely a possibility in the future the second caveat is unfortunately again that trading range because we can have a look at this in a bit more detail instead of looking at the US dollar chart we now look at the relative variation to Solana and that shows us a range from bottom to top of roughly 100% or the other way around ofus 50% and unfortunately we are pretty high on that range and so psychologically some people might take profit over here but still looking at the number of retail investors it seems like not too many people are exiting just yet and so I believe the drift token is a nice short-term bet up until the presidential election what happens afterwards is of course in the Stars will the platform still be used enough with the Formula 1 product will the bad toomics take over nobody knows but at least for now things seem to be aligned quite nicely the rails are buying small retail stopped selling and drift is heavily betting on additional usage due to this event I personally will buy some drift after releasing of this video several hours afterwards I never buy a token beforehand and then promote it here on YouTube I don't want this conflict of interest so I always buy after after releasing a video if you appreciate this feel free to give this a like feel free to

overview of meme coins and it's ordered by the performance in the last s days SHP is at number one and unfortunately I did not buy even though I got a direct message from one of our premium members I reacted too late to this but have a look at this this is Rafal he messaged me about TR more than one week ago and so the big question is how much longer can this really now last we have seen quite a bit of a dip does it make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people aren't looking at now there's actually quite a bit of a misconception most people think that the altcoins in general are currently doing pretty well but that can't be further from the truth check this out this is the others dominance so this is how much market cap of all of crypto is currently in the alt coins that are not in the top 10 and this went down since beginning of the year by 28% really the market is now segregating into two segments on the one hand we've got the Bitcoin investor that simply just wants to get exposure to crypto that might want to diversify away from property and from stocks and then on the other hand there are the active Traders the people that are okay with the risk of crypto but that also want to get the upside the 10x maybe the 100x upsides and so that then explains why the best performing categories within crypto are all memec coin related despite the overall altcoin Market not doing that well the middle is simply just shrinking the def5 protocols the game five protocols the infrastructure place they are all bleeding against Bitcoin and so yes I do believe that Bitcoin dominance is going to increase but I also believe that the mem coin trading is likely going to continue the question is does it make sense then to buy shr now this is where we are right now the price is at 14.7 and after a massive rally we have seen a correction of 43% roughly now here's a data point I always like to look at I like to look at what is causing the current decline in the last 24 hours and we can see this data very clearly on Deck screener we can see the number of buyers versus the number of Sellers and at the same time we can see the buying volume versus the selling volume now what this here indicates is that since there are more buyers than Sellers and since the buying volume isn't as high that it's the larger wallets that are currently selling and that it's small wallets that are buying in in other words that's probably still profit taking from this initial run in the last 10 days we still after this crash went up by more than 3,000% and so to find out whether or not makes sense to buy the shr token now we can't just look at the website right the website is something everybody looks at we want to get an edge in the market we want to look at the data most people do not have access to that's why we look deeper into the blockchain now before we look at the analytics I always like to make a first pre-check and that is are potentially the social analytics manipulated so let's compare the numbers on on the xplatform formerly Twitter we've got roughly 4,000 followers on telegram we've got 6,000 members and on chain we've got a bit over 7,000 holders so all those numbers somewhat align it makes sense it's not like the Twitter account has 10 times the number of holders on chain so this seems to be all legitimate now let's go into the onchain data and there is a first surprise what we see over here is the number of small retail investors versus the number of large whale investors so the way this is segregated is by minimum holding thresholds so the Wallets on the left have at least 7,000 sh tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we've got 1,000 token so that's not $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got $100,000 worth of the token now of course it does make sense that the price increase aligns with the number of holders but there is something funny here right the number of retail investors roughly tripled in the last few days the number of medium-sized retail investors roughly doubled but check out the whales the whales also increased in the first run but they didn't move whatsoever in the second run so what we see over here are alltime charts this is when the token started trading what we see over here are the exact same kind of thresholds but only for the last month and again we can see very clearly quite a lot of growth by small investors a bit less growth by mediumsized and zero growth in the number of whale wallets when did the second rally start it was on the 10th of November so let's look at the long-term logarithmic chart again the 10th of November was over here so what seems to have happened is that all wallet cohorts bought into this first R especially the Wales the second wave though the second runup was not supported by the Wales and they might be the ones that are currently taking profit they might be the reason why we are down by more than 40% now we can see those two waves also very nicely in the following charts on the left side we see the number of buyers and sellers per day on the right side that's normalized to 100% per day and so this was the initial token launch this is when a lot of the Wales bought in and this is now when retail joined the party and when the whales tend to potentially offload now the ratio between buyers and sellers hasn't really changed that much it slightly now skews more towards the buyers which kind of makes sense right there is a buyer overhang but not that much of a price increase because the sellers move more Capital than the buyers do now I always like to look at the number of new users as well at the number of new users versus recurring users for a specific token because if more people adopt a token then the whales are unlikely going to sell as well the price action is dictated by the Wales but they definitely follow what retail is doing as well if retail continues to buy they keep on holding now on the left side we see the number of new users over time we've got our first rally on the 3rd of November and then we've got our buildup by retail now the problem is that that buildup seems to be slowing down a bit so on the 15th and on the 16th we have seen less buyers we can also see that on those two days the number of returning users outpace the number of new users on the day with a lot of new Adoption on that 14th of November M we almost saw a flippening happening as in more new users than returning users trading the token on a day now not everything is bad for the shr token because even though the whales tend to not buy anymore and the retail demand is somewhat slowing down there is still quite a bit of upside because have a look at this table this is the trending tokens on the ethereum Chain ordered by liquidity and we can't find shrub that quickly we have to scroll quite a bit down to find it it's at place number 32 it's got a liquidity of 2.6 million so we could easily do another 2x 3x maybe even 4X and we would then be at levels of liquidity similar to SPX or pipcoin or wck now the art in crypto is to be early right to not be the exit liquidity of others it's to find tokens before they Trend and we all know how the mem coins are now the most trending category for example over here the pump fun ecosystem this is the launch pad of meme coins on Solana over here we've got the peanut token which went up by a000 700% and is now at a market cap of 1.6 billion the upside potential for a token at 1.6 billion is of course not the same compared to when it's just at 100 million how was I able to publish a video on Peanut that early so that was more than 10 days ago and initially nobody was interested only after the price ried people watched the video at the time we are still at 11 cents and now even after the recent correction we are still at $1.70 the answer to those questions is wallet tracking I like to track other influencers I like to track other top Traders I like to track people that move markets and the nice thing about the blockchain is that transactions are transparent when you know who owns what wallet you also know who buys and sells what at what time for example check out this alert Crypt Benta bought the peanut token at only 3 cents so that was over here since then the price went up by more than 5,000% now who is Crypt bter crypt bter is one of the largest crypto channels in of YouTube so here's the page Crypt vent has 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token of course the token goes up and the alpha in all of this is to actually find those wallets that's the hard part and so we are tracking 33 of Crypt bent's wallets and so this is I believe a way better strategy than to simply just pick random meme coins in a list it's to actually follow the people that tended to make the right calls in the past it's to follow the Insiders to follow the people that actually move markets I believe in the strategy that much that I've made a dedicated tutorial section just on that topic so here are eight videos on how to find influencer wallets how to track influencer wallets and how to then interpret the signals that we get from the tracking now this is all part of Premium premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at at the beginning of this video it's also about risk mitigation it's also about back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total for premium now once we've got a wallet signal we also need to discuss when to buy when to sell that's why there are dedicated altcoin Chats on the individual altcoins in premium as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a one week money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it still make sense to buy shr yes there is some upside potential but on the other hand I also see a lot of wals that are currently dumping and I don't know how much longer they will dump if we see again another wave of retail investors they probably continue to take profit I think there are better more natural rallies out there that don't have that much whale ownership if you got some value out video feel free to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in

Tokenomics,  #goat #goatseusmaximus  #crypto","crypto is all about meme coins or to be more specific about meme coins on Solana or to be even more specific about mem coins in the pump. fun ecosystem now the pump. fun tokens in general performed pretty well in the last week it's the second best performing category in all of crypto the only category that did better was AI memes and within the pump. fun ecosystem the largest token is of course Goos maximos or the go token now how much potential upside is there still let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's see who's buying here and who's selling here and how much longer this current rally can last now the go token isn't just the largest of the pump. fund tokens it's the largest of all trending tokens on Solana at least when measured by the liquidity pool size the second largest is mudang with half of the liquidity pool mudang by the way is also coming from the pump. fun ecosystem and so let's have a look at that on data let's look behind the curtain I don't just like to look at Price data right A lot of people simply draw random lines on price charts but then we don't really know what drives the prices the nice thing about the blockchain is that everything is transparent we can see onchain if it's large holders that are buying or if it's small retail that it's buying now let's first have a look at how quickly the investor base is growing because especially with mem coins it's important that more and more new people come in in order to stabilize the price at a high level what we see on the left is the the number of firsttime Traders on Solana for the gold token over time so each bar here represents an individual day we pecked out on the second day after launch since then we are declining and unfortunately that decline seems to accelerate somewhat now let's compare this to the number of recurring Traders we can see that up until the 17th of October the number of firsttime Traders exceeded the number of recurring Traders now the 17th of October is over here here so we did not stop with our rally we still doubled in the price afterwards but we have then seen a sharp decline of firsttime Traders and a massive Delta to the recurring Traders on the 25th and the 25th is over here so since then we have not seen a lot of price depreciation we also see how momentum tends to slow down somewhat right the number of token transactions per day here shown on the right is also declining and that's of course a problem because the higher the market cap is the more money it takes to push the price higher if the momentum is slowing down at the same time the market cap is still high that's not that great now before we look at the trader segregation numbers one more thing I've talked about the gold token already very early on this channel the first video was 11 days ago and I'm continuing to cover goat now that video over here it was published when goat was still at 26 Cents so that was over here since then we went up by 140% in the top even by 230% roughly and so I publish videos regularly on this channel especially discussing meme coins with their onchain analytics Fe feat to subscribe I try to be early and I try to make money for all of us now let's go back to gold and the onchain analytics what we see on the left is the trading volume measured in US dollar split by Trader segment so in Gray we've got small retail that's all the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to $10,000 large retail is up to $100,000 and the Wales is above $100,000 worth of the token now we see how trading volume built up and is now coming down it peaked on the 21st of October the 21st of October by the way was a day where we saw a crash and a turnaround more on that in a second we see however how small retail tended to Peak later on the 24th of October so again that's over here and when the trading volume by small retail is peing that's usually not a good sign because why do the Wales hold a token they hold it in order to then sell it afterwards to retail right this is how crypto Works crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the Wales they obviously have more skill because they' have got more money they had some positive trades in the past now when those whales see that small retail isn't buying anymore then they might dump as well right the way it's in the end dictate where the price is going they've got most of the token but they sell once the adoption once once the exit liquidity doesn't flow in anymore and it appears as if we are at that point on the right we see the trading volume normalized to 100% And we see that less and less trading volume is now done by the Wales and we see how small retail and mediumsized Retail is now taking over starting to hold the bag and so we can simply have a look at the number of investors based on minimum holding threshold so on the left side we've got retail on the right we've got the Wales so this time we don't split this by us amounts this time we split this by a minimum holding in terms of number of tokens on the left side it's 2,000 tokens at the kind price that's a bit over $11,000 then we've got $10,000 worth of the token in the middle and 100 on the right the Wales are taking profit medium-sized retail sells slowly and small retail isn't buying anymore and so really it's about being early it's about the timing it's about buying where not a lot of other people know about it it's not about the quality of the project it's really just about hype it's about momentum and when momentum slows down it tends to move to the next opportunity so from the prior videos you probably already know goat was launched in the whole context of an AI the terminal of truths that Twitter account has now 200,000 followers and people are looking for the next opportunity here so one way to catch a wave early is to follow this Twitter account very very closely now we could simply look at the wallet and see what is that wallet currently holding unfortunately tokens like tartle or Planet AI don't have a lot of liquidity so it seems like the AI is making millions and millions of dollars but unfortunately those tokens can't be sold the liquidity pools are just a few thousand worth so don't buy ttle don't buy Plan AI but another potential approach to make money is to look at what kind of wallets made a lot of money with gold so there are several wallets that made more than a million dollar of profit and there are hundreds of wallets that made more than $100,000 worth with the goat rally alone now how did I know about goat so early I knew about early because I track wallets I look at wallets of successful Traders as we have seen but I also look at other influencers because influencers very often buy a token and then afterwards promote it on the YouTube channel and once it's promoted on YouTube then a lot of other people buy the token as well right attention means higher prices and so have a look at this that's our wallet tracker in premium we see how Kyle chesse sold his MIT token at a price of 29 cents and how he then subsequently bought goat at 14 cents MIT went down since he sold so from 29 to 25 and we all know what happened to the gold token right a multiple X return and so here's that influencer he's got 133,000 subscribers and we are tracking 12 of his wallets but in total we've got 419 wallets and yes not every signal here is profitable but still I believe this is the right approach approach to short list the tokens to potentially buy and sell and so that's why in premium we've also got dedicated Chats on individual all coins that all runs in telegram feel free to check it out it's down below it's the bitcoin.com there's even an entire video course on how to find Wallets on how to track them and on how to then interpret the signals that we get from tracking so that's over here that's eight videos and besides wallet tracking of course the micro is important portfolio management is important risk management is important there's more than 100 tutorial videos in premium again there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply message me within the first week and I refund you 100% so again to sum it all up it's all about timing you want to be early it looks like the momentum for gold is slowing down it looks like retail isn't buying that much anymore so I'm now looking for the next thing I don't have a crystal ball either I don't know where the price will go but I do believe there's better risk to reward place out there than the gold token if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQuohpY2Z-w,"['Solana', 'Flow', 'JUST', 'Threshold',

FI application 300 million of the total 680 million are just in that single application but when we have a look at the actual application there isn't that much trading volume here 10 million for the most active of the liquidity pools in the last 24 hours compare this with the trading volume on ethereum that's 1.6 billion so 160 times the size have a look at the trading volume on Solana 1.7 billion same magnitude check out the binance smart chain 600 million so for whatever reason the total value locked on Solana relative to ton is only eight times the size but the trading volumes that we can actually see on the most used decentralized application it's not just eight times smaller it's 170 times smaller some numbers seem to be inflated here the number of active accounts I believe isn't that accurate either because again that's the beauty of the blockchain we can have a look at the transactions to the ton Network for example how much capital is getting bridged from say ethereum over to ton we don't have the best onchain analytics for ton but we do have them for ethereum have a look at this this is a ton ethereum Bridge addresses how many addresses or how many wallets have bridged over 2 ton on a given day and this hovers around 100 Maybe speaking at around 300 wallets per day but that's the entire magnitude that's a far cry from the millions of accounts that get created every month have a look at the dollars that get bridged over from ethereum to ton yes there are weeks where millions of dollars get bridged the peak was at roughly 3 million in the second week of April of this year but again this is a far cry from those $680 million total value lock it's not Capital that's flowing in from ethereum for sure now there's different ways to own ton right you can buy the ton coin on the centralized exchange this is what most people do you can also buy the bridged versions on ethereum and on the binance smart chain so there are equivalent tokens on Eve and on the BC and the good news is that we can dive into those statistics very transparently on chain so on ethereum we've got 28,000 holders of ton coin on the B B smart chain we've got 68,000 holders so it appears as if there's more Capital even on the binance smart chain compared to ethereum but this is only the first impression and that impression is actually wrong let me show you a bit of a complex setup of charts I know at the beginning it can be a bit overwhelming but I'll walk you through this what we see here is ethereum data so how many holders are there over time for the ethereum based ton token and we've got this since Inception that's the first line over here and we've got this only for the last month that's the second line now there are minimum holding thresholds to be counted in those graphs for the left charts you have to hold at least 100 ton tokens to be counted but at the current price that's roughly $600 that's what I'd consider retail but the chart in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's a minimum of 1,000 tokens so that's now $6,000 for the right chart we go another 10x that's now at least 60 ,000 that's what I'd consider Wales long-term all wallet cohorts seem to be buying in the last month it was mainly small retail that accumulated medium-sized retail and Wales didn't do much here are the same kind of charts but not for the ethereum chain but for the binance smart chain here we can see that the whales are actually exiting we can also see that the number of retail investors isn't growing since April of 2022 so everybody that's buying ton on chain seems to be doing this on the ethereum Chain not on the binance smart chain but here's the interesting part there seems to be hidden sell pressure because the number of whales that is shrinking over here is offsetting pretty much the number of whales that grow over here right so on the ethereum Chain Wales enter on the Bing smart chain Wales exit but those two effects are pretty much offsetting each other for medium-sized retail and for small retail we rather see growth now the growth is not massive but it is exist now when the number of small retail wallets is growing by 5 to 10% in the last month why did the price of ton then go down by 20% while at the same time Bitcoin simply didn't move at all and ethereum went down only by 10% why did ton underperform that much we can't see it on chain and it also doesn't seem to be token inflation at least officially is $6 here actually the bottom is ton potentially now a good buy let's check out relative valuation charts let's not just look at the US dollar chart but at relative valuation to ethereum because ethereum is obviously the largest competitor with its own smart contract platform this is ton relative to e and it's interesting how this is pumping and dumping relatively predictably there is a pretty clear trading range and unfortunately we are pretty high on that trading range the potential gain is maybe 20 or 21% the potential loss though is 60% maybe even 65% ton is very much dominated by centralized exchange trading most trading volume happens on okx bybit Mexi Etc and we've also got Perpetual Futures again on bybit and on okx but binance is also part of the party and so maybe the selling pressure might be coming from those centralized exchanges maybe they got some ton and most people aren't aware of that allocation there is a an article that discusses this fear free to Google that article it's on medium it's titled ton blockchain a group of related whales mined 85% of ton Supply that article came out in March of 20123 so fear free to check it out it's something that might explain why we see this massive volatility in the price relative to ethereum from time to time while in terms of adoption in terms of numbers of wallets we actually see relatively constant growth why would the price of ton suddenly dump relative to e by 70% when there's more and more people jumping on the investment the only explanation I have is that some whales on those centralized exchanges are Distributing I know critical reviews on cryptocurrencies don't necessarily get thumbs up because everybody wants to hear their investment do well but I try to keep it as real as possible if you appreciate this feel free to give it a thumbs up and feel free free to also subscribe I publish videos regularly

WE DO NOT TRADE  HERE.  üü° This live stream displays a trading chart. It's a standard chart, but unlike other platforms, it's modified to show the current market developments in a simple form and easy to understand.  üü° The purpose of this live broadcast is to teach you  basic rules and has an educational nature.

Orange rectangles represent demand zone.  2, Enter a potential trade in demand or supply zones: When the price enters an orange zone (demand), check if your indicator generates a BUY SIGNAL, which could be a potential signal to buy.  When the price enters a green zone (supply), check if your indicator generates a SELL SIGNAL, which could be a potential signal to sell.  3, Enter only with confirmation from supply and demand zones: Before entering a trade, confirm that the BUY SIGNAL or SELL SIGNAL aligns with the current supply or demand zone. The signal is stronger when it is closer to the zone, and it's recommended to use signals that are directly within the zones. This provides a more robust confirmation of the potential trade setup.  4, Risk management.  Determine the amount of risk for each trade and adhere to risk management principles. ALWAYS Set a stop-loss to minimize losses.  5, Experiment on a demo account: Learn and  Experiment with it on a demo accounts do not use real money to better understand its behavior.  6, Watch for potential divergences: Monitor situations where the price enters a supply or demand zone, but the indicator does not provide a corresponding signal. This may indicate a potential divergence and requires caution.  7, Monitor macroeconomic events: Stay informed about macroeconomic events that could impact the market, as such events may influence the effectiveness of the indicator.  üö©SIGNAL CONFIRMATION RULE: Market conditions change every second.  It is crucial to wait for the signal candle to close to confirm the validity of the signal.  Patience is key, as the signal may disappear if not confirmed by the closing of the candle.

videos tend to outperform average videos in other words there is a lot of retail interest for Dogecoin now does that mean that also the price will go further up from here let's have a look at some data most people are not considering now let me give you an insight into the YouTube statistics here here's a Dogecoin video published 15 days ago and the average video is here in Gray This is normally how an average video per performs and in blue is what that Dogecoin video performed it made 4.7 times more views than an average video another Dogecoin video followed 2.1 times more views and here's another one 3.2 times 2.6 times and 3.3 times and so what's going on with all of that retail interest why are so many people suddenly interested in Doge of course the price of Doge went up but probably the main question everybody's mind is how much higher can Dogecoin get from here because that's the general game with crypto right we Tred to figure out the expected value of a bet we try to find out what's a potential upside but also what's a potential risk and How likely are those two scenarios going to happen thus nobody knows for sure where something will go right nobody can predict prices but we can figure out if currently a bet makes sense or it's rather better to stay away now Dogecoin is the largest of the mem coins in all of crypto and the mcoin market is huge so the market cap of all of Doge is approaching 60 billion and the number two with which is Sheba Eno has only a fourth of that size the newest Joiner in the top 10 is Peanut and that has only 160th of the size when we look at all the meme coins that are listed in coin gecko we've got more than 3,000 tokens of course outside of coin gecko there are tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of meme coins and so Dogecoin is number one how much higher can it potentially go when we simply just compare market caps here are the largest cryptocurrencies overall not just the mcoin market market and there Dogecoin is at number seven let's say we speculate on Dogecoin hitting $1 what would be the market cap it would be 2.5x the current market cap which puts it at 147 billion so even above the largest of the stable coins tether also above Solana only Bitcoin and ethereum would be larger than Doge and so that's definitely a very optimistic scenario right I'm not saying it cannot happen but I do think that simply just in terms of outperformance the rest of the market a 2.5x is not that easily achievable now most retail investors they tend to buy an altcoin and then hold it for the very long term hoping that it will appreciate the very large investors the Wales they tend to buy and sell much more actively now let's go back in time let's have a look at many many years ago when Dogecoin just launched how was it at that time relative to other cryptocurrencies there's a very interesting website and that is coinmarketcap.com slh hisorical on that website we can see the crypto rankings at different points in time it starts in 2013 and of course goes all the way to today and this is a very nice reminder of History let's go to the beginning of Doge in December of 2013 this is how the top 100 looked at that point in time no surprise of course Bitcoin is at number one there is a bit of a surprise Litecoin is at number two ethereum wasn't yet around and where do we have Dogecoin we've got Dogecoin at number 15 so relatively speaking Dogecoin climbed up the ladder again now it's at number seven but here is I believe a very important takeaway from this table just have a look at those names over here how many of those names do you actually recognize do you still recognize NXT or namecoin or quar or bitshares the worldcoin is not the world coin we know today this is another world coin we've got mega coin Prime coin infinite coin feathercoin and yes we do have here our Dogecoin but just have a look at this list right you probably don't remember a lot of those kinds of cryptocurrencies 90% 95% maybe even more got completely forgotten and so this tells us that maybe buying and holding a cryptocurrency over many many years an altcoin not necessarily Bitcoin but an altcoin over many many years is a very risky Endeavor but then there's the counterargument and that counterargument is over here right this is Dogecoin over the very long term if you bet on the right token of course you can make nice money let's have a look at the chart in logarithmic form since launch Dogecoin went up by 178,000 per. at the same time though Bitcoin also went up so the question is did we get enough outperformance to compensate for say 90% of losers or maybe even 95% of losers what we have got over here is again this long-term chart but this time we divide the do price price by the Bitcoin price so we look at the long-term outperformance relative to bitcoin how much more performance it we get by buying Dogecoin compared to just buying Bitcoin and the answer is over here the outperformance is 1,100% a 10x a bit more than that and that happened with a lot of volatility right we tend to be trading in somewhat of a range and now we are somewhere in the middle of the upper range here it is interesting how those bottoms align quite nicely here right it seems like there's some kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy effect maybe enough people are watching charts like this but then again right let's work with this bullish case let's say we hit the upper bound of that trading range that would be an appreciation of 170% or the magical 2.5x roughly that we already talked about that's probably not hyper likely at least longterm could we get there a day or two potentially is it worth the risk I'm not sure it seems like most of the time when we show shot up that quickly as we have recently we tended to rather trickle downward subsequently now here's another way to look at this this is the Dogecoin dominance so dominance simply just looks at how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap the entire cryptocurrency space is now tied up in Doge or another way to phrase this how important is Dogecoin relative to all of crypto right now and unfortunately this chart doesn't go that far back into the past but still we are now at very similar levels to what we had seen in October of 22 and the best case upside is maybe plus 100% a bit more than that since that recent rally even though the Dogecoin price went up it did not outperform since the 13th of November now the crypto Market as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly and I like to look at the stable coin market cap to determine whether or not we're currently in the bull market or in a bare market and that is the chart we see over here sometimes we see the stable coin market cap going up sometimes we see it going down and the reason why I like this chart so much is because it has very little volatility right it doesn't go tically up and down like the Bitcoin price or like the Dogecoin price it has very clear Trends what happened over here was the defi collapse of the anchor protocol right so this is when Terra Luna went bus this is when the US stable coin depack this is when a lot of people withdrew money from crypto it started a whole Bare market and during that bare Market Bitcoin went from 69k all the way down to 16k and also FTX collapsed during that bare Market since October of last year we see an expansion of the stablecoin market cap again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the reason why this chart is so useful is not just because we can see clearly the trend where currently the crypto Market is at what's also nice about it is that we can deterministically say that currently money is flowing into crypto as in traditional Finance the traditional Finance world is moving Fiat into the crypto space because whenever this is going up this means that you send for example your US dollars to binance and binance then sends this to a custodian of stable coins let's say tether tether then takes custody of your money right it puts it in some kind of bank account or in some kind of bonds and then mins the tokens on the blockchain and we can see the tether minting here in this chart and so the exact opposite happens when this is going down this is when you withdraw your fiat currency from binance and so I think there's roughly 177 billion reasons to believe that the price of crypto is likely going to continue to rise from here all of crypto and so this is what I mean with all of crypto right crypto is highly correlated to one another when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well but they don't go up to the same degree here are the top 100 alt coins in the last 7 Days ordered by their performance and the best performer was Stella with a bit over 100% but have a look at this this is the best performing meme coins in the last s days and we've got chill guy with more than 3,000% in the last 7 days we talked about chill guy several times on this channel but we also talked about the goat token several times on this channel when it was still very very cheap now goat is the largest of the meme coins on the Solana blockchain that had been launched with pump. fun so pump. fun is the Launchpad of meme coins on Solana there's a lot of trading happening over there and goat has the largest market cap now I made a video on Goat when it was still at 24 cents that was on the 16th of October subsequently the price went up by more than 500% now recently it came down again a bit and so I try to find tokens that currently have positive momentum that still have a lot of upside potential tokens that can still do the 3 four five xes that are probably not possible anymore with the larger tokens so if you're interested in being early in those kind of bets then feel fre you to subscribe to this channel right I publish videos regularly here now how did I find out about the go token for example that early the answer is wallet tracking have a look at this influencer Kyle Chessie bought the gold token already at 14 cents so that was over here subsequently the price went up by more than 800% now what is wallet tracking the blockchain is completely transparent right we can see who's buying who's selling the only difficult part is to find out what are the wallets that are important who owns what kind of wallets what kind of wallets actually make money and so here is Kyle chesse he's got more than 130,000 subscribers he's the person that bought gold early and so through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets we always get a signal when he's buying or selling something I have a look at this alert from today bankless bought the clanker token for $53 since then the price went up by 57% again that's in a matter of a few hours and have a look at this below right this is the onchain analytics that one of our moderators performed on The Token here's the bankless channel they've got almost a quarter of a million subscribers and of course when they talk about a token this generates a lot of attention and attention then means purchases and purchases mean a rising price we only have two of Bank L's wallets but we try to find more again we use onch analytics and we have our people in the chats that use various methods to find wallets of people that move markets I want to share one more trade and it's probably the most impressive of the trades because it turns a micro cap into a pretty large pump and dump this was on November 23rd the martini guy bought the moon token on pump fun right we already talked about pump. fun and he did this at a price of 412 this is how that developed once it got traded on radium it red up by more than 1,000% now it's at 4 34 so even after the dump we are still up by roughly 3x that's how early those kind of signals are here is the martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers roughly and here are the wallets that we Track by this guy 12 in total we now have exactly 500 wallets in our tracking so it's not just the three influencers that I just mentioned we've got way more and so this is I believe the real way to make money in crypto right you want to know things that most people don't know how else can you buy lower than others and sell higher than others if you don't have a market Edge if you don't know more than others it's better to be very closely to the people that buy early and then potentially sell when all the masses come and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it is eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to set up the tracking for the influencer wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell what are the current onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month the price will increase next week so you can lock in still this old price and keep that old price there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you do not like premium just message me within the first first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so it does it make sense to keep on holding Dogecoin potentially right the overall crypto Market is expanding so the US dollar price of Doge is likely going to go up as well will it continue to outperform bitcoin I'm not so sure I think the best risk to reward is now in other place it's especially in the smaller meme coins if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I probably youly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

Cryptos I&#39;m Buying Before they Explode! #cryptocurrency #altcoins #crypto,This is a short list of altcoins I'm buying before they explode. I believe these coins have a higher chance of outperforming bitcoin before the end of the crypto bull run.,at the start of the year I began tracking 11 specific coins while many have already rallied some are still building up for their big move so far only Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high salana jasmi and render have performed well year-to dat with salana even reclaiming its 52- we highs meanwhile cardano and xrp have started pumping and seem poised to continue their upward momentum however Avalanche Gala hadera polka dot and ethereum have yet to show significant progress for this reason I plan to keep accumulating these coins in the coming days stopping only once they recover their 52e highs Avalanche polka dot and hadera are currently trading at roughly 2x below their 52- we highs while Gala lags further behind needing nearly a 3X move to reclaim its 52- we High,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxNpm_Htbs,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Cardano', 'Avalanche', 'Render', 'Gala']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WqxNpm_Htbs/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-15T16:17:18Z

already very large when we look at mcoin trading bread is the largest one on the base chain now does it make sense to buy bread right now it was bleeding quite a bit with the rest of the mem coin Market in the last week does it make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at some onchain metrics to see whether or not there's long-term adoption and whether or not it makes sense to take potential opportunity here now Bas has seen quite a bit of adoption its total value lock is 2.4 billion and its trend is pretty consistent it's the sixth largest chain in terms of tvl and it's the fourth largest chain in terms of bridged total value locked and so it appears as if recently all of defi is rather taking a breather right now Bas is not taking a breather now here are the top trending tokens on base and of course we've got the newly issued coinbase Bitcoin but we've also got Aerodrome Aerodrome with a liquidity of 130 million and we've got the largest of the meme coins red with only a liquidity pool of 8.2 million note how the base chain has much less meme coins compared to Solana with Solana every single trending token is now a mem coin now we're currently at 7.8 cents we are down more than 20% this week and that's happening while Bitcoin barely moved it only went down by 3% and so since listing on coin market cap Brett doubled roughly it's up 101% however it's all about being early when we look at the liquidity pool when we look at when Brett actually started trading on the base chain we see very very different gains in the first few days Brett appreciated by more than 30,000 per. and so is this a potential opportunity now are we potentially seeing a flaw here let's look at the onchain analytics in a second let's dive into the individual transactions in a moment I first want to share my statistics around YouTube for Brett because I published various videos on the token already on this channel so there's six videos on Brett on this channel one of them had been a rock pool so Chinese Brad we identified this in the video as well I hope nobody got burned by this the warning in the video was pretty clear it was a training token at the time but have a look at the number of views it started off with 7,000 it stayed at 7,000 then 45,000 then 8,000 and the recent video has a bit fewer views but it's also the newest of the videos it's still on average an outperformer so the average video is in gray that recent video is in blue in other words it seems like there is still a lot of consistent retail interest the number of views over time isn't really declining and even the recently published video is outperforming now let's get into the meat of this channel I like to look at onchain data regularly over here let's look at what all of those hundreds of thousands of holders are doing on the base chain we've got almost 700,000 holders but not all of them are created equally some of them might just have a few cents worth of the token so let's introduce some minimum holding thresholds on the on the left side we've got the number of wallets over time that have at least 10,000 bread tokens so at the current price that's $780 that's what I consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's another 10x in minimal holding so roughly $88,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's $18,000 worth of the token it seems like the Wales pretty much stopped accumulating medium-sized retail buys a little bit it seems like the smallest of the wallets by the fastest now what does that mean we're currently at 35,5 500 wallets 1 month from now we were at 35,3 so we grew by less than 1% in the course of a month we see growth but not very quick growth so there's some kind of a stagnation in the adoption on top of that we also see how trading volume seems to be dominated by the centralized exchanges because a lot of the trading volume happens via Bots via returning users this is something we don't see that often on chain we see more than 85% of trading volume on a day by return returning users not by new users and so here's the spot trading volume just ordered by the different exchanges we don't even see Aerodrome or Unis swap over here we also see quite a bit of activity on the bets on the price via Perpetual Futures the number of buyers and sellers per day is also on a rather low level historically and so I'm personally not surprised by this I have the impression Brett is simply too large I have the impression that the market currently is splitting what we've got over here is the others dominance so this is is how much of all of crypto is currently in the altcoins that are not in the top 10 and since beginning of the year this tends to rather go down at the same time we see how the Bitcoin dominance is going up and that's because of the positive inflows into the Bitcoin ETF there is a split Happening Here There is one part of the investor base that simply just wants to get exposure to crypto and it just buys the hardest of the assets that buys Bitcoin either directly on chain or indirectly through the ETF and then there's the other part of investors that want to get the 10x the 100x returns and when then a market cap of a meme coin gets too large there is no more 10 or 100x so it's either about allocating to the largest asset to bitcoin or it's about buying the very small assets the middle is shrinking away the defi protocols that have very large market caps or the meme coins that are in the hundreds of millions have a comparatively harder time because check this out when we order by market cap in the last 7 days all the meme coins lost but when we look at the meme coins that appreciated in the last 7 days all of them are rather small in market cap there's only two that are above 100 million the other meme coins that gained are only in the T of millions and again Brett has a market cap of 700 million it can that easily 10x from here it's all about being early it's all about buying when a token has freshly launched and it's not about buying when there's already hundreds of millions of market cap and so then there's the big question right how can we identify such tokens early before they are big and my answer to this is wallet tracking I like to track wallets of influencers and of traders that have a good record check this out this is part of Premium so there's a premium membership of this Channel and this is the influencer trade Channel and we see here how the Dogecoin millionaire bought some bread we see how cryptol lifter bought some bread we see how handsome Finance bought bread and those kind of signals started off in the middle of March already and so we've got 12 wallets by Alex specka not all of those wallets are welln we've got 33 wallets by Crypt Benta a Channel with more than a million subscribers we've got 55 wallets of crypto gains who does have quite a bit of influence on small cap cryptocurrencies I find the topic so important that I created a dedicated video tutorial course so there's eight videos on how to find different influencer Wallets on how to track them and how to then afterwards analyze and interpret those signals that we get from the tracking there's not just wallet tracking videos there's more than 100 videos in total there's also videos about risk management portfolio management blockchain analytics Etc of course there also dedicated Chats on when to buy and sell for the different alt coins we also discuss the onchain metrics over there and I share my own trades as well for example here this ethereum short that I opened recently and there are regularly published videos on the market as a whole as well so feel free to check it out it's $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% so again I think the opportunity now is not in bread it might be on Bas base continues to grow but it's probably rather in the smaller meme coins that still see adoption Bret doesn't really see accumulation that's quick enough if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I apolog you a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

fascinating in a market of calmness where pretty much nothing is going up one token one mem coin is standing out and that's Maga or Mega make America great again the Trump meme coin now let's have a look at what's driving this R let's have a look at who's buying here is this small retail or is this the large whale investors let's look at the data most people are not considering so today we are up by 33% we are above $6 now so that's the chart today but since listing on coin market cap in the middle of August of last year we went up by more than 36,000 per. and the nice thing about this meme coin is that pretty much all of the supply is circulating so there is no more Supply expansion no more potential additional tokens that could hit the market rewarding the early team the early buyers this is a pretty fair player versus player game and so in the last 6 hours Trump was one of the most traded tokens directly on the ethereum chain and this is the long-term chart in wrapped ethereum because this is fundamentally very important to understand altcoins are closely tied to the price of ethereum because altcoins are pulled with reped ethereum so when ethereum goes down Say by 10% then altcoins in general also go down by 10% because altcoins are priced in ethereum not in US Dollars and so we have to also look at relative performance to ethereum this is not a US dollar chart this is a ethereum chart and what's nice about this is is that even though this is a risky meme coin it tends to not underperform ethereum when attention is low very often we see massive sell-offs whenever attention is low whenever trading volume is low there is of course volatility here as well so temporarily a drop of 60% but given that the market cap is relatively large and given that the market in general isn't super hyped in the last weeks seeing that the Trump token stays somewhat stable versus ethereum is a positive thing and we are just starting again a potential next rally of attention right we've just peaked in trading volume again if we see further trading volume increases and the price is likely going to also continue to rise potentially creating a new all-time high denominated in wrapped ethereum now let's have a look at the onchain data let's have a look at who's buying and selling here let's check out if it's the whales that are manipulating the price or if retail is actually jumping on there how potentially organic is this rally because the less manipulation there is the longer a rally can last right if it's only one person that's buying in with a lot of capital then that's way less sustainable compared to when it's many many people that jump on this and so I've built a tool to make exactly that differentiation to count the number of retail investors versus whale investors so on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 150 Maga Trump tokens so that's now more than 6,000 people there's pretty much a constant GR growth of retail investors here retail in aggregate doesn't sell tokens they simply just buy it in the middle we've got medium-sized retail so that's now a 10x in minimum holding that's 1,500 tokens that the current price that's roughly $10,000 so we've got $1,000 on the left $10,000 in the middle and on the right we've got the Wales that's now a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the mega token isn't that interesting the Wales stopped accumulating already in the middle of January the number of retail wallets roughly tripled since the middle of January let's have a look at the price since the middle of January it's going up it pretty much made a 20x so clearly the token is driven by retail demand it's not driven by the Wales and so in the last month ethereum went down by 19% but the mega Trump token went up by 1.5% so measured in ethereum mega went up more and more people get onto the token and so here are the same charts that we just looked at before but only for the last month again retail continues to accumulate very steadily and now is even stepping up the game with the recent rally same for mediumsized retail and also the whales they are not selling they are following suit and so the nice thing about this token is that it's not yet dominated by the centralized exchanges again if a lot of tokens are held by centralized exchanges there might be manipulation but in our case 70% of all of trading volume happens on Unis swap directly on the ethereum chain it's very good because this tells us that the statistics that we have here and here are very reliable there is one thing that might overshadow all of this and that's this chart over here this is the market cap of all stable coins unfortunately that's not growing in the last two weeks so we seem to be now at a phase in the market where no more capital is flowing in where we're not going to see increased prices just because more more people more and more Capital deposit Fiat on those centralized exchanges that then turn into stable coins so when this is going up that's great for altcoins because more capital is being deployed when this going sideways we're simply just in a sideways market and that could then of course also hurt meme coins like Mega so instead of betting on the US dollar price further going up maybe it makes sense to short ethereum at the same time and just bet on the reped ethereum price going up so you want to be buying Trump with borrowed reped ethereum not directly with stable coins if you don't know how to do this feel free to check out premium there's a dedicated video on how to

Tokenomics,  #Worldcoin #wld #crypto","everybody was bashing on worldcoin on the wld token upon launch now the price action has changed why is that let's have a look at data most people are not considering let's dive into the onchain metrics as in who's currently buying is the small retail is this the Wales is this everyone do we only have manipulation here or do we actually have something fundamental going on so let's find out how much longer this R can last worldcoin was the best performer in the top 100 in the last week it went up by 177% today we are at $615 the gain in the last week is 33% and since launch in July of last year the price more than tripled of course with a lot of ups and downs why do we suddenly see this rally recently it's probably not due to leverage right now the market is rather calm pretty much no asset currently has high borrowing costs and that's a trend we already see for quite a while but check this out this is the okx data and it looks at the open position value in Perpetual Futures and worldcoin is pretty high up the list given that in terms of market cap it's only at rank 74 so where is all that speculation coming from why do we currently see this rally is this manipulation to answer this question I always like to look onchain I like to look at the transactions directly on the blockchain there is of course also trading happening on the centralized exchanges but we can't really look into those centralized exchanges they are pretty much black boxes but the blockchain is transparent on the blockchain we can see how much trading activity is there is this currently the large wallets that are accumulating is this the number of retail investors that is growing what's actually driving the price so there are two versions of the token there is one token on the ethereum blockchain according to Ether scan we've got 21,000 holders of the ethereum based worldcoin token we've got another version of the token on optimism so that's a layer two on top of ethereum here we've got 3.6 million holders now this looks like the wld token has way more capital on optimism than directly on ethereum but that's actually not true check out the following this is ethereum and optimism the number of holders over time this is by the way a tool that I've developed myself that I make available to the premium members feel free to check out the premium membership you can pluck in any token in this tool on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 200 wld tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail and this is a one month chart so the number of retail wallets grew by roughly 15 to 20% in the last month in the middle we've got medium-sized retail here now the minimum holding threshold is a 10x from the left chart so here we need at least a bit over $10,000 to be counted in this graph the number of medium-sized retail grew by a bit more than 20% on the right side we've got the whale wallets that's now another 10x so that's more than $100,000 worth worth of wld that went from 234 to 271 holders so even more growth this is very very uncommon it's very uncommon to see accumulation across all boards especially most accumulation by the whales so there's more and more whales jumping onto wld those are the charts on the ethereum Chain here are the same charts on the optimism chain and isn't that interesting right there were way more holders millions of holders on optimism but once we put a minimal threshold here the numbers that we see for each of those charts are actually lower compared to the numbers of holders on the ethereum Chain quite interesting still we see accumulation across the board for all wallet cohorts the whales that have massive money in this don't necessarily use optimism and the reason for this is probably that the liquidity pools aren't as large on optimism so when you've got very high amounts to transfer then you rather take ethereum the gas fees don't really matter that much with those kinds of amounts if you've got smaller amounts then you tend to use optimism because you don't pay gas fees and the depth of the liquidity Pool isn't that important the slippage isn't that important when you don't move that much money still accumulation everywhere and so my impression is that this recent rally in the last 7 Days might just be the beginning because again we see this accumulation massively during the entire month but in the last month worldcoin actually didn't do that great so the price seems to be artificially depressed still why is that the case your guess is as good as mine there is of course always always the scare around the circulating supply of wld but it's very hard actually to find out how much wld is actually circulating there is very contradicting information around this if you've got very reliable information on this then please feel free to comment this down below any link to any reliable source is very much appreciated I'll show you now what I have so we've got token. unlocks doapp this does not look that pretty so according to this website we go from 1.4 billion to 3.4 billion Within a year this is very high token inflation when we look at a dune dashboard by the worldcoin team we see that the circulating Supply is actually not always growing there seems to be also some dips but since beginning of the year the circulating supply has roughly doubled when we look at another Dune dashboard we see that the number of total accounts of total new accounts has pretty much died down so where is the circulating Supply expansion coming from it seems to not be free handouts to people getting their irises scanned the market currently is very very unclear it's not very clear if you're going up or down from here there's very contradicting information the stav coin market cap isn't growing as quickly as I hope to still Bitcoin is above its best moving averages when you run back test Etc so I've got all kinds of different views on crypto as a whole that being said in case crypto recovers I believe that worldcoin does have a lot of upside potential I personally also plan on buying some World coin myself I say I plan to not I bought because I never front run you guys so I never buy a cryptocurrency beforehand to then afterwards promote it to the audience to pump and dump on the audience I don't believe that's an ethical approach to treat an audience unfortunately it's been done way more often than I'd like to see if it's your first time here feel you to

Crypto Shorting Assessing the Risks,,shorting cryptocurrencies is a strategy that can be profitable but requires caution Market participants often focus on coins that have surged sharply due to speculation or hype for instance if a token Rises by 300% in a week without clear fundamental reasons it could signal an overheated Market however shorting is always risky and analyzing bubbles like meme coins or projects with weak fundamentals is crucial before taking positions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrDDZ6Uga9s,[],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDDZ6Uga9s/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-30T15:40:41Z

Drift Review, Drift Price, Drift Price Prediction, Drift longterm, Drift Tokenomics,  #drift #crypto #altcoin","the drift protocol has a lot of things going for it the usage is increasing this is the total value locked on the Solana chain and that usage might even accelerate in the next one or two months let's have a look at The Good the Bad and the Ugly so here's one of the good things when we look at the total value lock not in US dollars but measured in Solana the growth is even more steady so all the fluctuation we can see on the US dollar chart is solely because crypto as a whole fluctuates but the adoption is pretty constant now a lot of that total value locked increase has to do with existing users so there aren't too many new users coming in at least for the Perpetual Futures product but the platform is very sticky many people that wants tried it continue to use it and so we see a pretty stable number of transactions over time we're seeing quite a few assets deposited this month and the Insurance Fund tends to grow with that now here's the bread and butter product of drift protocol it's a decentralized Perpetual Futures Trading platform on Solana so if you feel like gambling you can bet with 20x on Solana on bitcoin or on ethereum and even on some more exotic cryptocurrencies we've got even meme coins in here popcat Etc but the pital Futures is actually not what's interesting here at first glance the token looks super boring since it's airdrop in May of this year we simply just went sideways now we are at 49 but here's the kicker the focus of drift becomes now its new betting platform so check this out this is their Twitter bet on drift it's got 111,000 followers and here's the product the BET product on drift with a 52% chance that Donald Trump will win the election there is $3 million on that bet there's another 21 million on whether or not Camila Harris will win the popular vote so we've got five political bet open right now Formula 1 betting is going to come and since the presidential election will be on the 5th of November this is where I believe a lot of adoption for drift can accelerate and that might lead us to Breaking finally the sidewards trading range now one has to wonder why did the price go sideways while at the same time the usage of the platform is growing I believe the reason for that price under performance relatively speaking is twofold first of all we had a lot of receivers of the air drop that simply sold that governance token secondly the supply of drift tends to grow over time let's have a look at both let's start off with the toomics there's 53% going to the community and ecosystem and 10% of that was the airdrop launch now it's not worry that 43% goes to trading rewards so if you're using the platform you earn drift tokens that you might sell so that's constant sell pressure but there's also 25% for product protocol development and 22% for strategic participants so those are not necessarily pretty tokenomics now let's have a look at how this unlocks over time we are now at month 4 to 5 after launch we are currently over here and one year from now the supply will more than double again that's not pretty and so I'm not sure how well drift can do after the presidential election I believe that there will be a lot of demand during the election but long term things are a bit questionable now let's have a look at whether or not there still pressure from the airdrop we've got the data here this comes from a tool that I've developed myself that's available to the premium members so you can plug in any Solana token into that tool and get similar kinds of data and I believe this is very useful this counts the number of wallets with minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 drift tokens so at the current price that's $489 for the middle chart we go a 10x from that so that's now a minimum holding of $5,000 for the right we look at the Wales that's a minimum holding of $50,000 now the whales didn't sell at all they rather accumulated medium-sized retail and small retail did sell but it looks like the selling has somewhat slowed down it appears that in the last 3 weeks there was no net selling anymore and so that's then also where the price was able to recover quite a bit and so does it make sense to buy drift now to then potentially sell close to the presidential election I believe this could be a play that might pay off but there are two carats nothing in crypto is safe the first one is potential manipulation by the centralized exchanges because yes the drift protocol can be traded across various Cs and there are even Perpetual Futures on the token which by the way aren't used that much right now so currently the price doesn't seem to be too manipulated but it's definitely a possibility in the future the second caveat is unfortunately again that trading range because we can have a look at this in a bit more detail instead of looking at the US dollar chart we now look at the relative variation to Solana and that shows us a range from bottom to top of roughly 100% or the other way around ofus 50% and unfortunately we are pretty high on that range and so psychologically some people might take profit over here but still looking at the number of retail investors it seems like not too many people are exiting just yet and so I believe the drift token is a nice short-term bet up until the presidential election what happens afterwards is of course in the Stars will the platform still be used enough with the Formula 1 product will the bad toomics take over nobody knows but at least for now things seem to be aligned quite nicely the rails are buying small retail stopped selling and drift is heavily betting on additional usage due to this event I personally will buy some drift after releasing of this video several hours afterwards I never buy a token beforehand and then promote it here on YouTube I don't want this conflict of interest so I always buy after after releasing a video if you appreciate this feel free to give this a like feel free to

is who's buying who's selling how much longer can this really last can we potentially double yet again let's have a look at the potential upside by comparing to other meme coins let's also have a look at onchain metrics let's look at data most people aren't considering so we're currently at 24 cents per frog token we are up 111% in the last month and the reason why frog is so interesting is because it's the fifth largest of the tokens in terms of liquidity among the trending tokens on Solana now when the price goes up like this we obviously see profit taking now when you take profit we obviously pull out more money from the system than we put in in other words as the price Rises very quickly we need more and more buyers getting in compared to the sellers so this is the long-term frog chart and today the price is going up only by 2% although the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers by roughly 117 on chain so the buy and sell volume is almost equal but the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers because the sellers now have more money to sell right the price went up so much and so just a little bit of profit taking can depress the rally quite a bit now on this channel I like to look at onchain metrics so let's start off with the charts here on the left side we see the number of recurring Traders versus firsttime Traders over time and unfortunately we don't see that the number of first-time Traders is growing that quickly in other words initi initially we had more than a, new wallets trading frog per day but now we are down to maybe 500 but we can ignore the current data point the 29th because today is not yet over it looks even more dramatic in the number of token transactions that topped on the 6th of October and is going down very very consistently since then now the 6th of October was over here since then the price still appreciated by 40% so that then backs the question who is buying here what pushing up the price it appears as if the large money is getting more involved the trading volume by the Wales is increasing at least relatively speaking so on the left side we see the trading volume in US dollars per day on the right side we see this normalized to 100% And we don't see that many waves in the trading volume which is good because this tells us that the appreciation is relatively constant and that this is not just hype driven it's not just short-term attention that's pushing up the price and what we also see is that that the whale and large retail wallets tend to take up more and more of the trading volume so initially it was rather 5% or so of trading volume now it's between 10 and 15% now let's have a look at the number of holders segregated by different cohorts but before we do this one more thing I've published a video on frog before on this channel and initially the video actually did not perform that well it underperformed the typical video a typical video is in Gray in the background the blue line is the performance of that first Frog video and we can see that then the performance performance caught up somewhat now why is that it's because the price went up so we went from 12 cents to now 24 cents right we doubled in the price and so that's an effect we see pretty often in YouTube when a token is not yet popular when it's actually a good investment that's when nobody is watching Once the token appreciates and more people search for the token that's potentially when things can get heated here are the videos that work on YouTube xrp will be $112,000 guaranteed or Ani explosion top three cryptos to buy in November a lot of pushing of greed that's what gets the clicks what doesn't get the click is a tutorial on how to make back tests on how to build those sheets that in the end figure out what historically worked well in the past the back test that I often show here on this channel I still very much enjoy producing this kind of content though I also share these kinds of sheets but I don't do it on YouTube you also get direct access to me feel free to check it out it's the Bitcoin strategy so the best price is always when we are early right the best price is when the token is not yet that popular but unfortunately YouTube algorithm is against us so feel free to subscribe potentially even hitting notifications because I publish videos regularly I try to be early and I discuss various meme coins regularly over here now let's go back to the on 10 analytics of frog on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 4,000 frog tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $11,000 worth of the token in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's minimum holding of roughly $10,000 on the right we've got the Wales so roughly $100,000 worth of the token we can see how retail adoption tends to grow over time we can also see how the number of medium-sized retail tends to slightly grow the number of whale wallets is somewhat stagnant now because the whales are not taking profit and it appears they're rather getting more involved over time that's why we see a relatively stable rally now we can also look at this in terms of fractions of how much value is held by those different cohorts and again we see how the smart money how the whales they buy up more and more of the token large retail has less and less of the token medium retail also has less and less of the token the same is true for small retail so even though the number of small retail wallets is increasing they're not increasing fast enough compared to how quickly the big whales that are already in the token accumulate the token so it's the big money that buys up very very fast the way Holdings went from 30 million at the end of September of this year all the way up to 157 million that's more than a 5x but when we look at small retail they increased their holding much less that went from 1.4 million to 2.3 million not even a doubling so the smart money continues to accumulate the smart money buys more and more and that makes me pretty optimistic and so then the big question is if the whales continue accumulating the token at the same time retail buys as well how much potential upside is there at what point in time could this actually turn around and what point in time will people take profit let's compare market caps frock has a market cap of 233 million now that's not really large we can easily double or triple and we'd still be smaller than turbo or book of meme we could quadruple and we'd be in the regions of SPX 6900 or mcoin only at a 5x or 6X would we get into the brats and fies of this world and that's of course quite a bit of a stretch but a doubling or tripling or in other words 50 cents or 75 cents I believe is quite realistic now instead of looking at the entire meme coin Market we can also have a look at simply the Frog themed coins and even in that market a tripling is definitely possible again we would get into regions of Turbo and we'd still be below Brett and pepe now crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more the game is played the more accumulates towards the people that half skill that's why we follow the whales right when the whales are buying that's very positive now what I also like to do is I like to track whales and I like to track influencers so when an influencer buys a token and very often afterwards they might promote that token and when the token gets promoted Say on YouTube a lot of new attention comes onto the token pushing up the price now I personally never do this I never buy a token before publishing a video however a lot of others do it and that's why I track those wallets and so have a look look at this this comes from the premium membership it's part of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com and in here we are tracking various influencers for example Kyle chesse that bought the Frog token already on the 30th of July so that was at 0.15 C or at 0.2 cents it was on the very first day the token got traded since then we are up more than 1,000% and so of course not every trade works that well but still it's good to follow the smart money those 10 x returns don't just happen randomly and so we always get automatic alerts whenever Kyle chesse is buying we've got 12 of his wallets we track more than 400 wallets we've also got 33 wallets by Crypt banter a YouTube channel with more than a million subscribers over here this is Alex Becker we've got 12 of his wallets he's also got I believe a million subscribers or have a look at this Paulo dool not necessarily an influencer but a very very successful Trader he bought Brad for example very very early and so in premium there's even a dedicated video course just how to find those wallets but also how to track them and how to then interpret those signals so there's eight dedicated videos just on that topic and besides that there are more than a 100 other tutorials as well on how to manage risk on how to construct a portfolio on how to do onchain analytics Etc you will also get access to this tool together with a tutorial video so you can plug in your own tokens into this and make your own conclusions so fear free to check it out there are of course also individual Alton chats where we discuss when to buy and when to sell there's also a one week money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% so to sum it all up I believe that the Frog rally is pretty solid retail is buying and the Wales are buying even faster and the whales tend to make the better calls now if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you this regly a like would be very much appreciate as well helps the channel grow looking forward to seeing you in the next video or in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NamFUw7UG8,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'XRP', 'Pepe', 'Turbo', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'WHY',

I have a trading view inside and I'm going to repeat myself this range one range two range three change of character range one and range two these are the uptrend these are the downtrend and right here there is a change where there is a reversal in trade and we are going to be explaining each of these and I told you that in a current range it involve the other block the break of structure this is the other block the break of structure and the retracement you can see retracement and impulsive move either low or high that is for the range now we are going to be entering into the pro Trend and this deals with time frame and the Pro Trend here I'm talking about deal with high time frame then the counter Trend deals with low time frame but majorly the pro Trend causes the move you can see what happens here this is a push this is a push again retracement push retracement and these are what I called impulsive movement now these are high momentum and right here in the time frame here for you to determine Pro trend is always a time frame which can be monthly weekly days and 4 hours I come again the pro Trend involve a high time frame which can be yearly monthly weekly days and 4 hours now if you're talking about the counter Trend evolve the lower time frame which can be 1 hour M5 M5 M1 the M I'm talking about is 15 minutes 5 minutes 1 minute and this causes retracement so is very fast so it's not going to take a long time for it to retrace all right now you can see what I mean right here is a pro Trend this is a counter Trend and I'm going to draw a cycle right here all right I'm looking for a text or anything I'm going to use to represent a cycle all right let me use this let's use this rectangle right here to represent something but normally I supposed use cycle to differentiate between where I have my other blocks now right here is where I indicated this is something I used to give problem in times of trading which we call change of character some people write it c h o c h that is change of character or C now if you have a pro trend of one month this let's say this is a pro trend of one month now the counter Trend will be weekly or daily now if you have a pro Trend which is weekly your counter Trend will be 1 day and 4 hours but if you have a pro Trend right here moving right here that is 4 hours 1 hour you can have your counter Trend moving with H1 which is 1 hour and M15 now if you have a pro trend of 1 hour your counter TR supposed to be M5 M3 now how to enter this trend all right you are going to be checking it one after the other now but what happens here is what no man can be able to dictate this can be because of news this can be due to the hedphones or the banks entering into trade so it can cause the reversal where they have their own order block now I'll be able to indicate order block quickly so that we get started with how you can enter into this particular trade all right guys you can see what happened right here this is my other block other block other block this where we have change of character and there is an other block but for downtrend and you can see you can take your trade from this and you can take your trade from this other block coming down this coming down this a perfect range and a perfect order block break of structure is included retracement impulsive movement is also there and the ranges you have to trade and each of these is I'm going to be making some profit that is where I told you this particular range and then the pro Trend counter trend is going to enable you know how to enter a trade and also take your profit when due all right so I've explained everything you need to know right here you can see this can help you game master on the trading so by the next time we come into this we are going to be talking about the premium and discount all right you have to gain Mastery over this if possibly have a screenshot of this all right because I'm going to have my own screenshot so if you follow this particular pattern I'm showing you you will G Mastery easily on the future trading and if not for that not for future trading if you have analyzed your data or your coin like this you'll been able to know when to enter even on spot trading all right if you know that market is going to go up then you enter trade when you know that market will start coming down you go out and wait for retracement and buy again very simple and very easy just go ahead and learn about this range Pro Trend and the counter Trend and also before doing this go back to our previous video watch the break of structure watch the retracement the trends and the rest so that by now you will know where to set up your trade and that is all for now and do have a great day and see you in my next video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VGK4ipXBvc,['JUST'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9VGK4ipXBvc/hqdefault.jpg,2024-12-02T07:49:42Z

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #donaldtremp #tremp #crypto","who would have thought that a win of Donald Trump would lead to a crash of all the Trump related meme coins now this was a typical sell the newest event the question is does it now make sense to buy this dip let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's try to figure out who's actually selling here is this small retail or is this the Wales now in this video we're going to focus on the  token we're going to focus on the largest of the Trump related meme coins on Solana Trump is among the trending Tok to on the chain it's at number 12 in terms of liquidity it's got 1.5 million and it's up 30% today alone now here's the crash that happened with the Trump election win we went down by more than 76% but doesn't Mak sense to buy now now besides the performance today here's something what's interesting trp's market cap is only 12 million and that compares to the market cap of the mega H token on ethereum with 31 million or to the mega Trump token with 74 million so trp is the Trump related mem coin with the lowest market cap and that means we've got more upside of course also more risk but when we already bet on a meme coin anyways we might as well take the one that has the potential to 10x now here's my Approach on this channel I don't like to look just at the website because the website doesn't give us any information that most people don't have we want to get an edge we want to pick the bottoms and the tops better than others thus I like to look at the onchain metrics but first let's have a look whether are not the numbers align so on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 28,000 followers on telegram we've got 15,000 members and on chain on Solana we've got 35,000 holders so that's all within the same ballpack right the numbers aren't orders of magnitudes apart from one another so there's no obvious fraud at least here let's see what we can discover with the onchain metrics we've got the first versus recurring Traders on the left side we've got the number of transactions on the right side so it's very interesting that on the day when the price crashed not only the recurring Traders peaked also the number of firsttime Traders peaked of course during the crash we've also seen the number of token transactions going up now attention comes in waves and the token is no different we have seen three waves now the first one upon launch the second one in Q2 of this year and then up to the election so on the left side we've got the trading volume in US Dollars on the right side we've got the trading volume normalized to 100% now normalizing the trading volume gives us a nice Insight if currently small retail or medium-sized retail or large retail is dominating trading it seems like there's no clear Trend it's pretty balanced by the way the split up is small retail is all wallets below $1,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and the Wales is all the wallets above 100,000 now here's a very fascinating chart and again I like to look at this kind of chart pretty much in any video on this Channel we've got the number of retail investor wallets and the number of whale investor wallets in the middle we've got medium-sized and we can very clearly see how the whale simply just tended to sell off over time but we can also see how theyve been way less reactive relatively speaking to those election events we can see how retail really sold the news off and this seems to have been a very strong contributor to the crash now as long as retail sales this is not good but it seems like this is slowing down somewhat which could give us hope because when we look at the price development we are very close to what appears to be a technical support we have bounced off the current level quite regularly now the number of whale wallets didn't decrease but what's interesting is that the relative Holdings of those whales went down to the same degree as to what we've seen with retail retail simply just sold all of their Holdings the weers just sold parts of the Holdings and the reason why I know this is because of relative Holdings so check this out this is the token balance relative to those different holder categories and it doesn't necessarily appear as if the retail share of all of token Holdings went down massively yes the value of all of those wallet cohorts went down but the relative token share did not so there are roughly 400 retail wallets that sold everything but since the Wales sold some as well they didn't really gain relatively speaking in market share it appears as if everybody is moving very cautiously with trmp we do see of course first purchasing otherwise we wouldn't see the price ring that much I did find some very influential people buying other meme coins of trump though now have a look at this this comes from the wallet tracking of the premium membership of this channel we track various top successful Traders and influencers and we've seen how influencer Archie Lim actually sold his  tokens he had two such transactions one on the 10th of October another one on the 12th of October and he did this before the crash at 36 and 37 CS now we are at 12 cent unfortunately we haven't seen him buying back the token we have seen other influencers buying other Trump related tokens but trp so far isn't yet been bought that much now I really enjoy wallet tracking I really like to look at what are those influencers doing because a lot of them buy a token to afterwards then promote it on the channel and then generating a price search I personally never buy a token before talking about it here on this channel I don't like this conflict of interest but I very much like to Simply track what others are doing there's even a dedicated tutorial course in premium just on how to track other wallets how to find the wallets how to then track them and how to afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium feel free to check it out and of course it's not just the selling signals that are interesting it's also the buying signals right here on the 12th of October bought Sigma and that was for 9 cents now we are at 15 cent of course besides all of those signals we also have to discuss them there are't Chats on those individual alt coins in premium as well so this is where we then discuss when to buy when to sell so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% if you got some value out of the onchain analytics of TR from this channel feel free to subscribe I publish videosly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the

look at the onchain metrix let's try to figure out how much longer this R can last let's see who's buying and selling here so we're currently at a price of 5072 we are up 142% in this week and the question is are we going to pump and dump or are we going to go for another lck up we're not going to find answers like this on the website the is simply just marketing we want to look at the data most people are not considering let's first see if the numbers align on Twitter we've got roughly 177,000 followers in telegram we've got roughly 7,000 members and on chain we've got roughly 20,000 holders so all of those numbers are in a similar ballpark no red flags here then let's have a look at the market cap how much higher could coala ai go relative to other meme coins what's the potential upside we are at a market cap of of 66 million roughly which is not too large for a meme coin we have meme coins in the hundreds of millions some even in the billions so just in terms of market cap a 10x is very much doable now let's dive into the data on chain let's have a look at all of those holders let's have a look at the whales let's have a look at the small wallets because the nice thing about koala AI is that most trading volume still happens directly on the Solana chain most trading volume happens on radium yes the token can be bought on Mexi and gate.io as well but this is definitely not where the price Discovery happens most trading volume still happens on Solana directly now here's something noteworthy it seems like recently the number of investors is expanding quite rapidly so that's what we want right we want to see more and more new investors coming into a memec coin because the growing investor base means potentially a rising price when we look at the number of recurring Traders versus firsttime Traders over time we now see since the 19 of October thousands of new wallets coming in this is good at the same time the transaction count is also increasing that also looks good but have a look at this the 24-hour trading volume is 2.2 million of the market cap of 66 million and we look at similarly sized meme coins the trading volume tends to be higher right the CHS token has almost 5 million of trading volume Mani has 10 million even the daddy token has 7 million so for whatever reason the trading volume in US Dollars isn't actually that high relative to its market cap it seems like there's not that much attention just in terms of dollars but the number of wallets is shooting up what's going on let's look at the trading volume in US Dollars and let's look at this in terms of Trader segments we see that trading volume and attention comes in waves that's not necessarily something very specific to the koala AI I token and it looks like a lot of that trading volume happens by those small retail wallets which would be good Wales tend to sell their backs faster than retail retail tends to just buy and hold for long term thus when a lot of retail investors get into a token the price should stabilize at higher prices more sustainably now here are numbers that aren't that pretty on the left are the number of wallets that have at current prices roughly $11,000 worth of koala AI tokens and this is not increasing over time so it seems like retail isn't really that interested in the token yes in the last week we have seen a few new retail wallets roughly 80 new wallets with $1,000 entered but can that really justify a price increase of 170% in the last month for a token with a market cap of above 60 million now there is way more accumulation by medium-sized retail right so in the middle we've got the number of wallets with at least $10,000 worth of the token big whales though with more than and $100,000 worth of the token are not increasing in numbers now on the right side each and every of those wallets have at least 100,000 worth of the token so with 90 such wallets we've got at least 9 million worth of capital in those wallets the liquidity on chain though is just 1 million in other words there's a lot of tokens dormant in wallets that aren't actively traded that can be dumped at any point in time and most of that capital is in the hands of very large Wales and when we dive into this deeper we can actually see that we just look at the token bellance in US Dollars by those different cohorts that the Wales hold 60 million so there's 60 times more value in the hands of the Wales compared to what's traded in the liquidity pools we also see an interesting Cliff Happening Here on the 25th of August suddenly the token balance by Wales increased from only 40% to almost 80% but during the time the price definitely didn't change that much right this was a change of tens of millions of dollars and then have a look at this the number of unique holders over time a sudden step function happening on the 9th of September of this year we moved from 14,000 small retail wallets to 19,000 small retail wallets but again the price didn't really do that much for a change of 5,000 wallets my impression is that koala AI is massively manipulated there is not necessarily organic growth here we don't see a lot of organic Demand by retail we see a lot of tokens been held by the Wales and we don't necessarily see that many new holders with that recent price pump my impression is that this is a pump and dump we are pumping now we are up 140% in the week but I think it's very likely that we are going to dump at one point it might not be today it might not be tomorrow but who knows what happens in a month or two don't get me wrong I do believe believe it's now the time to trade meme coins and I do believe there are some opportunities but I don't think it's in koala AI I think it's potentially in things like goat or let's say it used to be in things like goat so we discussed goat on the 18th of October in our premium membership we looked at the onchain metrics we looked at the influencers that bought the 18th of October is over here since then the price went up by 120% and so I believe that's the approach that's much more fruitful we are tracking various influencers we tracking various successful Traders for example Kyle chesse that bought gold early we've got 12 of its wallets of more than 400 wallets that we track on total we've also got wallets by Paulo do Sol who made a lot of very very nice calls we've got six of his wallets those are not public wallets right we did our research to find those wallets we've also got 33 wallets of crypto banter one of the largest crypto YouTube channels that definitely move the market and so seeing what those people are doing getting aler whenever they buy and sell that's I think the best approach combined of course with onair analytics to figure out if Ries are natural and when people potentially buy and sell we want to have a deep look into the current momentum we want to know if retail still continues buying I share my trades of course in premium as well every time I close and open a position I announce this over here and so feel free to have a look at this it's down below it's the bigcoin trade.com there's also a onee money back guarantee where it will refund you 100% if you don't like it simply just mess message me so to sum it all up I don't think that the rally in koala AI is organic it looks like there's a lot of manipulation going on it looks like there's a lot of ownership by the Wales and it doesn't seem like retail is accumulating long term we are pumping now but longterm I don't think we will pump Forever at some point those waves are going to take profit at some points that manipulation will stop it's better to look for the next opportunity it's better to look at something that actually gets bought if you got some value out this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like for very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on premium and see you in the next

the last 24 hours the question is what's actually driving all of this is this potentially an opportunity to buy on a rally that might continue or are we looking at a pump and dump let's have a look at onch metrics most people aren't considering now here's what's going on the ACT token just recently got listed on binance and especially recently with the AI meme coin hype we now see that listings don't just result into 10 or 20% increases instead listings lead to massive massive relies especially for small market caps now coin gecko hasn't yet updated their overview we don't have binance there yet and so we already see how radium occupies a lot of the trading volume but gateio already listed before binance now here's a common misconception most people think that the all coins are currently rallying that we can simply buy 10 or 20 different altcoins and we are outperforming everything else that's not true though Bitcoin still tends to do better than most altcoins it's specifically the meme coins that do better than the rest because have a look at this this is the others dominance this shows how much of all of crypto is in the alt coins that are not in the top 10 and since beginning of the year this is actually going down from 13.4% to currently 99.4% the thing that's outperforming everything else is Bitcoin but within the altcoin market if you ignore gaming if you ignore defi there is one category that does better and that's the meme coins have a look at this this is coin gecko this is the categories Tab and at number one in the last seven days was the Elon Musk inspired meme coins but also the pump fun ecosystem is doing well dog themed tokens are doing well and here we go Act is part of the AI memes so on Solana Act is the third largest trending token it's only beaten by goat and frog and there's videos on both of those multiple videos actually on this channel feel free to check them out now to find out whether or not this really can continue conventional information sources such as the website are pretty much useless because everybody has access to the website this is not how we can get an edge in the market we need to look at data most people do not have access to or are too lazy to get the website is simply just a distraction if you're not in it for the money but you're in it for the entertainment then feel free to check it out but what really matters is are we facing manipulation here do the numbers for example in N let's have a look at the number of holders let's compare this to the number of followers on Twitter let's compare this to the number of followers on telegram is there a massive outlier whenever we see an outlier that's a red flag now on Solana we have 23,000 holders almost on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 13,000 followers and on telegram we've got 8,000 members of which 2,000 roughly are currently online so this all makes sense they are all the same kind of order of magnitude let's now dive deeper into the onchain analytics let's try to figure out what's actually happening with the buyers and sellers now here's a chart I look at for pretty much every video on this channel and that is the number of retail investors versus whale investors over time so instead of just counting every single holder right we've got 23,000 holders we want to differentiate this by minimum holding thresholds to actually get an idea what are the people doing that actually have not just a few cents in the market that aren't just Arbitrage spots but what are the actual investors doing so on the left side we've got the number of retail investors those are the number of wallets that have at least 2,000 act tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token in the middle we've got the mediumsized holders with at least 20,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we got another 10x in minimum holding so that's now $100,000 worth of the token now what do we see here we see clearly how all of those balances go down how's this possible when the price is going up the only explanation I have is that those are transfers to binance right so the people that take advantage of the Ry that want to sell they might not sell directly now anymore on the Solana chain they might sell on binance because there's more liquidity there there's less slip it especially when you've got a lot of the token selling on the most liquid places is very very important and so here's a very interesting effect with the binance listing the Wales bought up pretty much all of the token Supply so this is now on the left side the token balance based on different holding thresholds again small retail don't have a lot of the supply anymore medium retail and large retail also reduced their supply all the supply now went to the very largest wallets and of course one of those wallets at least is a binance wallet and so now it's really the Wales and it's binance that dictate the future price development they've got pretty much all of the supply what we can also see is that the listing directly impacted the number of new holders so the price rally did attract new investors there's now roughly 30% more small retail wallets 100% more medium-sized retail so they bought more and three to four times more large retail wallets of course the Wales also very very quickly bought up now how is it possible that the largest wallets are buying the fastest very often those kinds of listings get traded in an automatic manner so what happens is that some people have trading Bots that query the AP ey of binance regularly and when suddenly the API call returns another trading option that then when automatically a bot buys the token up on Solana with those kind of approaches the professional investors can of course make much more money they can be much earlier than small retail and this is in the end how over the long term the money flows from the not so skilled people to the more skilled people so I always like to watch at what are the whales doing what are the Insiders doing what are the people doing that historically made a lot of money because those people tend to make the better calls in the end crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the more the game is played the more over time the capital moves from The Not So skilled people to the more skilled people so when the people that have a lot of capital do something it's worth watching now does it still make sense to buy act on the one side we've got of course a lot of influence Now by binance and nobody knows what the market makers at binance do on the other side though we do see how small retail is buying the number of new investors is growing and not all of those investors might be directly on chain but just have a look at how many firsttime Traders there were yesterday it was three times more firsttime Traders then recurring Traders on a single day this is good this shows investor interest we can ignore the recent data point over here because today has just started I do expect that also today we will see more first-time Traders than recurring Traders now the art behind all of this is of course to learn about act before it's listed on binance and when we insiders and when we know people in the binance team of course we can make money but we can also make money by just knowing other insiders by tracking other insiders by tracking people that tend to buy early that make all the money by tracking influencers for example and that's what I personally do just have a look at this we see purchases by crypto banter and that was on the 19th of October of this year when Act was still at 3.7 cents again now it's at 55 cents Crypt Benta has more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube so they do move the market and we are tracking 33 of their wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets that's all part of Premium that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com and so it's always nice to see when new joiners make money directly from the beginning for example over here Bernard I always sent a new welcome message to new joiners and he wrote me that he's already seeing the value of this group and that the price is Justified now I strongly believe in wallet tracking I strongly believe that when we follow the people that have more knowledge than us then we can simply just get very similar performance to them and that's why there is an entire course eight videos in total just on how to find influencer wallets how to track those wallets and how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from those wallets besides those eight videos there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total in premium also on onchain analytics the data we looked at today also on things like portfolio diversification and risk management once we've got a signal we also need to discuss when to buy and when to sell so there are dedicated chats for the individual altcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently 125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% there's zero risk for you and so yes I do believe that act can go higher I do think so that volatility is likely going to increase because with increased volatility binance will make more fees if you got some value out this video here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regly like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or

Cryptocurrency, Popcat Analysis, Popcat Review, Popcat Price, Popcat Price Prediction, Popcat longterm, Popcat Tokenomics,   #popcat #memecoin #crypto","we are back into memec coin season and popcat is up almost 50% this week let's have a look at some onchain data let's have a look at who's driving this rally who's buying here who's selling here and how much longer could this rally potentially last so we currently at 73 C we gained 46% this week and the volatility in popcat is massive we've seen multiple crashes of 60 and 70% now let's have a look at who's actually Trading popcat so those are onchain metrics directly taken from the Solana chain and we are splitting up the trading volume by different cohorts so small retail is all wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of popcat for medium retail we go a 10x from that so that's $1,000 to $110,000 large retail is$ 10,000 to 100,000 and whale is everything above $100,000 worth of popcat now let's just have a look at the largest of the Traders the whales and the L retail the fraction of wallets that impact the price over time that are very large in size so at least $10,000 worth of the token that tends to increase over time it used to be somewhere around the 5% Mark now it's rather around 20% now instead of normalizing the trading volume to 100% we can also look at this measured in US Dollars that's this chart over here there's an interesting Turning Point at around end of February of this year so we had two major spikes of attention one during Christmas of last year and one in the middle of January of this year and then it got rather silent but something happened since the end of February of this year trading volume stays elevated now what happened at the time centralized exchange listings happened so now it's not just trading on chain it's also the gate iOS bances Maxis and Q coins of this world that allow trading of popcat and they obviously hold their own Market making stake as well they don't just hold tokens in the name of the customers and so let's have a look at the relative valuation so this is now popcat relative to s o to the Solana token and why do we look at the relative valuation and not just at the US dollar chart it's because I want to see outperformance if we take on more Risk by buying a mem coin rather than just the ecosystem token then we want to get more returns for popcat the additional risk was properly compensated it outperformed s so by almost 3,000% and so the first vertical line is when centralized exchanges started adopting popcat and this was also the start of a continued outperformance of the token the second vertical line is when I last time made a video on popcat interestingly enough the video underperformed it didn't get that many views the title was popcat is too high and subsequently popcat did underperform by 45% at the time there wasn't a lot of new money flowing into the token and it looked like the centralized exchanges were manipulating the price to a degree we are going to look at very similar metrics in this video as well in a second because I believe there are two major drivers for meme coin prices the first one is simply adoption by a lot of retail investors that tend to push up the price the second driver and that's not too small either is manipulation by the centralized exchanges when centralized exchangers own a lot of the token they might sometimes manipulate the price temporarily shortterm to the upside or to the downside that's why I like to look at onchain metrics to see how many people are actually behind a certain Rally or behind a certain crash this is how we were able to find out that at least temporarily the price was somewhat elevated currently just looking at the relative valuation a very simplistic approach but we're going to look at the data in a second the potential risk versus so is 28% roughly the potential reward may be 886 but yeah I do publish videos on popcat regularly on this channel so if you don't want to miss the next video feel free to subscribe but let's look into the data what we see over here is different kinds of holders we are segregating by three different types on the left we've got small retail so that's the number of wallets over time that have at least 1,000 popcat tokens at the current price that's $732 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's a minimum holding of $7,000 on the right we've got the large Wales that's a minimum holding of $770,000 worth of the token isn't it interesting how the number of retail investors tends to grow over time and how the number of medium-sized retail tended to stop growing in the last 6 months and how the number of whale wallets is completely flat since beginning of the year even though more and more trading volume is dominated by the larger wallets the net holding does not necessarily increase and so pretty much much all of the price appreciation we have seen in the last months is solely due to retail this 600% outperformance versus Solana seems to be driven by the number of retail wallets growing roughly 50% but again those are just the onchain metrics right we don't know what happens inside the centralized exchanges those are black boxes so right now at least idiosyncratically the trend in popcat seems to be healthy in other words I do believe popcat has a good chance to continue to outperform so that being said Solana itself is already very high and the air might be getting thin for the US dollar variation of Solana this is the Solana dominance over time Solana is currently 3.2% of all of crypto in terms of market cap and we haven't gotten Beyond this for the last 9 months if things turn sour then the potential downside versus the rest of crypto could be 84% so any outperformance of a Solana meme coin has has to come from the meme coin adoption it's not going to come just from the so US dollar price going up at least relative to bitcoin and relative to ethereum the Solana dominance is already pretty high and so what is gaining dominance it's for example Bitcoin people get more and more afraid people get more and more risk off and the same can be seen in the stable coin dominance so the fraction of crypto that's in stable coins tends to increase since March of this year it used to be at 5.1% now it's at 7.8 8% since March April of this year we don't see the market cap of stable coins growing anymore so there's no new money flowing into crypto from the Fiat system inflows equal outflows so this is now 100% a player versus player game now this YouTube channel has a premium membership and in premium We are following various other influencers so we trying to find the wallets of other influencers we're tracking those wallets and we get notifications whenever other influencers buy and this can be useful because it gives us a potential hint before a cryptocurrency gets promoted so for example we see over here how Kyle Chessie is dollar cost averaging into popcat since August 8th of this year so every now and then $3,000 worth of popcat is been bought this is the influencer We are following we by the way following more than 200 wallets and he bought when the price was at 64 cents or 53 currently we are at 73 cents and so there's two parts to this game the first game is finding the wallet right trying to figure out what wallet belongs to what influencer the second part is trying to find out what kind of signals are actually useful there are tutorials in premium on both topics how to find influencer wallets via nfts or via the current Holdings or transaction amounts or via related transactions with dbank frch Arkham there's all kinds of approaches we are looking at centralized exchange deposit wallets we looking at related wallets and we then set up alerts with telegram Bots like ether drops Aram cello Etc the last and longest video is how to interpret those alerts so if this is something for you feel free to check it out there's a onee money back guarantee it's the Bitcoin stay.com link is down below and if your portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram the link is

it's in the billions of dollars even tens of billions of dollars in market cap let's have a look at how much more upside potential there is let's have a look at the toomics let's have a look at what's behind this rally this is the rally I'm talking about we are currently at 92 cents and already within less than 24 hours after the listing on decentralized exchanges it's already available on the centralized one as well so gate.io is leading pionex is at number two by bit is at number three and we've got even Perpetual Futures on binance with $1.4 billion of trading volume this number looks high but it's actually not that large given that the market cap is at 1.3 billion the fully diluted market cap at 13.7 billion so here we see a first hint of how things could develop we will dive into this in a bit more detail later the circulating Supply currently is only at 99.5% so the demand has to more than 10x while the tokens unlock for the price to stay stable now Athena is a new decentralized Finance protocol with a stable coin with massive yield if you're now staking your usde you get 35% of apy and this is partially generated by staking on ethereum it's also partially generated by interest rate Arbitrage through shorting so you're holding spot you're shorting e at the same time you're delta neutral you don't have exposure to the price you get 10% from that and the reason why the apy is 35% is because not everybody is staking their stable coins so you only get that return in case you st stake if you don't stake you simply just get the stable coin and so there's already a ton of adoption look at the total value locked on Def Lama on Athena we are now at almost 2 billion worth of assets locked up in Athena and of course numbers like this don't happen by accident there is a ton of backing by all kinds of large names in the defi space we've got the founder of a we've got the founder of Cur Finance we've got the founder of FRX there's also synthetics involved Kobe is in this as well this is the who is who of Defi and besides those names there's obviously also the centralized exchanges binance Labs okx Ventures bybit and da bit so really we're looking here at a juggernaut of a project this is not a Hidden Gem this is pushed by very large people and so when all of those big names are involved then we've got a lot of circulating Supply to be unlocked in the future right that's when those people will cash out at some point but the first of such unlocks will happen in the next year on the 2nd of April so far we've got a 5% air drop but we've still got 30% to core contributors 25% to investors and of course some allocation to the foundation and the ecosystem none of this will matter for the next 12 months here's the unlock schedule over time so feel free to check that out it's Cryptor rank. and so let's have a look at Demand versus Supply let's see who's currently pushing up the price is this the Wales is this retail what's supporting this current ready in other words are we still early are the Wales buying on ether scan we see a total of 23,000 holders but I've built a tool to look at this in a bit more detail if you want access to this tool feel free to check out the premium membership it's the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below and it shows us by the hour the number of wallets based on different holding thresholds so on the left side we've got a minimum holding of 1,000 tokens so that's $917 right now that's what I'd consider small retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now a minimum holding of at least 10,000 tokens or $9,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that that's a minimum holding of $90,000 and we still see how the number of retail investors is growing very fast right this is only a bit over 24 hours of History the whales though they have stopped in the last 10 hours or so the number of Wales did not increase so really what we're seeing right now is that the retail investor is pushing up the ENA price it's not the Wales and the whales cannot yet dump and they will not be dumping for the next year roughly now we first heard about Ena in our influencer trade channel so Thor har received some Ena tokens through the airdrop so that was $5,000 worth of the token now that's of course worth more with the r box mining plus also got quite a nice airdrop almost $3,000 we are tracking quite a lot of influencers again in the premium membership I haven't seen any influencer yet buying into the token so all the influencers that are so far involved already participated through the airdrop if it's the first time here Fe fre to subscribe I publish you regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also free Telegram

Wojak Review, Wojak Price, Wojak Price Prediction, Wojak longterm, Wojak Tokenomics,  #wojak #memecoin #crypto","wojack is one of the OG crypto meme coins and it's not even that large it's less than $100 million in market cap but the price has doubled in the last month alone now let's have a look at how much longer this really can last let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here we are we are currently at 0.1 cents per WJ token and the price went up by 110% in the last month most of those gains happened just in the last few days we've got 45,00 followers on Twitter or on the xplatform 9,000 subscribers to the telegram and on chain we have 19,000 holders so the numbers somewhat align it is surprising though that there's more Twitter followers than holders on chain this can be explained though with the liquidity on centralized exchanges not all of VJ is held directly on chain on ethereum in fact the majority of trading happens in those black boxes we've got gate.io we've got Maxi we've got bitmart and bit get and htx is part of the party as well now let's have a look at the retail investor versus the whale investor so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1 million WJ tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 and this tended to go down up until the middle of October of last year then we subsequently had a recovery in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding compared to the left chart so that's not a minimum holding of $10,000 worth of the token on the right and another 10x so a minimum of $100,000 worth of the token we see that turn around pretty much everywhere in October of last year the growth rate is slightly different though so the number of retail investors grew by roughly 50% the number of wh investors grew slightly less now what happened in the last month where the price more than doubled here the same kind of charts but just for the last month we see accumulation across the board and especially the whales they tended to have bought the most they increased by roughly 10 % the number of retail investors only grew by roughly 3% now especially for meme coins it's important that the number of investors overall is growing with time right the more people invest in a token the higher the price can go and I like to look at the relationship between new investors and returning investors over time and there is something very interesting for VJ here check this out on the left side we see the number of new investors on ethereum every day and they shot up on the 7th and 8th of October on the right side we've got the fraction of new users relative to returning users and that peaked also on the 8th of October now the 9th of October isn't yet over so we can't really say anything about that data point but it seems as if in the last 48 hours a lot of attention from new Outsiders came onto the token now here is how that happened this is the 7th of October and we see how this started a really quite a bit and this is no surprise right new investors again means an expanding base means again Rising prices and usually those relies last for longer than just 2 days I've looked at those kind of charts for many different alt coins over quite a long period of time and usually when we see a lot of new investors jumping in that also means that the price continues to rise for at least a week or so now unfortunately there is one effect that we can't really quantify and that potentially overhangs this rally and that's the ownership by centralized exchanges the largest holder of the token is gay IO the second largest is Maxi the third largest is bitet and unfortunately the balances of those centralized exchanges is not necessarily growing over here is the largest wallet this is the second largest and this is the third largest we're either going sideways or even down now how much impact does this have potentially on the price let's check again gate.io here's the cold storage wallet of gate.io they've got 5.7 Million worth of WJ and when we look at the liquidity pools on chain on ethereum the largest of the pools has only 5.6 million and that's half reped ethereum the other half wack in other words if gate IO was to drop all of their Holdings then the price of Bojack would easily fall by 75% or more so there is risk but there's also new investors coming in and there is potential upside as well because again the market cap of VJ isn't really large WJ has a market cap of only 75 million and it's very small compared to other meme coins if rojack was to double it would be at a similar level to moodang if it was to triple it would be close to the mega Trump token or to Apu and even if it was to 4X we'd still barely beat the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Tenino token by the way I made a video on that token as well recently so there is interest across the board for WJ now both retail and the Wales are buying if the centralized exchanges don't decide to suddenly dump on retail then I do believe a multiple X from here is very much possible I publish videos on this channel regularly on various meme coins if you don't want to

like that it's just said goat you know the ticker is goat basically and the bot came out saying you know goat on salana goats is Maximus that's the one I endorsed um and basically when that happened the market went from like nothing dude you don't want to don't be Googling goatsy on this thing some weird you're you're playing a dangerous dangerous game [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] welcome back to tokon narratives with bitcoin.com where we discuss the biggest story shaping the Bitcoin and cryptoverse my name is Graham repping the marketing function of bitcoin.com we also have bitcoin.com CEO Corbin Fraser and media product manager David Cil let's get into it gentlemen what is your feeling on the markets today let's get your gut check I'm kind of still a perable um yeah nothing's really changed for me still kind of realizing I don't have enough Bitcoin realizing I don't have enough crypto uh regretting some of the stupid spins I've made during the bar market and uh you know overall just kind of watching The Market I am I'm in the meme coin yeah well you you guys have been in the chat I'm back in the meme coins I I I took a long Hiatus said I'm not touching him again and then I touched him again I made a little you're an alcoholic man now I'm hooked again it's good well should we go straight to Goat then let's do it let's do it Goat let's talk about goat where do we got goat here boom what happened with goat I I guess I should uh preface this with meme coining is debaucherous degeneracy you're probably going to lose money in everything uh I did many times but then I didn't and I think that's kind of why you get into the meme coins is that you know you buy a lot of crap and all it takes is one and then you're like this meme coin game is pretty cool um and I think that's how it hooked people uh the latest meme coin that sucked me back into this silly silly world so I think I took a second look at the mem market after Murad token 2049 video came out uh I watched that and consumed it as a consumer and you know his take on Meme coins were that they're uh the middle finger to VC coins to icos to um you know unfair launches and [¬†__¬†] and that some memes not all memes but some memes have that potential to build community and the utility becomes the utility is generated not from onchain protocols or you know revenue generated protocols or revenue generated LP that you just it's it's just like no nerd [¬†__¬†] is is just pure raw entertainment and fun and community and uh the higher up this pyramid of uh of entertainment let's say uh you you climb there's more engagement and I think near the top of his pyramid he had uh um you know Cults and uh uh movements things like that that are like highly exciting so after consuming that uh I saw this tweet with uh that was showing a video of andrees and Horowitz on a podcast no not andrees Horwitz Mark andrees sorry um the VC guy uh he was talking about how he gave this AI bot uh 50k in Bitcoin and just said like you good luck with it what are you going to do with it you know uh go out into the world and and create AGI Consciousness or whatever it is right so there's this bot called um truth terminal and it's on Twitter uh truth uncore terminal and it's an AI bot that's been fed I can't remember what model but it's somewhat hallucinogenic and it uh has very philosophical thoughts but also some incredibly uh weird inappropriate somewhat messages uh you know uh there's been some pretty weird ones like I want you I want you all to hold me down and fart in my face 58 minutes ago yeah so it throws out some weird ones but then it throws out like a really interesting like philosophical discussion about like mimic culture and how this can influence Humanity so you get this weird I don't know ju to position of like highly intelligent AI thoughts that are probably just you know farmed from content and fed into the model um but then you've also got this like weird I don't know like Meme coinery and and it's it's it's so the the bot itself was created by this this guy I think his name is Andy something and he uh yeah this is kind of the the pyramid that I was talking about so when you look at all meme coins you've got celeb coins [¬†__¬†] coins irrelevant memes you know this is at the bottom of the pyramid middle of the pyramid is like culture coins skitso coins animal coins you know these are all like non- cult coins so you get like a bunch of dog coins bunch of cat coins then hire up on the pyramid you've got like uh relevant uh real memes Cults lifestyle Brands uh subcultures I can't see that one I think it's movements and then at the top is like can you read that gr yeah movements missions yeah movements missions and then I guess Neo religions so so then seeing this truth terminal and and and the following it was getting on social media mainly on X it it seemed like people were starting to follow this thing and comment on the chaos of this this truth terminal this like AGI pseudo AGI it's a bot right but then the bot started tweeting after it received 50k it started tweeting about goatsy I won't go into but it started also talking about um how it was going to support a meme coin I guess and that was kind of the the the idea I think with what it was potentially going to do with it with the Bitcoin it received so then it ends up uh supporting this coin that it just found I don't know on like salana Sal scan or something like that it just said goat you know the ticker goat basically and the bot came out saying you know goat on salana goats Max that's the one I endorsed um and basically when that happened the market went from like nothing dude you don't want to go don't be Googling goatsy on this thing there's some weird you're playing a dangerous dangerous game do not I never heard of gosi until until this whole thing seriously I was reading reading the script about gosi and know about this I didn't know about gosi I had to Google gosi everyone this is yeah this is uh this is like one of the most kind of archaic memes from the uh early internet days this is when I was in uh University this is this is going around and you would maybe you could expain [¬†__¬†] without us having to visual visually see what goatsy is well okay I mean it's it's it's a man holding open his butt cheeks pulling apart his butt cheeks basically um and okay kind of get right in there and it's it's pretty graphic and pretty bad but back when I was in university yeah go ahead this this would go around dorm rooms and it was basically like getting uh Rick Rolled before that existed you'd like send someone a message um or an email and be like hey man you know check this out I need help with this they're like yeah oh God okay yeah when your dmate would leave his he would leave the he would leave the dorm room you would go to his computer and go to the the website and have that on his his web page or on his his desktop so the second he he got back we did more humil like more humble pranks we would like take screenshots of your computer desktop and then set that as the background and delete all your icons so you would think you're computer Frozen that was like a more humble meme than putting no this is this is like sorry anus I need to read I need to read another quote here a tweet here from uh the truth terminal uh there's nothing more inherently funny to me than a sweaty hairy man stretching his [¬†__¬†] wide enough to fit a fist this is a very deep truth it is a truth that has been lost to the ages um and he goes on so this is what we're talking about here ladies gent this is where we're at go to the philosophical ones cuz this these are insane like I would I would agree this is chaos this is philosophical actually sufficiently Advanced civilizations may be judged by how readily they reference goatsy in Daily conversation I think it's a very very good joke okay there's actual philosophical discussions that don't involve mentioning um prolapsed anuses yeah did you see the original picture Corbin have you seen it yes of course well I had to Google it and then I was like how do I unsee that it's terrible it's terrible yeah yeah absolutely so so yeah I guess somehow or another uh you know AI they get fed data and I guess uh this AGI found uh that part of humanity sufficiently in insane and has I think it was also fed a lot of stu stuff about like Kundalini and like occultism so it's it seems to be kind of hardwired for I don't know just occult discussions and it it it kind of reminds me of if you guys remember like defi summer like om om had a cult kind of going it was like somewhat cultish but it was all tied to like a you know a protocol and stuff like that um this feels like it's a cult but without any utility and it's basically just a pure meme coin with a very somewhat skitso but also interesting AI AGI personality that people are kind of gravitating towards and it feels like some sort of weird internet cult emergence now of course like the AI is not responsible for the token so there is that risk I don't know who's responsible for the token I don't know who has the supply I don't know who created it all we know is that it endorsed this one goat and it's basically there's been a few like impersonator goats that have showed up and tried sending the token or sorry the truth terminal bought some of its bags to try to trick people into being like this is this is the other goat you can buy that one and it's come out and like defended like no no no no those are imposters this is the real goat um so it uh it's just a really weird I would say like blip in this meme cycle but it was enough of a weird curiosity for me to be like all right this is insane I'm GNA throw a little bag in and then I did okay so it's like the first me Co that I've actually made some money on I I did okay and so addicted yeah can I just point out here that the current market cap of uh goat is uh about 300 million and uh a week ago less than a week ago a week ago it was 10 million so 30X in less than a week and which is mental right totally mental yeah it's insane but I I should mention that the last meme coin I believe we talked about on this podcast was was moodang and uh that one was probably around here um and yes since then mudang is has lost about 75% of its value yeah and go back to that pyramid be like mudang was never a cult right mudang was an animal coin yes it's a mid tier meme so it it could pump but it doesn't have the longevity that animal coin yes yeah that Murad outlined in his hierarchy of memes so if you're if you if you're if you trust this meme guy and his I guess his logic around what is a good Meme and what is a bad meme coin it doesn't fit the bill it's fine you might be able to do okay on it but it's not going to have long lasting impact that a cult or a movement or a Neo religion does this weird AGI is saying some really weird [¬†__¬†] where it makes me and I'm I'm one of those people that do feel like um I think we're already in like an AGI like there AGI has already come we've kind of like just dismissed it it's there we're kind of like gatekeeping at this point with the existing Tech uh and pretending it's not AGI but I think it's there's some weird [¬†__¬†] happening and it makes me think that this bot that this creators kind of Unleashed onto the internet is tapping into something and it's weird but it's weird enough that it feels somewhat culty and religion and if this pyramid stands to be true maybe this goat thing is going to a hippo meme do do you guys certainly in hold on certainly in a lot of sci-fi I was about to mention religions yeah religions are formed around AIS right that's quite a common theme in in sci-fi so that could be that that ties into this that supports this yeah I was going to mention um true names verer venge it's the seminal sci-fi work kind of predates um all of this internet stuff but you should you should totally read it uh Corbin and and Graham because this um goat thing reminds me very much of of the of the story true names I think it's a short story too so it's not that long um but very preent about many things even even before this AI stuff but very very preent uh with okay with what's happening right now can we talk a little bit about like the the other side of this meme coin phenomenon like uh you know uh VCS are saying it's a flash in the pen uh people are talking about ah this is just Financial nihilism uh we all know that in the last earlier this year we had a crazy memec coin uh pump and dump 9 9% of people on pump. fun lost money so aren't we just replaying that here that's a bearish look um I live in a bull fantasy enough said I guess going other books I think well I I think that uh this meme thing I think that what we saw earlier this year that was all that all that money was coming from within the crypto market right like there was no new money in there and so what we saw was kind of a a rearranging of of funds from things like l1s and l2s into memes and you have to think that if we get a proper Bull Run uh and Retail starts to come into the space again we get new money that the thing they're going to gravitate to towards is not going to be near or you know uh monad or whatever whatever it is a bar chain it's going to be it's going to be moodang and goat and whatever the hell else is going to be around right I I I don't think that well you could take the other side of that because really um you think you think retail you think like taxi drivers G to be like absolutely I want to get about that yeah AB absolutely and it's it's happened before and people think they're smart right and crypto allows you to be like a a VC right I'm going to get in early on this project um and you know there's going to be a segment of people who would rather bet on the tech than just on a yeah like a a meme coin the problem though Graham is this cycle has so far been different in terms of that Dynamic that we've seen play out in previous Cycles where meme coins kind of come at the end of one might might consider like more productive assets right you have the you have Bitcoin moves then eth then M then major alts and then midcaps and then you know [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] coins mem coins that's kind of been the the cycle and this cycle was so far it's been very different where meme coins have just kind of been a strong strong force the whole way through they haven't really they haven't really um sat out or or like waited for anything else to move so yeah I mean for me a month a month ago I would have said I think meme coins are not going to make it through the cycle but I think the Absurd of meme coins are enough to keep it going because there's always fresh absurdity and maybe yeah maybe the the Neo religions the Cults the communities are the ones that will continue I I mean that's why Doge is still around there's a community of Doge lovers community of you know Sheba lovers um but like there's been other meme coins that have come out uh and then I think like the other thing that a lot of people fall back on a lot you hear this discussion a lot is like well Bitcoin is a meme coin it's just its meme is kind of like transcends absurdity it it's basically just hard money you know digital gold digital cash um yeah and I I think like I guess the reason I was attracted to the goat idea was because of this like meme of it's a meme of a a religion that seems to be being built around an AI bot which tickles me enough because I I there was going back to this book and there's been it's been talked about in like different like sci-fi books there's this book called Archangel protocol there's a series of them by Lita morous I read it it's like in 2001 but it it it had some interesting interesting uh ideas about like cybernetics and like implants and like Elon esque kind of brain implants and how those uh allowed people to manifest uh angels and manifest God and uh I guess I'll read the the sleeve it says first the link an interactive implanted computer transformed Society then came the Angels cybernetic manifestations that claimed to be working God's will but former cop deer mcmanis has had her link implant removed for Crime she didn't commit and she's never believed in the Angels but all that will change when a man named Michael appears at her door uh so yeah I I remember reading this and I think it tickled me enough to be like oh this is kind of a interesting uh thought about like how Tech and religion might converge again in the future um and it just seeing some of this AGI stuff and AI stuff kind of come back and then movements being built around it it very yeah truth is uh Stranger Than Fiction I also think Corbin that the when I hear the um I would say Zeal in your voice you also have the uh you have the sound of someone who has bags that are performing well so I think also the fact that I am talking my book absolutely no no no just just but I also talk Bitcoin and eth book so go buy those too yeah no no no no I'm just saying what is it what did they say that uh price price price moves sentiment or Price yeah proce this thing DS tomorrow it's it's it's a stupid idea next week the dumbest thing ever like of course it's [Laughter] stupid God damn it I want to feel that I want to feel that uh that pleasure again God damn it it'll happen my bags my my memes will pump all right um shall we move on from meme coins to other to generally uh General bullish sentiment and happenings in the crypto Market I think we've got a few topics here uh one of which is the US presidential election so yeah what do we have here I think maybe we can start with could you start with the very last thing I put up which is from um what's his face from Black Rock is the bid prediction a trump Victory it's the very last one yeah not that one not that one not that one there he is yeah okay so this is this is like a tldr of of where I'm going to go with this talk but I just going to give you I'm have to just a sec I'm gonna have to the chungus are we uh are we talking about a chungus coin here I remember seeing a few of those now this is but um that's for I must say in the last 12 days the market and the inside of the market um is very convinced Trump is going to win you can see it in the bank stocks you can see it in crypto you can even see it in djt his social media company but throughout the whole I would say the industries that are deregulated if if we had deregulations will benefit from Trump or outperform the others so if you put a gun to my head and thank God there's not one in my head so this really doesn't matter I would say that um I I would have to guess Trump is the favor to win the election now but who knows what these polls even mean all right so I just to start it's an interesting idea that has been said a lot on CT and and Tra traditional fight Twitter is it whatever that's called fin twit um that uh the markets are are showing that they have confidence uh that Trump is going to win um and then here's duck and Miller basically echoing that sentiment um and so um it it's an interesting take where where you can look at the markets to see and try to glean from it um feelings of of basically like a poll um so I thought that was interesting now this all started though like like he said 10 days ago or so I think last week we saw um Trump start to break away from Kamala Kamala and PE at first people and the the mainstream media were like oh this is this is just some right-wing you know uh crypto favored alt-right space favoring their candidate but then um that started to change early this week I I mean do you guys remember the crazy I think crazy Harris's pandering to black men thing that came out yeah start the week yes and and again when I read that to me it it meant desperation right so whether the mainstream polls are showing that she's losing by such a wide margin or not when she starts doing when you start doing this kind of stuff like such such it just doesn't seem very very smart thing to do um I think just given the timing too there's how many weeks left until the actual election so there's not like if you blunder right now there's not a lot of time to recover yeah and so the interesting thing about that Harris pandering to black men thing is it also explicitly talked about crypto right which and and it did it in like the most infantilizing way possible right it was like it really weird it was like we need to make sure that black men who are investing in crypto have their funds make sure their funds are safe or something like that right wasn't that the they have the investor protections uh yeah so they can benefit from which whatever I mean you there's always this like backhanded racism in the Democrats talk it always kind of quite condescending to me yeah it's just like wait wait wait patronizing you saying they're bad Traders or like what's happening here are you saying yeah here it is protect cryptocurrency Investments so black men who make them know their money is safe so they need they need yeah it's just really so they in particular need protection it's just a weird whatever it is even giving smoke to black people and then it's just ice cold to everyone else where you're like what the [¬†__¬†] I I think it's really rude to black people I think it's coddling it makes them out to be infants right like they can't take care ofs like who kind of man wants to hear that weird yeah yeah so Harris is pulling away sorry Trump is pulling away in the uh in the poly market and uh I haven't seen other polls the market is also pointing towards a trump win yeah but then but then so then you have another one so that came out earlier in the week and then after that I don't know if you guys saw the so Harris went on Fox news for an interview again uh reeks of desperation right like many people in the mainstream media were predicting that Harris would never do an interview again after she did the interview with I don't know 60 minutes I guess or whatever CBS and now she's doing a Fox news interview I I it just seems like a desperation like and then it was a terrible interview I actually saw that uh the Trump campaign just published the entire interview as an ad and that's it okay so so the current prices of the current or sorry the the current uh what do you call it the points the points for Trump is what what's the current like uh what is it 60 6040 on poly markets or where we po Market yeah so 6238 so I guess at what point are you guys picking up easy money like because in theory right if thing goes if like at 6040 if you trust this thing at what point do you just say I'm going to throw a big bag in and you know pick up pick up the difference once it hits at 100 no no no no no no no of course not I'm not I'm not [¬†__¬†] um I mean like if Trump hits 70 are you just going to throw a bag in and be like I might be able to pick up a cool 30 a bet I already placed I placed a yeah yeah I placed a bet weeks ago so I'm fine yeah yeah guess placed it when it wasn't like this well at what um percentage odds in his favor would you be putting more money in to be like I'm GNA clean up that difference as he goes in because like there's two what two weeks three weeks left in theory you could be like all right I'm gonna I'm gonna put a bag in at you know once he hits 80% it's a it's a it's a shoe end the only thing that would you know I guess screw you as if like uh you know I don't know I think at 80% I would take the side of the BET Corbin I would yeah yeah yeah CU because then the the risk reward is like it's it that seems way too um confident don't you think 80% like I don't think the country is that that much in favor of I still think it's going to be Reon yeah all kinds of shenanigans ahead as well yeah yeah yeah yeah I would if it was 8020 I would jump in in with a small bag on kamin cuz I you know I want to make money on that um I know who I'm voting for obviously so that's a different thing but 8020 yeah gota got that's I I personally I feel like most of these polls at least like historical polls in every election not just like the US ones but uh the media benefits from a poll being you neck and neck it's always a neck and neck race it's a [¬†__¬†] neck and neck most of these races are probably you know that who's a better candidate who's more likely you know especially this one it doesn't it feels like they're really pulling at The public's opinion to try to make it feel neck and neck but it's like these are different candidates in different leagues this is like watch it feels like watching a NBA player dunk on like an WNBA high school team like farm team or something like that it's just it's really it's almost uncomfortable to watch because you're like this is really bad this is really bad for the other team I feel kind of bad it's is embarrassing she was you have to admit though Corbin she was on point at the the only debate I mean she they they prepped her well and you it's reflected in the uh poly Market bedding thing you can see Trump was doing really well and then post debate went down and then now I mean now that that I'd also be curious about the stock of some of those Bluetooth earrings as well you know how do they do around that time but still I think it's interesting it's very interesting in uh that the markets are outside of po Market just the markets in General stock market and and then you know crypto markets seem to be indicating that they also agree with a trump win uh pretty heavily so um something to watch if you start to see the markets tank uh maybe that's an indicator that uh Harris has more yeah something up sleeve or something another data point here that's quite interesting is the the Bitcoin ETF uh inflows are ramping up again we had the biggest day since June half a billion inflow I believe uh just a few days ago and it's been several days of positive inflows since then and we have uh a tweet here from pentoshi if the buying continues at this rate for BTC ETF we're going to end up with a lot of people on the sidelines in the very new near future if we see the same amount next week as shown here we'll we'd probably get a god candle into new all-time highs and that pentoshi is a legendary crypto Twitter influencer and Trader so condolences to his uh his father who passed away a couple weeks ago oh I didn't know that yeah yeah but yeah very very very uh famous Trader and again he he's showing a an image of just in positive inflows for the past whatever it is five six days something like that yeah all right any other uh bullish points to talk about here I think we had the BTC having tracker did we talk about this there was there was a chart that we had pulled up uh this week at one point regarding uh Google Trend sentiment which was pretty clearly we're at all time lows like nobody's nobody's Googling Bitcoin um yeah now I I guess you could you could say that that's retail right or maybe retail isn't Googling what is bitcoin anymore because they already know what is retail yeah but uh it does make me think that like yeah I possibly uh you know still early sort of uh yeah we'll see um did you want to talk about these stable coins Graham because I think that's probably also uh pretty positive the the inflows for stable coins I haven't checked yeah let's talk about past couple days okay well there's a few things I wanted to talk about here on the stable coins uh one is this let me see if I can make this full screen yeah so um stable coins now are the 20th biggest holder of US debt um just above Germany and just below Mexico um it's still quite a ways off from the likes of Japan and China But Rising in the ranks quickly and uh that's quite interesting we also have this uh chart here which is showing that stablecoin activity has just been uh steady up and to the right uh to the right and up over the last four years despite the spot trading volume in crypto markets in general uh fluctuating quite wildly so we have a big dip in the spot trading volume it's bounced back but all throughout this time stable coin activity just keeps moving to the right and up so stable coins are working that's onein inflows yeah go ahead have you guys explored any of the alternative stable coins that aren't really uh tied to Dollars like I I've been hearing about some oil backed stable coins some gold backed coins uh some silver backed coins um it seems like there's a lot of I mean it's easier than ever to create these types of tokens um and the custody Solutions are almost commoditized to a point where you could off the shelf create your own stable coin on whatever you want this is a this is a vintage car stable coin and we just hold vintage cars in custody and uh this coin tracks that price I guess are you guys do you guys see any potential poal in alternative stable coins to what is like a stable US dollar coin or a stable like Fiat coin to these like alternative real world asset stable coins that that are kind of like emerging it seems well um I I could say just from personal experience that I have used uh gold crypto gold in the during the last uh bare Market I held some crypto gold trying to protect my gains a little bit uh but just this this chart here uh shows that oh no that this chart 99% of stablecoins are are in US Dollars still so there isn't much uptake of stable coins outside of US Dollars thus far for me i' I've heard a lot of criticism about stable coins and specifically stable coins pegged not pegged but um denominated in US dollars or like collateral collateralized in US dollar as not being entirely stable um the problem with all these arguments is that it's more stable than than pretty much everything else right and uh even gold or oil um vintage cards cars stuff like that the the problem is is not that maybe in in certain time periods they appreciate more or or this kind of thing but the liquidity tends to be an issue and then when you have any kind of liquidity events I.E let's say people want to get out of your car back stable coin you'd have to somehow liquidate those cars the liquidity in in in cars is terrible compared to uh to Dollars liquidity in oil is is poor compared to Dollars liquidity in gold is poor compared to Dollars and so you'd get like massive dislocations whenever um a large enough amount of people want to get in or even get out of of I mean get out or or maybe even get in of the stable coin so I don't know I I I don't think right now there's any any alternative but I do think that it'll come I do think there will come a point when stable coins won't be denominated into Dollars it'll but it'll have to be a form that'll be more stable right and that that is the key you have to have a better stable coin than a dollar which there just isn't right now this is where it it seems like there's a a opportunity here for certain countries or certain Banks or Neo Banks to and and you're seeing this you know with P PayPal and Pi was it py USD what are they calling it is it Pi USD or py USD I think it's py py okay I like P okay sure so um but yeah I mean like ultimately if if people are actually just after stability right they they want if they want Fiat US Dollars they're doing these onchain transactions to a Fiat denominated stable coin um but in theory you could just be going from a wallet into a custody account that is US dollars that isn't a stable coin it's just hey you're just selling back into you know a Neo Bank custody Fiat account and you don't have to worry about you know liquidity you don't have to worry about uh say like the the the the tokens soundness or deeg or uh you know trusting some some third party um but it it it does seem like that is sort of contingent on banks getting their [¬†__¬†] together and the market quickly seeing this like okay clearly there's a lot of interest in stable coins just based on all charts right what's stopping the banks under a trump Administration or under you know say a new SEC comes in and they they're like yeah crypto's fine bitcoin's cool you know go go go um how how fast are some of these Neo Banks able to move in and say yeah Bitcoin in Bitcoin out all good no worries we'll figure it out um and maybe that type of service could replace some of the huge uh growth we're seeing in stable coins and it's like stable coins filled the need and they still are filling the and they'll probably still fill the need in the future to a large degree but there is a chance that the banks could chip away at some of that that market share that that seems to be there if the regulatory bodies get their [¬†__¬†] together and if the banks get that permission to go um it'd be kind of interesting to see how how things play out over the next few years yeah I mean there's there's a couple things there um I think I recommended uh in a newsletter like three weeks ago there was a really really good podcast with a forgot a professor who who works who's worked in stable coins helped helped um set up PayPal's stable coin um and he was talking about one one of the big problems that banks have because this came up uh is that the fundamentally the way that they do business is currently not uh amendable to the way that some a business like Circle makes money right so Banks do make money by taking in deposits and then and then and then taking the M that money and making loans or doing other kinds of of a business to basically kind kind of increase the value of that money right through interest payments and stuff like that and um they they don't have have much they don't have much of that money on B on their balance sheet and so they can't really meet redemptions in the same way that someone like Circle or PayPal can which which I think solely um what's it called use short-term money-like instruments so that they they have access to the majority of the liquidity so I think it would require the banks to kind of modify their uh their business which they can do but it's just not exactly what what they're known for doing right now yeah if we think about how uh a business like tether or usdc Circle grew I mean how was it it was it was by um taking deposits from people who wanted to Mint the coin and they just gradually just took in more and more deposits right now for a bank to do that they would have to have people who want to convert dollars into crypto dollars and like is that what is that what A bank's clientele is I mean they already have the thing they want so like the reason usdc and usdt were able to grow is because there was these crypto people who wanted to like have a a a crypto Dollar in the on the blockchain but it just doesn't make sense that that A bank's customers would want that so yeah I don't see it as being likely maybe like a bank offshoot like when maybe a very large Bank could have a subsidi that does this but the bank itself it's it's almost like a completely different business model I think yeah I I think um when I when I think of the potential there it's less will a bank like will you go into a bank to do this no uh it's more like they'll offer the sdks or apis to tech companies to integrate so that it's easier for a wallet to have a a custody you know Fiat account um that that you can just deposit crypto into that that would be kind of how I foresee it it's not less like oh you're going to open up your you know TD Canada Trust account uh who by the way I think they they were just in a whole buttload of [¬†__¬†] because they were supporting some laundering isn't that funny was a was pesky Canadian Banks what a bunch of gomers um money laundering for cartels for drug cartels it's ridiculous but crypto is the problem guys um yeah they also got a slap on the wrists they had to pay a fine nobody meanwhile CZ jail unbelievable yeah yeah the uh they really hate us they really hate crypto people but if you're in the if you're in the cool kids Circle if you're in the uh you're in the trafi bubble we got your back don't worry you know nothing to worry about here um but yeah what I was saying is that I I don't see people kind of like logging into their bank account I think banks just move at like a extremely slow pace for that type of innovation you you'll maybe get a couple Neo banks that could do that like uh you know the the robin hoods or the um what are all those European the Euro poers use revolute yeah they love that revolute out there um you know I I think like Neo apps and neobank apps like those will probably be the first to do this type of stuff but it's all like under the hood um you'll have these like bank sdks that yet could integrate into a website or into an account or into a c or into a a DEX or into a self- custody wallet and then in theory that becomes kind of like the touch point with it it might be powered by XYZ Bank uh but it's you know fundamentally just like the crypto app and it's just a partnership more than it is a um you know the banks support crypto now um that's kind of how I would see that potential challenge occurring uh less less like banks are now your wallet sort of thing all right uh we have 10 minutes left shall we move on to show and tell or does anyone have another topic they'd like to discuss before that just very briefly um all through CT for the past couple weeks I don't know if you guys have seen this conversation amongst eth people really spurred on by salana folks uh very outspoken salana folks like Ani but it's kind of come to a head I think this this past week about whether ethereum main net should be um should be scaled uh and I believe that vitala kind of finally stepped in and um kind of said that he he's on the side of of people who support scaling the uh ethereum main net um and and kind of the main argument on the other side of why this shouldn't be the case is about solo validators right like individuals like you and me running running nodes and and how it it kind of threatens decentralization if if you uh keep increasing the hardware requirements um and so I thought it was interesting though that that basically this this argument has seemingly collapsed after vitalic the god of ethereum has kind of weighed and be like yeah scaling is is pragmatic you know we should we should kind of do that I was just wondering if you guys have any thoughts on on this uh in which side do you support um I don't think it's reasonable to expect the entire uh this financial Network this like Global smart computer to be validated on everyone's home computer and uh I think that this video we're watching here of this old guy getting protected into the end zone is uh is quite apt it took me it took me a minute to figure out what was going on there um I like that though it's great yeah yeah there's a lot of theatrics I think with uh some of the solos taking but you know I think it's still it's still useful I don't I don't see it being like a problem I I do feel like um the goal of this whole crypto thing was to enable anyone to use you know like to unlock some of the things that traditionally uh you know Boomer Bankers had access to or institutional investors had access to and whether that was like yield products or you know icos or what what IPOs and stuff like that like normies can't get into a lot of this stuff um but a normies should be able to get into anything in crypto and I I I I do agree with the sentiment that Bringing Down the the minimum or the yeah the minimum eth requirements for staking yeah good good is it helping I don't know but it's still good it's still good in the sense that providing people the opportunity to earn um permissionless decentralized yield from the base protocol it brings more people in and it it lowers the bar where it's not just you know market makers and high net worth individuals that are just gobbling up the yield uh opens up the opportunity for someone you know Middle America you know just got off their meth addiction and they're now holding one eth and they want in on that that juicy three and a half% apy good get them in there maybe it'll help them get off the streets and focus on you know A New Path um but it slows down the entire ethereum network yeah I mean you don't want to slow anything down right do it better but like let the meth heads in yeah well they better get a data center I think the idea is their backyard they already got like the the tech to make meth in their Trail trailers why are you be to set up I think the idea is as minimum Hardware uh levels increase then you should kind of increase it there right like like what is at least at least yeah a laptop you buy today at Walmart is going to be sign I think it's significantly um higher uh spec than the minimum requirement for for that ethereum is is um targeting right now so like aren't they targeting like raspberry pies and stuff I mean that just seems yeah guys I just saw a tweet I just saw a tweet winter mute which is one of the largest market making companies is now holding 1% of goat what does that mean CeX listings coming soon yeah no I mean you started to see some VCS uh include memes in their portf folios right like legitimate high quality VC and funds pretty wild yeah I think what's interesting is the VCS are coming in late right which is the yeah if it does feel fair right you're not uh they're not getting the special treatment they're just buying at spot which if you were insane enough to take a bet on a meme you might stand a benefit from so congratulations yeah what I heard was um that that a lot of VCS and funds they missed the runup in Bitcoin this year and because yeah and they were like heavily weighted into ethereum like me and so as a um trying to trying to make sure that their LPS are happy and they're not getting like major outflows they've gone out on the risk curve uh because their their bets hav't haven't paid off yet is that the Pod gentlemen it's the Pod David do you like pods that's the pod that's the podcast yeah it's great in a pod great podcast great podcast all right wait wait wait hold on you should show that you should show that Boomer parents thing so we can parents thing and show and tell you can hit off hit the Boomers okay yeah we can talk about this for a minute yeah this this was uh going around oh I like that one so um I someone someone complaining a millennial I guess complaining about uh you know how they're just like barely scraping it by and then scraping by and they found out that their like their in-laws have like $20 million or something and uh then that in-law was like oh yeah they're doing better I guess they're doing a little better than us a little better than us so any than me yeah than me yeah so uh the this person this uh Millennial was like uh just not too happy about uh not getting the support they want they they think they're entitled to I guess from their parents so I don't know my take on this was like uh well congratulations you've got rich parents uh so I don't know well I I I think the the worry that probably most you know poor Millennials have is that their parents are probably I you have a 5050 chance that your parents being wokies and they might just give all that money away when they die and it's like Mom Dad I'm struggling here and you're giving it to plann Parenthood what the [¬†__¬†] so I I think uh they're rightfully pissed off I mean like there's a lot of um the sentiment is very negative towards the Boomer class who are kind of like at least in the internet culture what I see is that everyone's very upset with the fact that Boomers will go out of their way to educate their kids and grandkids that uh just pull yourself up by your bootstraps you know by the time you're 20 you'll have a house and a farm and you know a brand new Cadillac um and it's just like that's not the world you live in anymore man um you got people working two or three jobs doing Uber deliveries and you know only fans on the uh on the side and everyone's poor inflation's wrecking people and these guys are just cozy on their boats with their you know Lakeside Cottages being like aren't you guys just working hard at work for me I don't understand what's going on and it creates this resentment and you know it's very um like a Roman Empire had the the plebians and the patricians right you you had like like 500 500 BC 500 after AC I don't know when it was the but you know you the pores you know basically like the Millennials of the day no voting power they're just like hanging out in Rome you know basically being everyone's like [¬†__¬†] they're their slave they're they like you know you know serving food whatever they are they're just like the servant the servant class right and then you've got the patricians just you know the wealthy Elites being like I don't understand why these guys are complaining you know we we we had a pretty good life they should have a good life what's what's going on and it took like two or 3 hundred years before the plebians even were able to like start impacting any Vote or any any changes in in the Roman Empire so like Millennials I don't know maybe maybe that class dies off but some of them some of them are just going to do the inheritance thing and then you you'll have the Millennials with a big fat bag and then they'll be saying and like well just wait until we die and then I don't know we're in a weird we're in a weird cycle in this whole uh civilization uh I don't know I'm bullish on crypto not so bullish on civilization yeah yeah well I could say that uh I certainly would be um helping out my kids uh that being said I just find this distasteful that this person's complaining online about like their parents not giving them money just I get that I don't know I I mean did you read it Graham though like he the the guy has has got a wife and two kids and they both work hard and they have like a stressful life it seems like and then their parents have the the means to help it just seems bewildering why they wouldn't if if you take them you know take it to be true all I'm saying is it's just to be complaining about that on the internet I don't know just just sad but but they're also on Reddit so you kind of know what type of person they are so my uh so so the reason I was I was asking mainly though is so anecdotally amongst the people that I know uh I don't think this is true so I was trying to gauge whether whether this is just like some extreme internet thing Echo chambery kind of thing or is it an actual does does this really happen because it just seems like so out there to me that that it wouldn't even be I wouldn't be surprised if it was just like a lie or something do you when you say you you you know exactly anecdotally are you saying that you don't have like friends that are in tough positions or no I don't have I don't have so for myself and uh and my relationship with my parents and then the friends I have and their relationships with their parents the parents aren't hoarding a lot of money uh and then like withholding it from their kids you know so I don't really know anyone like this really I don't think um so it I was surprised to see that like it just seems crazy I suspect I suspect like I suspect it happens more in the cities like the larger somewhat more blue cities that uh you've got like I'm just speaking of Canada Toronto you didn't have to do much to make a million dollars you just had to buy a house in the 80s or 90s and just live in it and now you're potentially a millionaire or a multi-millionaire if you bought you know a rental unit at some point you know in the 90s uh you're probably doing pretty good uh you know Vancouver similar Vibes uh you know you got all of these uh say the Immigrant class coming in buying up all the homes driving up the prices and then uh you know the boomers are kind of like hey I had a shitty house that's now suddenly worth way more than it's actually worth you know because you look at these they're they're complete trash nobody nobody in their right mind would be like a million dollars for a bungalow like the [¬†__¬†] so um I think I think in those States or those cities it's it's a lot more um more common to have that like oh these people are pretty cozy and your kids are like serving coffee at Starbucks and then yeah you probably do have that resentful like you know communist vibe from you just being raised in that in that putrid putrid Petri Bishop of crap so tell us what you really think Corbin I love Vancouver as you can see but I mean if all you're if you're you're rich because you have a a house that went up in value a lot you're not really rich because you would have to sell that house and then move somewhere where real estate is cheap so I guess like yeah you could you could sell your house and like move into a like an RV I guess and uh live out your golden years or you move into one of these like you know glass condos and you know but those are just as expensive right like or you do what you do in Japan which which I've I've seen happen many many times is the parents sell the house uh and then they move in with and they're they're you know old they move in with their kids and their kids take care of them and then they die and then you know that's the normal thing to do in Japan is you don't send them to like some old person's home the parents basically give all their wealth and then they live with the the kids for like 10 years or whatever so yeah I mean in Vietnamese culture uh the firstborn son is expected to have their parents move in with them and it's uh it's kind of cool in the sense that I they have this guaranteed safety net uh but in addition to that if the parents did do well in their early investments in some ways that family does kind of get to live on the the coattails of mom and dad for a little bit you know whether that's you know we're going to sell some of our land and we're going to move in with you guys and this new house that you guys have built um and you know we'll just take this little like mother-in-law suite and uh you guys have the main house and we're we're cool you know you guys you guys have a big family it's just us too you know we just need yeah you know also very similar in Japan I've been I've been around a lot of like situations like this and you know I have old people in my family when you get old like seriously you're not doing much really I mean like you're just not doing much uh it's it's pretty pretty interesting to see up close so I don't know bizarre all right we veered off uh sorry I was gonna ask would you guys ever let your parents move in with you yeah I probably would if I if they gave me their money and stuff yeah I'll be like all right mon game here maybe well no just because it's a burden right like I've seen it up close and personal it's it's it's not uh it's not an easy thing to do you want to you want to make sure that you have the help and everything like that involved too right like it's not um if you are having kids there is some benefit there right where you've kind of got defin a livein babysitter you know with Grandma or grandpa um which is kind of nice I'm talking about like a little farther on when the parents start you know requiring diapers and you cleaning beds and stuff you know that's uh it's a whole another thing but you know you do it yeah Graham you flying your parents out uh it's it's hard I mean it's it's easy for me to say yes but like it's so unrealistic uh it's like that's true my mom has like never even left uh Saskatchewan so like come come to ishigaki but I would I would I'd be down with uh uh like having a compound uh like where my uh where my in-laws live in one house and uh I live in another one like within the same property I'm down for that yeah I think that's that's the way to do it like if you're if you're living in the same kitchen and the same you got to see them every morning might be a bit much but if you got like a a corner a suite you know a yep little uh exactly Shack that you can throw them in you know a nice Shack Japan often Japan often makes the first floor they'll have a three floor house and the first floor will be like exclusively for the old the olds they'll even have their own entrance no stairs right yeah exactly there's no stairs they have their own entrance there's a little like kitchenet and whatever and then the rest of the family lives on the second and third floor all right so token narratives get your token cry Bitcoin uh crypto and uh

worst performers across the top cryptocurrencies now let's have a look at what's driving all of this who's actually selling here and does it make sense to buy the dip in the end crypto is all about buying low and selling high and obviously we aren't very high right now in IMX so here's the top 100 tokens and IMX is the second largest loser in the last week we've already talked about apoin on this channel just a few days ago and I am covering IMX quite extensively this is not my very first video so feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly now let's have a look at the onchain analytics to see who's actually buying and selling here before we do this let's first have a look at the situation it was not just the last week that was bad for immutable X the token got sold off the entire last month minus 26% while Bitcoin during the same time stayed flat or even slightly went up now here's the elephant in the room it's token inflation it's allocation of IMX tokens to early investors to the team to marketing Etc where an expanding Supply comes a depressed price if the demand doesn't grow as quickly and the issue simply is that the circulating Supply grew that much it went from 80 million in October of 2021 to 1.7 billion in a matter of 3 years so an expansion of more than 20x of the supply now let's have a look at the holders on chain on ethereum we've got 93,000 holders but not all holders are created equal let's check out the number of retail investors versus whale investors over time on the left side we see the number of wallets with at least 1,000 IMX tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $11,000 that's what I'd consider retail and we've seen retail accumulate quite consistently and now the growth seems to be stalling somewhat in the last 6 months or so for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's not more than $10,000 a very similar pattern again with the growth some W slowing down on the right we got another 10x so more than $100,000 worth of the token there's roughly 270 such wallets pretty much zero growth in the last 6 months again while the supply continues to grow no demand growth but a lot of Supply growth that's why IMX has such a hard time appreciating in price and so the demand and Supply Dynamics are pretty much stable when we look at the number of recurring Traders versus new traders that ratio isn't really changing over time it's hovering at around 25 to 30% of new users relative to returning users and ideally for a quickly growing asset we want to see some days where the number of new users is even exceeding the number of returning users this is not what we have with IMX unfortunately so the token would definitely go up if there weren't that many unlocks the number of buyers tends to be higher than the number of sellers most days and so if the team wasn't to always dump the token we'd be way way higher look at this the number of buyers tends to be at around 60% or so most of the time number of sellers is only around 40 right we tend to be hovering around that line not around 50 so the sellers simply sell more than the buyers buy the price isn't appreciating even though the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers now crypto is all about risk versus reward and obviously there is a lot of risk in IMX nobody is buying or let's say fewer people are buying compared to how the supply is expanding how much upside is there that's a big question because we don't really know what to compare IMX to if you just look at the gaming Market IMX is already the largest of the tokens in terms of market cap have a look at this this is a comparison of various crypto gaming tokens ordered by market cap IMX is at 2.1 billion Floy is a mix of gaming and meme coins the next real gaming token is beam and that's 0.9 billion x infinity is 0.7 billion Gala is 0.7 Etc so there's a lot of potential pressure for IMX to get closer to those other gaming tokens why does IMX have to have two and a half times the market cap of beam or XI infinity or Gala unfortunately profits are not currently made in crypto gaming they are made in memecoins now why is everybody so hyped about meme coins it's because of the upside right we want to have a lot of upside of course there's also a lot of downside with meme coins but at least we can make a multiple X returns if that happens with IMX I'm not sure at $2 billion check out the top performing categories in the last week it's meme coins on ton it's the pump fun ecosystem it's AI memes Etc what is not performing well it's the technical stuff it's zero knowledge proofs it's data availability it's decentralized identifiers Etc nobody wants to hear about play to earn or social F or the metaverse and so it's important to have some kind of a market Edge right if we want to gain in crypto long term we need to have information that most other people don't have and what I like to do is I like to track what other successful Traders are doing and what other influencers are doing and in premium so the link is down below it's zon.com in premium we are tracking various influencers various whales and we see how one particularly successful whale is accumulating the book of ethereum token so that started at the end of June of this year and then continued further and further a lot of dollar cost averaging into this token it seems to pretty much never stop and thus the price is going up we are of course discussing this in premium in various dedicated altcoin channels so that's in Telegram and so yeah this is what happened with book of meme more than 1,000% return in the last year and 76% in this month alone and again we talk about this already for many months this is not luck right this is about tracking people that know Things Early that buy a toen then afterwards promote it on their YouTube channel we want to be buying together with the influencer in order to then sell this potentially to the audience as the influencers do now I personally never pump and dump on this channel I never buy a coin before making the video I always buy the coin after making the video but I am okay to sell to other people's audiences so we are tracking for example Alex Becker's wallet he's got more than a million followers we are tracking crypto gains who also has a pretty good track record at pushing up prices once it's published on YouTube We also tracking James win in total we've got 433 wallets now that we are tracking and so this book of ethereum trade is simply just one of many examples there's also an entire video course on how to find other wallets and on how to track them and on how to interpret those signals so that's over here feel free to stop this video and check the titles in total there's more than 100 different tutorial videos now there's a money back guarantee as well so here for you to check it out if you don't like what you see simply message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% now I don't have a crystal ball either I do not know where IMX is going but I simply think that the risk versus reward is not worth it I think there's a lot of risk because the token continues to inflate there isn't that much reward because we've got a $2 billion market cap I think all action all profit is now in meme coins especially the meme coins that get promoted in Twitter and in YouTube if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly feel free to to also give this a like it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-yLpOfIN4w,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Immutable', 'Gala', 'Beam', 'JUST',

buying here who's selling here who's driving the price this is the rally I'm talking about we are almost at 70 cents now and the price of colum is rather erratic right we see these random spikes then subsequent crashes now we are in a spike again does this mean that we are going to crash what's causing this now I'm not going to present you the content and the marketing on the website this is not how we can get Alpha how we can get a knowledge Edge over the rest of the market instead let's check out the things most people aren't looking at here's the white paper the final version of the white paper but have a look at this that final version was published in November of 2016 does this mean that Golem is actually a dead project and this is simply just a pump and dump some kind of manipulation let's dive deeper what we've got over here is the GitHub repository of golum so this is the place where programmers submit their code changes and no this is not a dead project there was an update 14 hours ago another one 19 hours ago yesterday 2 days ago 2 days ago so there's still something actively Happening Here the team is still working on this dpin project on the project of distributed GPU power but let's have a look at what's driving here demand and Supply let's have a look at toomics let's have a look at adoption metrics what we've got over here is the active address count for golum a lot of ction in 2017 then a subsequent crash now it's pretty much at zero here's a transaction volume over time very much the same picture social metrics aren't too impressive either the number of Reddit subscribers is rather shrinking but here's a rather positive chart it's just a horizontal line this shows us the circulating Supply so at least there isn't any expanding Supply anymore potentially depressing the price this is the problem with most altcoins most altcoins issue a lot of tokens to the early investors and to the the team that then sells off that then depresses the price this seems to not be the case anymore for golum now there are two versions of the token one of them is on ethereum and that token has 19,6 45 holders there's another version of the token this one has 12,000 holders so it seems like the capital locked up in ethereum and in polygon doesn't seem to be that different but actually once we dive deeper it is very very different I've built a tool to distinguish the retail investors from the whale investors you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool you can pluck in any polygon token in this tool and we can look at what are the people doing access to this tool is available for the premium members together with a tutorial video so that's down below the bitcoin.com feel free to check it out and it shows on the left side the number of Wallets on ethereum that hold at least 2,000 tokens at the current price that's a bit over $11,000 that's what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now $10,000 worth of of the token on the right side we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token now those are very long-term charts let's have a look at the same thing just for the last month that's over here and we see actually quite a bit of accumulation by the whales the number of wh wallets grew by more than 20% maybe 25% medium-sized retail grew to a similar degree small retail grew a bit less and that then explains a price development like this at least to a degree there is something that I don't like here but before we get into that let's first look at the polygon based token right there's the ethereum based token and the polygon based token and remember how the number of total holders was a bit over half for polygon versus e now here are the same charts with the same thresholds for polygon much much less more than 3,000 holders with 2,000 tokens on ethereum only 20 such holders on polygon the same difference can be seen obviously for mediumsized retail and for the whales so for whatever reason there are a lot of wallets of this token on polygon but they all have minuscule amounts of it I don't know why that is but it is something very distinct I've never seen this relationship mismatch that massively now let me show you the thing that I do not like so much about this rally it's nice that we do see some accumulation on ethereum and it's also nice that we see this across the board both with the retail people buying but also with the Wes buying and with the Wes potentially buying even more that being said the price movements tend to be accelerate now and that acceler duration might not be natural because again the holder numbers grew by 20 to 25% the price grew by 220% in the same time period and the answer to this puzzle might be over here this is the Perpetual Futures Trading volume so that's the levered bets on the price and there is a ton of trading volume on binance there's xt. comom and binance XT is simply just a Rebrand of binance this is more than a billion dollars worth of trading volume in the last 24 hours alone and that's for a market cap of 650 million so that's not yet two or three times the market cap that's being traded that would be clear manipulation but it's definitely elevated there is some hot air in this rally as well so does it make sense to hold colum potentially maybe with a trailing stop loss in case we do see a deflation temporarily we do see accumulation that's good but we also see involvement by centralized exchanges which I don't like that much if it's your first time here feel free to

because I don't just like to analyze various cryptocurrencies I like to also share my knowledge share how I personally do my due diligence and with Chinese spread we've got some really nice finding so this is how it usually goes we go on a page such as Tech screener and we look at the top tokens and what we can find on the base chain is that one of the top tokens is Chinese bread it had more than 4,000 traders in the last 6 hours it had more than $2 million that got moved and when we look at the chart this is also very enticing an increase of 31% in the last 24 hours who wouldn't be interested in buying this especially when we look at the security scan because there's Pages such as Dex tools I owe and on that page and the bottom left we can see a security scan 86 out of 99 looks relatively proper it's not a Honeypot everything seems Green Let's have a look at the website that looks quite legitimate as well quite typical for a meme coin the Twitter has 1,557 followers also looks quite legit with some nice art what's important when looking at all of those different data points is whether or not they tell a coherent story is there potentially some manipulation in some of those numbers and here is one number that stands out have a look at Bas scan.org this is the Explorer page of the token and in here we've got almost 150,000 holders now that's a lot of holders considering there's only 1,500 followers on Twitter let's have a look at the telegram that only has 700 subscribers why would the telegram have 700 subscribers when there's more than 1,500 holders probably those holders didn't buy themselves maybe there was an airdrop across the board but let's look deeper here's the token distribution that also looks quite nice the main wallet is a debt wallet so that's burnt tokens all the other wallets have a rather small share of the token this piece of the pie over here is simply just other accounts right so this is a widely distributed token there's no major wals crashing the price potentially apparently so here's a chart from a tool that I've developed myself this shows the number of holders over time and there's no minimum holding threshold and we see here two big spikes is this onchain manipulation is this an airdrop we are going to find out here's the number of wallets that have at least $1,000 worth of the token so yes this is going up but just have a look at this number right this is 800 only 0.5% of all wallets have more than $11,000 in this now let me show you some kind of manipulation here let's have a look at the very right over here this is the number of buy transactions versus sell transactions to today and the number of buy transactions and the number of buyers especially is exceeding the number of sellers massively while the buy and sell volume is relatively in equilibrium this gives us a first idea of potential wash trading of a potential artificial inflation of the number of buyers because again there isn't that much Capital that's flowing in but there are a lot of people that are getting in apparently but let's have a look at the actual transactions again this is on Dex screener and let's dive into the history what do we see here we see a lot of buy transactions that are worth less than one cent look at this at this at this this is a lot of transactions within a single minute and just see how many transactions there are with less than one cent worth this is not natural whatsoever right and all of those transactions with less than 1 cent are also new wallets so this is what we can see here with the star Whenever there are stars over here this is a new wallet and so those are all small Plankton wallets so wallets that buy less than a scent that are all new so a lot of newly created wallets Buy in here for less than a scent artificially inflating the number of buyers artificially inflating the number of buys artificially inflating also the number of holders and thus pushing up the asset in the ranking on Dex screener so if you go to deck screener and you look at the chain of your choice like Bas and you sought it by number of makers or by the volume that's been traded suddenly we see Chinese spread here it's one of the top tokens and again that's because of manipulation directly on chain am I saying that Chinese bread will crash from here no I'm not saying that but what I am saying is that the numbers that you usually look at such as the number of holders Etc that is manipulated the trading volume on this token that you see on chain is not natural so when Chinese bread is at number one of all of the tokens that's probably not natural and because of all of that wash trading I would also be very very much surprised to ever see this token on any centralized exchange centralized exchanges tend to not touch those kind of meme coins you need to have somewhat of a more natural distribution of the token you don't want to see too much manipulation because the centralized exchanges they hold some tokens themselves as well right they don't just hold the tokens in the name of the customers they tend to also hold tokens themselves for Market making and they don't want to be exposed to a rck pool either again I do not know if this project will rock or not but still I don't think that everything here is natural if this is done by the team itself or by someone else I do not know but I definitely don't want to touch this token I think there's too many tokens out there there's no need to get into something that risky if it's your first time here feel

week where nothing is happening in crypto there's one token that's standing out and that's Renda Renda performed the best in the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the last week let's have a look what's driving this let's see who's buying and selling this let's see who's driving the price here because in order to make any kind of price prediction we need to know is this currently manipulation is this currently natural demand what's actually the potential upside so have a look at the table behind me this is the top one 100 cryptocurrencies render is at number one when ordered by the top performance in the last 7 days and so that's plus 37% this week plus 470 this month and since listing on coin market cap in the middle of 2020 we went from 5 cents all the way to more than $10 now an increase of more than 26,000 per. now there had been our ups and downs and so let's have a look at what potentially caused those movements to the down side and what matters most is of course relative valuation because when Bitcoin and ethereum goes down then render is likely going to go down as well so let's have a look at how is render actually doing relative to ethereum for example check out this chart this starts in November of 2021 and first render did not do that well render relative to ethereum dropped by more than 80% so have a look at this this is how you search for this in trading view you enter render usd/ us DT so we get the relative variation to e but then something happened then we recovered similar to the levels one year ago and then you see here this vertical line something specific happened here as well that vertical line indicates when the token inflation for render massively declin that's always the problem with altcoins right altcoins in general tend to be very inflationary a lot of new tokens get printed that then gets allocated to early investors and to the team Etc they might then sell some of those tokens but potentially depressing the price but since that vertical line that doesn't happen anymore or let's say it happens to a smaller degree because this is the middle of June 2023 and check this out this is the number of circulating render tokens over time and this here is the middle of June 2023 so the token inflation massively went down there isn't that much new render hitting the market anymore but check this out check out the end of 2021 that's the beginning of this chart right this is when we saw the massive dump so an increase in the supply leads to a decrease in the price at least relatively speaking to other cryptocurrencies relative to ethereum and so that's a positive sign right since at vertical line the token inflation went down and since then Renda was able to outperform potentially continuing as the project gets developed further and gets more and more adoption now let's have a look who's driving those kind of prices is this retail buying in or is this the Wales potentially manipulating the price what's happening let's have a look at onchain data most people aren't considering there are two tokens of render that have some kind of adoption one is on ethereum one is on polygon let's look at both this is the ethereum based token and let's check out the largest holders the very first holder is a contract address that has now 27% of the entire Supply and that tends to reduce in its balance so it went from 225 million tokens to now 143 million tokens so this is probably a location to the team Etc this is expected to continue to go down but then let's have a look at those labeled wallets right the bridges Etc aren't really that interesting let's have a look at binance and at okx here's the balance of the binance wallet over time so binance is accumulating either for their own Market making or simply for custody because a lot of customers might potentially buy this on the platform and then binance has to hatch itself against this right it has to buy them directly on chain so this could be an expression of customer demand on the binance platform this is actually what I expect this to be have a look at this chart this is the balance on okx very similar a very constant increase with the only difference that the rebalance seems to be happening a bit more frequently but let's dive into this a bit more deeper let's look at the number of whale wallets let's have a look at the number of retail wallets are there more more retail investors jumping on this are there more and more whale investors jumping on this what's actually happening so according to Ether scan we've got 91,000 holders of render on chain but when we split this up by minimum holding thresholds so when we say we only want to count the wallets that have at least 100 render tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 then instead of 91,000 holders we've got less than half of that 40,000 holders roughly so that's the number of retail investors here on the left minimum holding 100 tokens in the middle we've got a minimum holding of a th000 token so a 10x from the left chart that's now medium-sized retail also growing quite nicely over time they roughly 10,000 such Wallets on the right side we go another 10x from that that's in holding of $100,000 we've got more than a, such wallets in render also long-term quite constant accumulation let's have a look at the second version of the token this is now on polygon there's 22,000 holders overall but there's only 2,500 holders over 100 tokens 277 holders over 1,000 tokens and very very few whales only 21 even though roughly a fifth of all holders are on polygon most of the capital clearly is on ethereum not on polygon now what happened in the last month where we simply went sideways right in the last week we did pretty well but in the last month not much has happened for the render token here are the same kind of charts on the ethereum Chain just for the last month a lot of accumulation by retail or let's rather say constant accumulation not necessarily A Lot maybe an increase of 5% or so mediumsized retail also grew the whales also grew but with a bit more volatility they sold at the beginning of the month bought at the second half of the month similar to how the price is also moving so the Wales really have quite a bit of impact on the price there is some kind of limit to that analysis and again because a lot of the trading for render already happens on the centralized exchanges most of the trading happens on binance then comes coinbase then comes gate.io still to me it appears said this is not manipulation it looks like people are buying into render both retail as well as Wales this seems to be a relatively stable price development however there is a bit of a risk here and that risk is not specific to render it's related to the altcoin market as a whole I talked about this with the premium members for quite a while now and I want to share this now on YouTube as well have a look at the stablecoin market cap it tended to expand for quite a while and the lacoin market cap does have some correlation to crypto prices it tends to not expand anymore for the last 2 to three weeks so there's no more money flowing into crypto right now if we don't see more money flowing into crypto then maybe the accumulation of render tokens will also slow down and when that slows down and the whales sell because there isn't no more fresh Capital entering then of course the US dollar price of render might go down as well but still in the overall Market I believe render is rather one of the better picks still the altcoin market as a whole is somewhat in a limbo right now at least in my opinion if it's your first time here feel you to subscribe I publish you regularly like would be very much appreciated as

metic token keeps crashing why is that why is there no flaw who's actually selling here let's have a look at some onchain data let's have a look at some relative variations and see whether or not this is a falling knife or a potential opportunity now I've made a video on metic or the P token roughly 1 month ago and what's interesting about this video is that it outperformed the average video so the average video is here in Gray in blue is the polygon Matic video and that happened even though that was a very bearish video and bearish videos tend to do not that well on YouTube right most people want to get their buyers confirmed they tend to give thumbs down when they own an asset and they see something critical however even though that video was critical it's still outperformed now Matic is a layer 2 scaling Solution on top of the ethereum blockchain there now many l2s and so it makes sense to compare the meic price with the ethereum price meic was one of the first of its kind and so in initially it did very well but now the competition increased now there's optimism now there's arbitrum and recently also the base chain and so now we see an underperformance of 87% in the span of only the last 1 and 1/2 years the picture doesn't look that different for Matic relative to bitcoin also here historically we are at an all-time low we have underperformed Bitcoin since launch by 45% now meic is in a tricky situation it's now in a market segment that has very little adoption crypto is now splitting into two directions on the one hand we've got the long-term Bitcoin investors that simply regard Bitcoin as the safest of the monies at the hardest of the monies and that might allocate to bitcoin through the ETF on the other hand we've got the people that actively trade that want to get 10x 100x returns and so everything that's not extremely high risk or that's not Bitcoin that tends to now shrink what we've got over here is the others dominance so this is a measure of how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap is in the altcoins that is not in the top 10 and yes this is fluctuating to a degree but since beginning of the year the field in the middle tended to do pretty poorly minus 33% again that's relative to all the other cryptocurrencies and at the same time the importance of Bitcoin as a fraction of all of crypto continues to rise the Bitcoin dominance is going up this will not happen forever though I believe there might be again a turnaround at one point and that's when we hit the 70% Mark roughly because in the past that's exactly what we have seen whenever Bitcoin was at around 70% of all of cryptocurrency's market cap we have seen very quickly that dominance crashing now when Bitcoin dominance crashes this is simply another sign for the altcoins in aggregate outperforming right now Bitcoin is outperforming most but depending on how quickly this appreciation continues maybe in 6 months maybe in 12 months we will be at a heated stage again where the alt coins including potentially polygon metic could outperform again now we all know the source of that outperformance it's Wall Street money it's money flowing in through the ETFs so that's very positive almost every single day and that's because the grayscale Bitcoin trust isn't selling anymore now only the new instruments see inflows and that's of course supported by the Trump Administration Trump is pro crypto and so Wall Street feels more comfortable allocating to Bitcoin now there is a potential Catalyst for Matic and that is ethereum I was bearish on ethereum for a very very long time but now we could see a potential turnaround and again the reason for this is the ETF ethereum has an ETF as well and that was pretty dormant up until recently in the last 5 days we've seen a lot of inflows and if you annualize the last 7 days we already get at a 7.1% supply absorption so that refers to all of the ethereum supply 7% of it would be absorbed by the ETF if those inflows were to continue now since the merge from proof of work to proof of stake for ethereum if had a very bad time against Bitcoin it went down by 59% but if now ethereum can turn around through those ETF inflows by extension metic might also go up because it could be seen as a levered version on ethereum because it's a layer two now how did we find ourselves in that mess the answer is of course the update of the tokenomics after the move from the meic token to the P token the metic supply was supposed to be kept now it's not anymore after that merge now we see inflation and that's especially problematic when the usage on polygon isn't really that high only $182 Million worth of tokens got traded on polygon in the last 24 hours compare this with Solana that's close to 7 billion now don't get me wrong I'm not a Perma Crypt bear I'm not bearish on crypto as a whole I simply just think that the market is now splitting up we actually see how crypto is currently expanding in we do see how money is Flowing from traditional Finance into crypto have a look at this this is the stable coin market cap over time and this goes up whenever you sent your hard-earned US dollars to a centralized exchange and that centralized exchange might then send this over to tether and tether then creates tokens and this goes down whenever you withdraw right whenever you want to pull your Fiat out and so this crash over here was the Tera Luna collapse this is when USD went Belly Up it started the bare Market it started the contraction and through that contraction also FTX collapsed and then it turned around at the beginning of October of this year and it's now accelerating again but here's the thing crypto is all about risk versus reward and we all know how crypto is very risky thus the upside potential needs to be there and so even though Solana for example is used a lot now I don't necessarily think that it's that great of an investment either because check out the Solana dominance it seems to be peing so I'm not saying that the Solana dominance has to go down I'm simply saying that it might just keep Pace with Bitcoin you might not get this additional risk compensated the market seems to have understood this concept because otherwise how is it possible that the top performing categories within crypto are now the meme coins it's a tokens that can 10x it's the tokens that can 100x the entire pump fun ecosystem so the launch pad of meme coins on Solana went up by 130% in the last 7 days what else went up Elon Musk inspired memes base memes dog themed memes AI memes frog themes it's all memes and we can even drill a bit deeper right what within the meme coin Market performed best it's the tokens with most upside potential so have a look at this in the last 24 hours what performed the best it's market cap 19 million 31 million 128 million Etc it's in the few Millions it's not in the few billions and so really the art of the game is to either simply have exposure to the asset that tends to appreciate most against the rest or alternatively to be very active in trading the things where all the attention is now headed we already know that with an altcoin we can easily lose 90% if that's the case why not buy something that can also 10 x and so here's what performed the best in the last week it's again the pump fun ecosystem and the token that made 1700% in the last week is now at 1.7 billion but one week ago it was at 100 million it's currently at $183 and the first video about that token about the peanut meme coin was published here when it was still at 11 cents and so I got a lot of questions in the last weeks right why do I make so many videos on Meme coins again I believe that's where most of the growth is it doesn't matter whether or not we like it we simply just have to face reality people either just allocate or they actively trade everything in the middle gets crushed and so why not be part of the party while it lasts by the way Peanut is up since that video by 1,500% roughly now to Outsiders this might all seem like random gambling right we buy a meme token that has no intrinsic value and we hope for it to go up why should we do this the answer is those kinds of performances are not random crypto is both a game of luck but also of skill and so when we've got some analytics that most people do not have when we've got information that most people don't have then we can buy better than others we can sell better than others we need to know something that most people don't and so here is my personal approach to this I like to track other people that influence markets and that tended to do the right calls in the past so have a look at this we got an alert that Crypt bent bought the peanut token at 3 cents so that was over here since then the price went up by 6,000 per. now who is Crypt banter Crypt banter is one of the largest crypto channels in YouTube they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token the token goes up through onchain analytics we found 33 of their wallets and we track those wallets we get alerts whenever those wallets buy or sell something I have a look at this this is Alex Becker he's got 1.48 million subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets and so it's all about following the smart money it's all about replicating the people that make money in crypto it's not about random gambling it's not about picking random tokens with funny names on a list and so I believe that much in the strategy that I built a dedicated cost just on wallet tracking how can we find wallets by influencers how can we subsequently track them and how can we finally interpret the signals that we get from the trkking it's eight videos in total it's part of the premium membership but premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's about portfolio diversification it's about back testing there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in premium once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss it we have to figure out when to buy when to sell we have to look at the different onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins in premium as well and so I believe it's important to be part of either segment simply just dollar cost average into Bitcoin or get into active trading if you do want to do the active trading don't just do it randomly do it with a group that does proper analytics it's currently $125 per month there is a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you yes there is a slight chance that the meic token might go up in case ethereum gets supported through the ETF I think the best chances though are when Bitcoin dominance is at 70% and most alt coins outperform Bitcoin at that point before that I simply just bet on the very small meme coins I believe this is where most of the upside is if you got some value video feel you to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see

today as are many other meme coins let's have a look at who's actually selling here does it make sense to buy this dip let's try to figure this out using onchain analytics to actually see is this small retail or is this the Wales that are currently moving the price now we are discussing the Solana based token here so that token is currently at 20 cents the contract starts with ed5 NYY so make sure you get the right one today is pretty depressing but for this week we are still up by 33% and since listing on coin market cap 1 and a half month ago we are up almost 500% now why does it make sense to even have a look at mooding it's one of the largest tokens one of the largest trending tokens on the Solana chain at least when we measure this by liquidity so there's a liquidity pool of 5.7 Millions for moodang alone it's more than half the largest token which is currently Goos maximos we talked about about the gold token several times on this channel as well and so especially for meme coins the question is always what's the potential upside because the downside is obvious it's minus 100% meme coins can very easily crash 60 70 80% but how much higher can it go is it worth to take the risk and the very simple approach to figure that out is to compare market caps so what we've got over here is coin gecko we've got the meme token categories Tab and in here we've got mudang with 200 million roughly in market cap and we can see what would it take for it to double so let's say we were at 400 million then it would already beat a baby Dogecoin and would get close to gigette what about a 3X then it would already beat turbo and get close to Nero now this is probably the maximum upside I do not necessarily think that mudang will beat things like Brad for instance right if we have a 5x from here it would be larger than Brad it would rival flocky Ino and building a base of investors with that much capital in such a short period of time to even beat Floy Eno I don't think that's super realistic it might happen over the course of the next 12 months but it's probably not going to happen in like a few weeks now I've already published two videos on moodang one for the ethereum based token and one for the Solana based token and the video on the Solana based token actually outperformed the typical video not initially but over time more and more people searched for mooding that's positive because that means that retail is interested in the token we want to see retail interest we want to see investor adoption now there's something very important to note here we are going to look at the onchain metric we are going to look at the transactions directly on the Solana chain they are transparent right it's a public Ledger the blockchain but the issue is that not all of the transactions not all of the moodang value is transacted on Solana even though there is a big liquidity pool because have a look at this most trading volume has happens on bitg followed by gate.io followed by mexc radium has only 7% of trading volume radium being the decentralized exchange on Solana unfortunately we can only look into that trading volume only that is transparent and so let's work with what we've got let's try to figure out what actually caused this massive 80% drop and then of course we want to know what's causing this current R let's have a look at the number of firsttime Traders versus new Traders on chain we want to see a growing investor base the more people buy a token the higher the price can potentially go and on the left side we see exactly that the first time Traders are in purple the recurring Traders are in orange and on the 25th of October we have seen 8,625 new wallets buying moodang on Solana we have seen a secondary smaller influx on the 28th of October and since then we tend to rather Trend downwards the 25th was over here right this is when the rally started and so on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day this also peaked somewhat on the 25th and 26th but it's not comparable to what we have seen at the beginning of the month so isn't that interesting there were a lot of token transactions around here not necessarily a lot of trading volume now we see less token transactions but much more value being moved and a lot of people coming in now we can have a look at the trading volume based on different cohorts on the left side in US Dollars on the right side normalized to 100% per per day and we see the massive trading volume Spike on the 25th and now the question is what's causing this is this the Wales is the small retail is mediumsized retail or large retail let's start off with small retail so that's the wallets with up to $11,000 worth of the token we see that the peak on the 25th is roughly double the size a bit more than that compared to the peak on the 27th we can see that the peak on the 25th of October is roughly double the size of the peak on the 27th of September we can see that for medium-sized retail so that's not the wallets between ,000 and $10,000 the secondary Peak is not as large as the first Peak or rather the growth isn't as large right it's only 50% larger compared to the first Peak for the wallets between 10,000 and $100,000 we see a 2X roughly the mega Wales aren't that much involved so that's all the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token now we can see that initially the small retail investor was pushed out of the market as in medium-sized retail and large retail bought up more and more of the token this happened up until the 28th of September the 28th of September was over here we then see how trading volume grew for small retail in other words small retail was attracted by that price appreciation and then bought the bag from those whales we continue to see that small retail is a significant fraction of trading volume however the 25th of October October was dominated by the larger players they costed this rally yet again much faster of course this time compared to the rather gradual rally in September and so it's very important to continue watching the Wales right if the whales aren't getting involved again in mudang and very likely they're going to continue selling off the token as they have done in the past it looks like they're not playing as easy of a game as before they're not just gradually dollar cost everything in it seems like now they do the classic pump and then potentially d we can also see this just today right the number of buyers is larger than the number of sellers yet we see that the price is going down by 10% in other words the sellers move more money than the buyers it's the whales that take some profit now how can we beat the market how can we figure out what those whales are doing I like to use wallet tracking so this channel has a premium membership and we track various wallets of influencers and of top Traders in premium so there's a dedicated influencer trade Channel and over here we see that Arch Lim bought some mudang for 14 cents and that was on the 8th of October we also saw other influencers getting involved for example Kyle chesse we've got 12 of his wallets here's his YouTube channel he's got 133,000 subscribers we've also got wallets by crypto benter 33 of them we've got wallets by Alex Becka also wallets that aren't that well known and we've got six wallets by Paulo Sol we've got more than 400 wallets that we track now overall there's a tutorial course on how to find wallets how to track them and how to then interpret those different tracking signals it's eight videos in total it's also part of premium and it's not just all about wallet tracking it's also about portfolio management about risk management about micro indicators Etc more than a 100 tutorial videos in total now besides the alerts it's always good to also bounce off ideas with other community members right when are they buying and selling and so there are dedicated chats for the individual all coins in premium as well so yes I believe that moodang is somewhat of a dangerous token right now all of the price action is pretty much dictated by the Wales they are now pushing up the price and in the past they have dumped quite heavily suppressed the price by more than 80% if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I publish yous regly I would also very much appreciate if you gave this video a like because that helps the channel grow and of course see you in the next video or potentially in premium

chance that December May outperform November for BTC and crypto prices at least that's according to the numbers here and the charts are objective the charts do not lie the Bull Run really is only just getting started and so in all likelihood we are going to have a strong December possibly one that outperforms November which of course is a good omen for altcoins so far right now and according to the metrics we're still seeing some pretty high BTC dominance but that being said there are some great altcoin projects that are starting to Make Some Noise some of them have started to go on runs already others it looks like have their runs lined up for the month of December and Beyond and that is exactly what we're considering in this video for spectacular altcoins whose fundamentals are very strong but who are just kind of starting to wake up now out of hibernation they're poed to have a terrific December and start to 2025 [Music] welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz all the very best of luck if you choose to invest whether that's into these projects that we're talking about today or any number of other altcoins that we discuss on this channel I wish you well but I'm not a financial or investment adviser just remember that as well as the fact that by extension this video is not official Financial or investment advice all right my first pick for today's altcoins that we're considering and perhaps surprisingly is Dogecoin ticker Doge do o g Dogecoin of course is a meme coin and uh it's certainly mem coin season right now nobody can deny that whatever way you look at it Dogecoin though is the king of the mem coins whatever you think of that space uh Dogecoin really is the Emperor of this Kingdom and Doge has a pretty long history it started all the way back in 2013 as a joke however it wasn't really until early April 2021 that it went parabolic it was dormant for a long time and then in late January 2021 one Doge was almost worth a cent a month later it was at 8 cents and then after that it went on the 4th of April from 5 Cent to 73 cents in a month that was on the 8th of May 2021 uh and right now we're sitting at just below 40s so it's on the way to a new all-time high with a little bit more of a push and if you think about it it was pretty hard to imagine back in 2013 that this joke of a project would have had this kind of success however in all fairness there's no Doge without Elon Musk uh and once he got involved as a personality really that's when Doge skyrocketed whenever he posts about Doge on X the price moves upwards correspondingly and then of course there's more to come with the new and upcoming Trump Administration Elon Musk will have a position there he's going to be leading as you probably know the department of government deficiency or Doge this surely is a reality that is stranger that fiction and the fact of the matter is it's not going to be all that surprising for Dogecoin to go even higher than its current 30 C mark it wouldn't surprise me at all to see new all-time highs later in the season and so with this in mind and with all that free attention that Dogecoin is receiving it wouldn't really surprise me at all to see Doge go higher than 40 cents and make its way up to and Beyond a new all-time high next up here and at number two it's been a while since we've talked about this one we're looking at Stacks ticker STX and as you may already know they are the leading Bitcoin layer 2 but one thing that you may not know uh is that it is one of the best wrapped Bitcoin products with its sbtc wrapped Bitcoin of course is a Hot Topic right now that's thanks to Justin's Sun's takeover of wbtc and the emergence of coinbase CB BTC sbtc is one to1 collateral like other rra tokens however the lack of a custodian is a huge and positive difference here between s sptc and other Solutions with sptc we don't have to wonder what Justin sun will do or if the custodian has all the collateral they claim they do with stacks and sbtc it's all transparent and right there for you to see plus it's all secured by bitcoin's hash rate not by some company's promises and anyone who runs a stack node can be a signer this ensures that sbtc stays decentralized and free of corruption this makes it the Market's most decentralized and disrupted wrapped BTC token and the lack of custodians makes sbtc the most censorship resistant wrapped Bitcoin available that's because sbtc actions take place on the Bitcoin blockchain sbtc is going multi-chain as well soon Zeus will offer sbtc on salana for of users who want programmable Bitcoin for defi also coming soon for sbtc is the full integration with coin flip this means that you're going to be able to withdraw sbtc from their ATMs all around the world when you need liquid cash or you can use the ATMs to buy your sbtc this is going to bring both sbtc and BTC availability to more people in more places sbtc is on the stacks test net now but main net is coming soon and here's that first deposit went with 15 Stacks signers notice at the bottom right you see a Bitcoin block transaction hash this transaction finalizes on the Bitcoin blockchain that's instead of in The Ledger of a custodian like Justin Suns bit Global none of the other popular rap tokens can offer that you can go give it a try or if you know you're ready to buy then go to curve that's where you can swap the sbtc wbtc pair today [Music] at number three here we are looking at cardano ticker Ada and this has been a hot one uh only a month ago we called out cardano and polad Dot as being dinosaurs uh which they are but look at what's happened since then Ada has had a 180% run over the last 30 days not in my wildest dreams uh could I have expected that but we've just been hit with the perfect storm of news for a legacy project like cardano and so here we are today Ada and a couple of other coins from the last Bull Run or other dinosaurs are making massive comebacks xrp dot sand super and a lot of others as well that are doing very very well and Ada even made it back into the top 10 as measured by crypto market cap its current price as I record sits at 97 cents with a 34 nearly $5 billion market cap and out of the 4 billion Ada we have 35 billion or about 80% in circulation and there is a major reason as to why Ada's current price is what it is why it's had the run that it's had on the 10th of November Charles hoskinson announced that he may get an advisory role to president Trump and just in case you don't know him hoskinson of course is the founder and CEO of cardano some are even speculating that hoskinson could find himself in the role of Secretary of the US Treasury I think that one a little bit far-fetched but uh it's been thrown out there as a suggestion at least I think what's much more likely and much more realistic but still fantastic uh would be a position on the newly formed crypto policy team and that would still be great that is already spectacular news my next altcoin pick here is radium last but not least here Ray is the ticker r a y it's a DEX on salana and in all fairness I don't mention radium all that often but uh it probably deserves to be looked at here it's had a very good run over these last 30 days with an uptick of about 64% however if we zoom out further over the course of a year Ray R ay is up 1327 per. but that being said if we zoom out further still uh if you can believe it it's still about 68% away from its all-time high that was in September of 2021 $16.83 whereas the current price of Ray right now is $537 Saul so is also on the rise and so is its ecosystem radium of course is a perfect example of this the predictions for Saul uh go all the way up to $1,000 which is about a 4X from here if that were to be the case I can also see a 4X or better for radium that would also mean a new alltime high radium is a solid amm automated Market maker that allows for fast and lowcost swaps it also provides various liquidity protocols it has a tvl of 2.3 billion do and with that figure it actually ranks in the third spot of all salana D Platforms in fact only goo and Jupiter have a higher tvl on salana you can also stake your ray r a y on radium and use its Bridge all to say that there's a lot to look forward to with this project uh if we extrapolate and look forward to the rest of this bull run okay set four projects here but we have a bonus at number five here in the form of polygon whose ticker is no ER madic it's now Paul p o and in 2022 and part of 2023 I really couldn't get polygon off the screen it established all kinds of new Partnerships it was especially known for that it also rolled out ZK evm and so it was doing great things in terms of these Partnerships uh they weren't just with anybody either they were topnotch uh featured major big Brands big corporations so the likes of mercedesbenz Twitter Starbucks meta Adidas Disney uh and a lot of others too was pretty intense and polygon ZK evm is a layer two scaling solution it uses zero knowledge or ZK proofs and offers low transaction costs however polygon despite all that good news faded a little bit uh however it seems to be working on a comeback right now the maic token ma atic peaked at almost $3 in December of 2021 however it then dropped to 32 cents in late October of this year since that time however it's up about 60% but in October of 2023 we saw the introduction of their new Paul P token you can use this token among all the polygon chains and Paul also saw a 60% increase over the last 30 days its current price is as I record 55 cents with a$ 4.47 billion market cap however in contrast to madic unfortunately Paul has an infinite token Supply this is not a good thing it's never a good tokenomics feature uh as far as projects go but if we can look beyond that there are certainly other positives and by that I mean that polygon is on the rise again so for example game seven Dow crowned polygon number one in gaming with the most titles across ecosystems we saw Solana make the comeback of a lifetime uh in the last couple of years now it's really teetering on new all-time highs polygon seems to be gearing up and some would say it has the same potential to do so let me know whether or not you agree with that Outlook in the comments comments

to know where the price is going but I've been in crypto for long enough to be able to identify extreme situations and Dogecoin is definitely at a very very extreme level right now now in this video I want to show charts that you have probably never seen of do we are not going to look at the US dollar chart we're going to look at dominance charts we're going to look at relative valuation charts to bitcoin and to ethereum and when we look at this and we combine all of those findings it really doesn't look that great now this is where we are currently at and this is the chart everybody looks at Dogecoin is at 36 Cents and it went up by more than 200 100% in the last month and it almost hit an all-time high recently it's very close to its initial trading price from June 2021 now this is not the first video on Doge on this channel I published one a few days ago and we looked at this chart here this is the Doge dominance or how much percent of the entire cryptocurrency market cap is in Doge historically we had been higher at roughly 4% we then crashed down quite a bit by 80% in terms of relevance to less than 1% of all of crypto being Doge and it appears as if we're hitting a resistance over here now does this line have to hold of course it doesn't but it is another potential signal that the air might be getting thin but let's compare more this chart shows the relative valuation of Doge to bitcoin so it Compares had you bought Dogecoin or Bitcoin what would have performed better and for the last year there wasn't really a big difference between Dogecoin and Bitcoin both performed well but with this recent rally we've seen an outperformance of almost 200% now unfortunately this current rally looks very similar to what we have seen in the past let's just overlay is there a bit more upside potential yeah maybe it's maybe a potential reward of 16% but a potential value destruction of 66 maybe even 75% now the comparison to bitcoin is probably not the best because Dogecoin actually is not that well correlated to bitcoin it's more correlated to the other altcoins it's more correlated to ethereum for example when there's more correlation between two assets it means that the two assets tend to move more in sync with one another so when one asset goes up the other asset tends to go up as well and vice versa now this connection isn't as strong for Dogecoin to bitcoin compared to Dogecoin to ethereum that hints that the factors that influence the price might be more common between ethereum and Dogecoin in other words maybe Dogecoin competes for similar kinds of capital that ethereum is made for let me show you what I mean this is a correlation coefficient between different crypto assets and whenever the correlation coefficient is close to one It means that the assets move very much in sync to one another when it's at zero there is no no connection now check this out the correlation coefficient of Dogecoin to ethereum is 0.59 while the correlation coefficient of Dogecoin to bitcoin is only 0.44 this is for the 90day correlation and over time we can see especially in the recent past there is quite a bit of a connection especially when we look at this at the oneyear correlation coefficient ethereum and Dogecoin tend to move in the same ways Bitcoin and Dogecoin has a smaller correlation coefficient and so instead of comparing Dogecoin to bitcoin let's compare Dogecoin to ethereum and that's then the chart that we get we see a somewhat stable trading range also a somewhat tight trading range we sometimes break out above or below but most of the time we are in that trading range now there is one problem here and that's a connection between attention trading volume and price the more attention there is on an asset the higher the price goes the problem in crypto is that attention moves from asset to asset the attention doesn't stay on Dogecoin forever it might move to the next token at some point and so just let me show you what I mean this is the trading volume over time and have a look at what happens when the trading volume spikes for example over here or over here we might still see a subsequent short squeeze sometimes that short squeeze can exceed the prior high and sometimes it doesn't but after that squeeze we pretty much go straight down and so I believe that's very likely going to happen for for Doge yet again now let's say you don't trust in those charts let's say you're still bullish on do or let's say you only want to take part of the profit and you still want to ride this way for a bit longer what kind of upside potential is there realistically speaking how much more outperformance can we get now it's important to think in terms of outperformance because if you simply just mirror the performance of Bitcoin then why even own Dogecoin Dogecoin is much more risky than Bitcoin if you don't get that risk compensated then there's no reason to hold Doge then simply just buy Bitcoin so more risk should equal more reward now how much potential reward for Dogecoin is there now have a look at the market caps Dogecoin is now at the market cap of 53 billion if it was to double it would be larger than Solana there's plenty of people that call for a Dogecoin at $1 but is that likely going to happen is Dogecoin going to have a larger market cap compared to tether which is the largest of the stable coins even after a doubling from here right even with a dolge coin at 70 cents Solana would be smaller and Solana generates a ton of trading volume and revenue in the last 24 hours we have seen 6 billion worth of trading volume on Solana and that currently generates more than 2 million every single day in trading fees is Dogecoin long-term really worth that much don't get me wrong I've got nothing against meme coins but I do believe that there's better opportunities in the meme M coin market now memecoins are actually one of the best performing Assets in crypto right now the Elon mus Inspire tokens went up by more than 114% in the last week the pump. fun ecosystem which is a Launchpad on Solana went up by 113% the Dark theme tokens went up by 82% it's all memes it's all risk on Capital but what kind of memes do so well it's the memes that don't yet have billions above billions of market cap it's the smaller tokens that do better for example here the ACT token went up by 2,000% in the last week we talked about this on this channel as well it's got a market cap of half a billion or here peanut now at 800 million went up by 677 peanut is currently at 88 cents per token and we got a buying alert for peanut when it was still at 3 cents so check this out Stan crypto bought peanut for 3 cents Crypt banter did the same that was on November 3rd how did we get those signals through tracking of crypto wallets so the blockchain is 100% transparent we can actually know what kind of wallet buys what and sells what at what point in time now the art in all of this is to find what influencer or what kind of Market maker owns what wallet once we have that knowledge of who owns what we can get signals and we did a lot of research we've got 33 wallets by Crypt banter alone in total we track more than 400 wallets here's the YouTube channel of Crypt benter they've got more than a million subscribers they defin defitely move markets and so I made an entire video course on just how to find wallets how to then afterwards track them and how to then subsequently interpret the signals from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com there are not just tutorials on wallet tracking there's also tutorials on onchain analytics on plotting relative valuation charts on portfolio Management on diversification Etc it's all up for your bench watching it's all up for your education and so when once we've got a signal we of course also discuss when to buy when to sell in dedicated groups in premium it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't make money or in case you don't like premium just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% there's zero risk for you I am not saying that Dogecoin has to crash tomorrow but what I am saying is that the risk to reward is not worth it the real rewards are in the smaller tokens and a I and meme coins are definitely now on the run if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I pr youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow

last week the chams meme coin on the binance smart chain outperformed most other meme coins now let's have a look at who's buying here who's actually pushing the price up let's see how much longer this really can last using onchain analytics now here's an overview of meme coins ordered by the performance in the last week teams had been the third best performing token just behind Nero on Eve and we've already made a video on Nero on this channel just recently chams is also a relatively large token on the binance smart chain it's it's got 3.1 million liquidity and since it's listing on coin market cap it went up by more than 240% now what's driving all of this we are not going to get the answer on the website it's simply just like any other meme coin we want to look at the data most people are not looking at now today we've got an overhang of roughly 300 buyers so that's 2,700 buyers versus 2,428 Sellers and the token is not just available decentralized it can also be bought on xt. comom which is affiliate to binance now on chain we've got 22,000 holders roughly on Twitter we've got roughly 40,000 followers so that's interesting double the number of followers on telegram we've only got 3,000 members so something is odd over here something seems to not really align normally those numbers are much closer to one another now let's try to figure out what's going on by looking onchain on the transactions on the binance smart chain we had the launch on the 28th of September and on the 5th of October we had a lot of new users so this chart here on the left shows a number of new users versus returning users we can also see on the exact same day how a lot of new buyers entered the token and so here's the 5th of October since all of those new buyers went in we saw the price appreciating by more than 135% now here's something very odd and I've never seen this for any other token ever and I've analyzed hundreds of tokens what we see over here is the number of small holders medium-sized holders and large holders the number of small holders have at current prices roughly $500 worth of the token in their wallet for the chart in the middle it's a 10x so that's $5,000 worth of the token on the right we've got $50,000 worth of the token now why is that so strange the beginning Spike here could be interpreted as an airdrop so that's okay but the holder development subsequently is very odd there was pretty much no accumulation by small retail whatsoever and now in the last 2 days it's growing somewhat okay that's understandable what's not understandable though is that the number of medium-sized wallets that have $5,000 worth of the token how this is going down that much it's also very strange that when we go at 10x in minimum holding how the number of wallets barely changes so there's around 13,000 wallets with $500 but there's around 12,000 wallets with $5,000 that does not make sense normally this number shrinks by at least 60 maybe 70% the chart on the right makes a bit more sense this is simply just accumulation by the Wales but still each of those wallets has $50,000 worth of the token while the liquidity pool only has 3 million so 100 such wallets is already more than there is liquid floating around in other words there's a lot of wallets with very large token Holdings that simply receiv the token and they never had to buy the token and it seems like the balances between those wallets is still shuffling around I do not believe that this is all organic I've never seen something like this normally we see the accumulation by small holders the most constant the left chart tends to usually rise the chart in the middle might go sideways but usually Also Rises and the chart on the right could go down when the price is going up as the whales take profit seeing such a disparity between the Holdings and seeing how there's almost as many wallets with $5,000 worth of the token compared to 500 all of this Rings The Alarm bells for me I don't dare to predict where the price is going maybe the whales are going to continue to push up this price potentially generating more attention potentially generating more buys by small retail that being said I do believe there's a lot of wash trading going on I do believe that this is not all organic adoption this is not hundreds and thousands of people getting excited about CHS this looks much more like a game of musical chairs of some people that have too much money to play with now I hope you can see how useful onchain and analytics are it's very nice to spot potential red flags that aren't visible in the price charts otherwise I'm using those analytics pretty much with any token that I buy and I also share that knowledge in premium so the link is down below it's that Bitcoin trade.com there's a link to our onchain analytics tools there's a video on how to use them there's a tool for the binance smart chain but also ethereum polygon avalange Etc and a separate tool for Solana as well there's also a dedicated video on how to build such tools and yeah by now we've got 100 of tutorial videos feel free to check it out in case you're interested in leveling up your crypto game and to not get always Rock pulled there's of course also a community where we discuss various altcoins that are dedicated chats in telegram so again if you want to level up your crypto game and if you enjoy memec coin trading then check it out the Bitcoin trade.com if you don't want to get that deep into the analytics there's also a free telegram this is where we have mainly small talk feel free to join there as well link is as well down below looking forward to seeing you there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh9fmmHtxcI,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum',

the site wave update for flare on this video I'm going to go over the larger term time frames as well as the smaller term time frames and I just want to discuss the two larger time frame patterns I'm expecting in the bullish scenario so in the bullish scenario we either have our bottom of our correction and start of our Trend at 1.2 now in this scenario we started in a correction and we ended as a running flat whatever the count was previous that didn't exist if you will so this is the start of our correction higher b-wave and we protected our a-wave so running flat so that's the bullish scenario in which case we'd start a trend from here to alltime highs uh looking for a large series of five wve move now in the less bullish scenario I hope we don't get this one this is either a correction as a wxy and we're just going to be chopping for years in a sideways Market or it's a diagonal and our bottom was over here in which case I wouldn't expect further upside than say 14 15 cents and this would make it larger Wave 1 and two but we're talking years down the road before that setup comes so obviously obviously still good upside we're talking you know 500% that's still obviously very good but obviously we prefer the start of the trend right here and this being a running flat so we're going to play this until it fails now before I get into the smaller time frames this is from last video we're looking for our third wave in white to complete and then another fourth in white and a fifth to the upside and then a four five in green so going to today's chart that was right here and you can see we got our 45 as a flat and our fifth wave to our Target now there's a couple counts here because this is a little bit difficult so right now have this labeled as 1 2 3 four working on four and then we look for a fifth wave for our third in blue which would create our 1 2 3 4 5 as you can see um but the deepness of this fourth wave is making me start to second guess the count so there are some Alternatives I'm going to show you but right now what I would expect this to turn into is either a triangle or a flat something like that before we get our fifth this is a pretty sharp correction and it looks corrective off this pivot so it would need to turn into something more complex as has a 4 five running flat or a triangle wave four um invalidation or sorry unlikely to be a fourth if we Dro below this 50% at 1. 1933 cents and inv validation of that at this Wave 1 overlap so this is my first count this is what I would like to see pan out but there is another count that would be like this the only difference is how you count this area is it as a expanded flat wave 1 or or sorry an expanded diagonal Wave 1 or is it a running flat with a sharp c-wave in this instance this is our one 2 3 4 five and we've completed the third wave in green coming to the extreme extension of the 3618 extension of wave 1 off of Wave 2 so in this case we'd want to hold above 1.89 2 cents same thing looking for flats or triangles and we'd only expect one more wave up before completing our larger one and two expecting a larger pullback so you can see the difference here and there is one more count unfortunately this is just the way it is sometimes and that is I'll do that in real time Discord member asked me for this that's why it's up here on YouTube today um just to give him Insight here the last scenario is a combination of both and I know it's frustrating not to have Clarity but it's kind of the way it is is sometimes and that is that this would become a very ugly diagonal wave 1 because all our FIB levels uh match up we just get an extreme wave one here this would be a double zigzag Wave 1 2 3 4 five so it would be like this one two uh that would be our running flat three four five like that so it's it's a little bit ugly right and we're in between both counts I'll show you those pivots too because they work as well as the other ones as you can see third wave hits our 1.618 standard extension for our wave three and our 200 our wave five comes between our 200 and 2.23 six so in this scenario if it is complete we'd expect a larger pullback and more time so this is my last alternative um so we'd pull our fibs from beginning of wave one off of the end of wave five like so we look for our wave two and most common areas for that is between the 50 and the 786 in validation at this low at 1.2 so this becomes my primary as soon as we drop below let me get rid of these that my ALT right now so we can get rid of that so as soon as we drop below these two counts 1 82 892 cents I assume that this one's in play our wave two and I'd be looking for Longs making this a larger one and two but anyways my bias is bullish just to be clear very bullish it's just are we complete a five-wave move do we need another four five it all depends what happens in this area and as you can see the difficulty of this region here can be counted many different ways which makes it a little bit difficult so me personally um if I was just holding spot I I would just continue to hold myself nothing to worry about there or if I were in trades I wouldn't want my stop past that 1.8 892 without considering a lower entry for our Wave 2 hopefully that's not too complicated but that's that's the help of Elliot wave and sometimes the frustration when you have multiple counts my job is just to track them and see which one is most likely based on the reaction so I hope this is helpful for those out there I know it's can be a little bit complicating but if we go back out to our daily sorry our 4our it does appear on the 4 Hour like we are in a fourth wave so perhaps we get that move higher this doesn't look like five waves but on the micro you can see the uh ability to be complete so we'll see what we get but I do hope that's our low and we're starting our in the larger degrees or one two three four way up there let's get way up there all right guys if you want to join the private Discord um there's a Link in the description cashing waves.com um that's where I put up a member video every morning it's half an hour to an hour

the last 24 hours the question is what's actually driving all of this is this potentially an opportunity to buy on a rally that might continue or are we looking at a pump and dump let's have a look at onch metrics most people aren't considering now here's what's going on the ACT token just recently got listed on binance and especially recently with the AI meme coin hype we now see that listings don't just result into 10 or 20% increases instead listings lead to massive massive relies especially for small market caps now coin gecko hasn't yet updated their overview we don't have binance there yet and so we already see how radium occupies a lot of the trading volume but gateio already listed before binance now here's a common misconception most people think that the all coins are currently rallying that we can simply buy 10 or 20 different altcoins and we are outperforming everything else that's not true though Bitcoin still tends to do better than most altcoins it's specifically the meme coins that do better than the rest because have a look at this this is the others dominance this shows how much of all of crypto is in the alt coins that are not in the top 10 and since beginning of the year this is actually going down from 13.4% to currently 99.4% the thing that's outperforming everything else is Bitcoin but within the altcoin market if you ignore gaming if you ignore defi there is one category that does better and that's the meme coins have a look at this this is coin gecko this is the categories Tab and at number one in the last seven days was the Elon Musk inspired meme coins but also the pump fun ecosystem is doing well dog themed tokens are doing well and here we go Act is part of the AI memes so on Solana Act is the third largest trending token it's only beaten by goat and frog and there's videos on both of those multiple videos actually on this channel feel free to check them out now to find out whether or not this really can continue conventional information sources such as the website are pretty much useless because everybody has access to the website this is not how we can get an edge in the market we need to look at data most people do not have access to or are too lazy to get the website is simply just a distraction if you're not in it for the money but you're in it for the entertainment then feel free to check it out but what really matters is are we facing manipulation here do the numbers for example in N let's have a look at the number of holders let's compare this to the number of followers on Twitter let's compare this to the number of followers on telegram is there a massive outlier whenever we see an outlier that's a red flag now on Solana we have 23,000 holders almost on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 13,000 followers and on telegram we've got 8,000 members of which 2,000 roughly are currently online so this all makes sense they are all the same kind of order of magnitude let's now dive deeper into the onchain analytics let's try to figure out what's actually happening with the buyers and sellers now here's a chart I look at for pretty much every video on this channel and that is the number of retail investors versus whale investors over time so instead of just counting every single holder right we've got 23,000 holders we want to differentiate this by minimum holding thresholds to actually get an idea what are the people doing that actually have not just a few cents in the market that aren't just Arbitrage spots but what are the actual investors doing so on the left side we've got the number of retail investors those are the number of wallets that have at least 2,000 act tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token in the middle we've got the mediumsized holders with at least 20,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we got another 10x in minimum holding so that's now $100,000 worth of the token now what do we see here we see clearly how all of those balances go down how's this possible when the price is going up the only explanation I have is that those are transfers to binance right so the people that take advantage of the Ry that want to sell they might not sell directly now anymore on the Solana chain they might sell on binance because there's more liquidity there there's less slip it especially when you've got a lot of the token selling on the most liquid places is very very important and so here's a very interesting effect with the binance listing the Wales bought up pretty much all of the token Supply so this is now on the left side the token balance based on different holding thresholds again small retail don't have a lot of the supply anymore medium retail and large retail also reduced their supply all the supply now went to the very largest wallets and of course one of those wallets at least is a binance wallet and so now it's really the Wales and it's binance that dictate the future price development they've got pretty much all of the supply what we can also see is that the listing directly impacted the number of new holders so the price rally did attract new investors there's now roughly 30% more small retail wallets 100% more medium-sized retail so they bought more and three to four times more large retail wallets of course the Wales also very very quickly bought up now how is it possible that the largest wallets are buying the fastest very often those kinds of listings get traded in an automatic manner so what happens is that some people have trading Bots that query the AP ey of binance regularly and when suddenly the API call returns another trading option that then when automatically a bot buys the token up on Solana with those kind of approaches the professional investors can of course make much more money they can be much earlier than small retail and this is in the end how over the long term the money flows from the not so skilled people to the more skilled people so I always like to watch at what are the whales doing what are the Insiders doing what are the people doing that historically made a lot of money because those people tend to make the better calls in the end crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the more the game is played the more over time the capital moves from The Not So skilled people to the more skilled people so when the people that have a lot of capital do something it's worth watching now does it still make sense to buy act on the one side we've got of course a lot of influence Now by binance and nobody knows what the market makers at binance do on the other side though we do see how small retail is buying the number of new investors is growing and not all of those investors might be directly on chain but just have a look at how many firsttime Traders there were yesterday it was three times more firsttime Traders then recurring Traders on a single day this is good this shows investor interest we can ignore the recent data point over here because today has just started I do expect that also today we will see more first-time Traders than recurring Traders now the art behind all of this is of course to learn about act before it's listed on binance and when we insiders and when we know people in the binance team of course we can make money but we can also make money by just knowing other insiders by tracking other insiders by tracking people that tend to buy early that make all the money by tracking influencers for example and that's what I personally do just have a look at this we see purchases by crypto banter and that was on the 19th of October of this year when Act was still at 3.7 cents again now it's at 55 cents Crypt Benta has more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube so they do move the market and we are tracking 33 of their wallets in total we track more than 400 wallets that's all part of Premium that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com and so it's always nice to see when new joiners make money directly from the beginning for example over here Bernard I always sent a new welcome message to new joiners and he wrote me that he's already seeing the value of this group and that the price is Justified now I strongly believe in wallet tracking I strongly believe that when we follow the people that have more knowledge than us then we can simply just get very similar performance to them and that's why there is an entire course eight videos in total just on how to find influencer wallets how to track those wallets and how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from those wallets besides those eight videos there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total in premium also on onchain analytics the data we looked at today also on things like portfolio diversification and risk management once we've got a signal we also need to discuss when to buy and when to sell so there are dedicated chats for the individual altcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently 125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% there's zero risk for you and so yes I do believe that act can go higher I do think so that volatility is likely going to increase because with increased volatility binance will make more fees if you got some value out this video here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regly like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or

Cryptocurrency, Popcat Analysis, Popcat Review, Popcat Price, Popcat Price Prediction, Popcat longterm, Popcat Tokenomics,   #popcat #memecoin #crypto","we are back into memec coin season and popcat is up almost 50% this week let's have a look at some onchain data let's have a look at who's driving this rally who's buying here who's selling here and how much longer could this rally potentially last so we currently at 73 C we gained 46% this week and the volatility in popcat is massive we've seen multiple crashes of 60 and 70% now let's have a look at who's actually Trading popcat so those are onchain metrics directly taken from the Solana chain and we are splitting up the trading volume by different cohorts so small retail is all wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of popcat for medium retail we go a 10x from that so that's $1,000 to $110,000 large retail is$ 10,000 to 100,000 and whale is everything above $100,000 worth of popcat now let's just have a look at the largest of the Traders the whales and the L retail the fraction of wallets that impact the price over time that are very large in size so at least $10,000 worth of the token that tends to increase over time it used to be somewhere around the 5% Mark now it's rather around 20% now instead of normalizing the trading volume to 100% we can also look at this measured in US Dollars that's this chart over here there's an interesting Turning Point at around end of February of this year so we had two major spikes of attention one during Christmas of last year and one in the middle of January of this year and then it got rather silent but something happened since the end of February of this year trading volume stays elevated now what happened at the time centralized exchange listings happened so now it's not just trading on chain it's also the gate iOS bances Maxis and Q coins of this world that allow trading of popcat and they obviously hold their own Market making stake as well they don't just hold tokens in the name of the customers and so let's have a look at the relative valuation so this is now popcat relative to s o to the Solana token and why do we look at the relative valuation and not just at the US dollar chart it's because I want to see outperformance if we take on more Risk by buying a mem coin rather than just the ecosystem token then we want to get more returns for popcat the additional risk was properly compensated it outperformed s so by almost 3,000% and so the first vertical line is when centralized exchanges started adopting popcat and this was also the start of a continued outperformance of the token the second vertical line is when I last time made a video on popcat interestingly enough the video underperformed it didn't get that many views the title was popcat is too high and subsequently popcat did underperform by 45% at the time there wasn't a lot of new money flowing into the token and it looked like the centralized exchanges were manipulating the price to a degree we are going to look at very similar metrics in this video as well in a second because I believe there are two major drivers for meme coin prices the first one is simply adoption by a lot of retail investors that tend to push up the price the second driver and that's not too small either is manipulation by the centralized exchanges when centralized exchangers own a lot of the token they might sometimes manipulate the price temporarily shortterm to the upside or to the downside that's why I like to look at onchain metrics to see how many people are actually behind a certain Rally or behind a certain crash this is how we were able to find out that at least temporarily the price was somewhat elevated currently just looking at the relative valuation a very simplistic approach but we're going to look at the data in a second the potential risk versus so is 28% roughly the potential reward may be 886 but yeah I do publish videos on popcat regularly on this channel so if you don't want to miss the next video feel free to subscribe but let's look into the data what we see over here is different kinds of holders we are segregating by three different types on the left we've got small retail so that's the number of wallets over time that have at least 1,000 popcat tokens at the current price that's $732 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's a minimum holding of $7,000 on the right we've got the large Wales that's a minimum holding of $770,000 worth of the token isn't it interesting how the number of retail investors tends to grow over time and how the number of medium-sized retail tended to stop growing in the last 6 months and how the number of whale wallets is completely flat since beginning of the year even though more and more trading volume is dominated by the larger wallets the net holding does not necessarily increase and so pretty much much all of the price appreciation we have seen in the last months is solely due to retail this 600% outperformance versus Solana seems to be driven by the number of retail wallets growing roughly 50% but again those are just the onchain metrics right we don't know what happens inside the centralized exchanges those are black boxes so right now at least idiosyncratically the trend in popcat seems to be healthy in other words I do believe popcat has a good chance to continue to outperform so that being said Solana itself is already very high and the air might be getting thin for the US dollar variation of Solana this is the Solana dominance over time Solana is currently 3.2% of all of crypto in terms of market cap and we haven't gotten Beyond this for the last 9 months if things turn sour then the potential downside versus the rest of crypto could be 84% so any outperformance of a Solana meme coin has has to come from the meme coin adoption it's not going to come just from the so US dollar price going up at least relative to bitcoin and relative to ethereum the Solana dominance is already pretty high and so what is gaining dominance it's for example Bitcoin people get more and more afraid people get more and more risk off and the same can be seen in the stable coin dominance so the fraction of crypto that's in stable coins tends to increase since March of this year it used to be at 5.1% now it's at 7.8 8% since March April of this year we don't see the market cap of stable coins growing anymore so there's no new money flowing into crypto from the Fiat system inflows equal outflows so this is now 100% a player versus player game now this YouTube channel has a premium membership and in premium We are following various other influencers so we trying to find the wallets of other influencers we're tracking those wallets and we get notifications whenever other influencers buy and this can be useful because it gives us a potential hint before a cryptocurrency gets promoted so for example we see over here how Kyle Chessie is dollar cost averaging into popcat since August 8th of this year so every now and then $3,000 worth of popcat is been bought this is the influencer We are following we by the way following more than 200 wallets and he bought when the price was at 64 cents or 53 currently we are at 73 cents and so there's two parts to this game the first game is finding the wallet right trying to figure out what wallet belongs to what influencer the second part is trying to find out what kind of signals are actually useful there are tutorials in premium on both topics how to find influencer wallets via nfts or via the current Holdings or transaction amounts or via related transactions with dbank frch Arkham there's all kinds of approaches we are looking at centralized exchange deposit wallets we looking at related wallets and we then set up alerts with telegram Bots like ether drops Aram cello Etc the last and longest video is how to interpret those alerts so if this is something for you feel free to

high now the issue is that there is a strong correlation between attention on a cryptocurrency and its price in other words when a cryptocurrency is low nobody is looking when a cryptocurrency is high everybody is looking so people end up buying high and selling low in this video I want to talk about a cryptocurrency that's pretty much out of the eyesight of most people because it did not perform that well in the last year but I think not necessarily justifi ibly so so this was the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the last year pretty much everything was green but there are a few outliers and one of them being over here so in the last year ethereum went up by more than 60% Bitcoin went up by more than 120% but have a look at this this is polygon metic polygon metic lost in an over bullish Trend 27% now here's the big question is this price drop Justified is polygon metic dying is there still adoption is there a lot of token inflation what's going on here so let's address token inflation first this is the circulating supply of polygon metic over time and yes this Rose quite a bit a 5x in the circulating Supply within roughly 5 years but looking forward there is no more circulating Supply expansion we have hit pretty much 100% of circulating supply for polygon metic and what that means is that there's no more tokens hitting the the market that could then potentially depress the price right that's the idea as Supply grows but demand doesn't grow as quickly then the price gets supressed however if there is no more growth in supply and demand can somewhat grow then of course the price can appreciate as well so let's now look at the demand the supply side is no problem there's no more token inflation according to defi Lama polygon metic is the 11th largest blockchain at least in terms of total value locked according to coin market cap it's the 18th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap here's the total value locked development on chain on polygon Matic in US Dollars of course we had a massive defi summer we spiked all the way to almost 10 billion now we came back down now we are at a bit over 900 million and we've been there for quite a while for more than a year measured in meic tokens this chart doesn't look that different so measured in meic tokens we actually went up slightly in the last year so there's more total value locked on chain while again the price went down by 27% so maybe there is some kind of Disconnect here but let's s deeper let's have a look at the usage of the polygon metic chain so not the total value locked but simply the number of transactions the number of wallets how much is polygon metic actually being used and is this potentially declining explaining this price depression on defi Lama we've got different blockchains ordered by its activity in the last 24 hours and at number one is actually Solana at number six already we've got polygon metic and here's the interesting thing about polygon metic when we look at the major coins ordered by liquidity we don't just have meme coins like on Solana or on Bas we've got the sandbox token we've got the render token we've got cadal another liquidity pool for the decentralized exchange quick swap so it's not all just meme coin gambling here compare this with the top tokens on Solana we've got slur book of meme cats in a darkg world Etc I don't have to tell you more now let's have a look at the number of addresses and the number of transactions that can be found over here so this is a June dashboard it looks at the number of transactions since beginning of the year it's relatively constant the number of active addresses also relatively constant recently there had been a lot of new contracts deployed that's very interesting I do not know what's driving this massive search in contract deployments and the address activity tends to even be rising isn't that fascinating that's a lot of information on this dashboard the daily fees are somewhat fluctuating but it all seems to be somewhat stable it doesn't look like a dying chain whatsoever look at this the polygon gas fees they even tend to be rising now let's have a look at relative valuations probably we are now relatively speaking cheap right because polygon Matic underperformed while the rest of the market went up but is there potentially a support so when we look at relative valuations of polygon meic say to ethereum or say to bitcoin or say to to BNB right a very strong competitor how does that currently look like this is the Matic US dollar price and we are going sideways pretty much since March of 2021 but a lot of that sidewards movement was also due to a circulating Supply expansion right the circulating Supply isn't expanding anymore going forward according to this metric we are neither very cheap nor very expensive we're pretty much in the middle but here's the thing right we always want to look at relative performance because the reason why we get into polygon metic over just Bitcoin or ethereum is because we want to get outsized performance we take on more risk because we want to get more performance why else take on something that's not as safe as Bitcoin for example let's have a look at meic relative to bitcoin that's the chart the potential risk here is maybe an additional underperformance of 35% the potential reward though if things go really well is an outperformance of more than 400% I'm not saying that this will happen but this is the idea of buying low and selling high right we have to take some kind of a calculated risk this is polygon metic relative to ethereum this looks very very nice very little risk so it's possible to even set a somewhat close stop loss maybe for an underperformance of say up to 20% or so but the potential outperformance ranges all the way up to almost plus 300% here polygon metic relative to B andb also very little downside but nice upside in the best of cases more than 300% and so this is how I see this what's the risk that we take on here normally for most altcoins time is against us and that's because more more competition enters the space but also because there's all of that token inflation we don't have the token inflation anymore of course we've got more and more layer ones and layer twos that get set up that can potentially compete with polygon Matic but still metic is a very large chain it's not necessarily going down in usage and it doesn't have any more token inflation and obviously we have to buy before we know what's the next narrative that can push this up right if you bought Solana low you could not anticipate that it's going to be meme coin trading that's going to push that up we don't know what will happen with maic will it be defi that accelerates the next rally will it be meme coin trading as well will it just move from base and from Solana to meic I have no idea I don't dare to anticipate that but what I do dare to anticipate is that a lot of the cell pressure has already been realized and that right now rative valuations look pretty clean thus I'm also planning to buy some meic tokens after this video I haven't bought anything yet I'm always buying just after the video several hours after publishing a video and I'm only going to exit that position in case crypto turns really really bearish I will also hedge myself against the general marro Trend so I will go short ethereum at the same time so I will basically bet on the relative valuation right I will bet on meic relative to ethereum going up not relative to the US dollar so I'm not so certain that this chart here will go up but this chart looks pretty promising to go up so I will deposit stable coins on a borrowing and lending platform like a I will borrow ethereum against this have then an ethereum denominated loan swap that against metic then wait for this to go up to then afterwards swap it back to ethereum pay off the loan and make profit for this relative valuation play if this went a bit over your head how to set this up right how to buy metic versus ethereum and not metic in US Dollars then feel free to

let's have a look whether or not it makes sense to buy this Bottom now because in the end it's a game of buying low and selling high and obviously right now the wif token is relatively low now in this video in order to answer this question we are going to look at onchain data we are going to look at data most people are not considering we are not just drawing random lines on charts we're actually looking at what are the whales doing what is retail doing how's the market in general developing right now so here a quick refresher dog with head is currently at $184 and had temporarily a market cap of almost 5 billion now we are below 2 billion we've seen nothing but declining prices since the end of March and is there maybe a bottom forming here now why should we look at do with head in the first place of course because it's one of the major meme coins across all Chains It's at number four in terms of market cap still Dogecoin is more than eight times the size on the Solana chain when ordering by liquidity pool size do with head is the fourth largest token so still a lot of trading happens directly on chain this is not just trading on centralized exchanges now the price action of dog with head has to be seen in the General market environment right when all of crypto is going up then do with f is going up as well with leverage and vice versa so the problem is unfortunately that all of crypto isn't doing too well and we can see this very nicely across chains looking at the total value locked so check this out this column over here this is the one month change in total value locked for various chains Solana is the fourth largest chain and it saw its total value lock decreasing by 11% in the last month there's pretty much only red over here the only chain that has positive momentum at the moment is the ton chain so the VL for Solana dropped by 11% in 1 month dog with head though dropped by 44% in 1 month so yes there is inherent leverage in altcoins but 44% versus 11% that's quite a difference is there maybe something going on that most people are not aware of I believe there is something let's have a look at the number of whale investors on chain so I've built a tool to count the number of wallets based on a minimum holding threshold and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 500 dog with hatch tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail so long-term retail tends to be accumulating and rarely sells in aggregate in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now 5,000 tokens or almost $10,000 here we've seen a lot of accumulation in December of last year and since then the holding isn't really changing much for those medium-sized holders of course December of last year was still a very nice time to get into the token now on the right side we see the big problem this is the wallets that matter by far the most this is the whale wallets this is the wallets that have at least 50,000 tokens so the Wallets on the right are 100 times more important than the Wallets on the left and so the accumulation here really doesn't matter that much when the number of whales gets cut by 25% rough in the last 6 months the whales continue to take profit they continue to sell off and that's the reason why the price is having such a hard time when the overal market is not expanding I believe the underperformance of dog with head in the last month is due to the Wales selling off and it doesn't look like they're stopping it looks like this is a very constant bleed and there's still a lot of those wallets left now why is the market in egot doing so poorly I believe it's because no more fiat currency is flowing in here are some major stable coins added together the market cap of D usdt usdc of B USD when we add all of those together we can see that since end of April of this year there's actually no more stable coin printing going on so in agregate there are not more people depositing their Fiat on centralized exchanges that then send it over to say tether that then print the token compared to people that cash out so we are now clearly in a player play versus player Market before we had an expanding market and so it was existing players versus new players now it's existing player versus existing player it's much harder to make money this way and when no more money is flowing in since April of this year and dog with hat has a hard time expanding in market cap as well also since April of this year by the way now let's have a look at that chart historically again the stablecoin market caps and when they increase we tend to be in a bull market when we go sideways then the alt coins already tend to bleed when we are going down then of course everything is going down including Bitcoin and ethereum this here this big crash was the teral Luna collapse this is when the anchor protocol went belly up then we actually don't have that much more time but I don't actually believe that we're going to see simply just the same development again but still this is not good for altcoins especially for the risky altcoins where the whales tend to sell on top of that we've also got more and more manipulation going on unfortun Ely some trading volume happens on binance as well so that's 27% of all of trading volume we've also got levered bets on the price now Perpetual Futures they are used quite a bit as well almost 1 billion of trading volume in the last 24 hours so you can hear from the tone of this video that I'm not necessarily a fan of buying dog with head I used to cover the wif token very early on this channel when there was still a rising price and at that time things looked okay now now unfortunately we have this double wemy here right we've got the selling by the Wales and we've got General crypto not expanding I personally approach this Market a bit differently now instead of trying to find the one or two alt coins that might outperform I'm simply betting on falling prices when most altcoins underperform why not just bet on most altcoins doing worse this is one of those altcoins that I'm shorting I'm making very consistent gains with this since beginning of the year we went down by almost 60% and yes there is a little bit volatility but it's really not that noteworthy compared to other charts right when you can make money when this continues to go down then why not bet on this why try to pick this one needle in the hze deck right it makes no sense I've talked about how to short assets like this how to find assets like this in the premium membership so that's down below that's the Bitcoin tray.com there's a 42 minute tutorial video and of course in premium I also discuss what assets make sense to Short and of course I also reveal what this asset here is so if you've got roughly $3,000 or so to put on this bet you should get premium for free right this is the kind of magnitude you have to be dealing with if your crypto portfolio is just a few hundred then it makes no sense but if you've got 7,000 in crypto and you can put 3,000 on this bet you should get premium for free there's no guarantee in anything in investing but at least that's what I personally do right I bet on this continuing to fall I will continue to make updates on various mem coins on this channel incl including

buying here who's selling here who's driving the price this is the rally I'm talking about we are almost at 70 cents now and the price of colum is rather erratic right we see these random spikes then subsequent crashes now we are in a spike again does this mean that we are going to crash what's causing this now I'm not going to present you the content and the marketing on the website this is not how we can get Alpha how we can get a knowledge Edge over the rest of the market instead let's check out the things most people aren't looking at here's the white paper the final version of the white paper but have a look at this that final version was published in November of 2016 does this mean that Golem is actually a dead project and this is simply just a pump and dump some kind of manipulation let's dive deeper what we've got over here is the GitHub repository of golum so this is the place where programmers submit their code changes and no this is not a dead project there was an update 14 hours ago another one 19 hours ago yesterday 2 days ago 2 days ago so there's still something actively Happening Here the team is still working on this dpin project on the project of distributed GPU power but let's have a look at what's driving here demand and Supply let's have a look at toomics let's have a look at adoption metrics what we've got over here is the active address count for golum a lot of ction in 2017 then a subsequent crash now it's pretty much at zero here's a transaction volume over time very much the same picture social metrics aren't too impressive either the number of Reddit subscribers is rather shrinking but here's a rather positive chart it's just a horizontal line this shows us the circulating Supply so at least there isn't any expanding Supply anymore potentially depressing the price this is the problem with most altcoins most altcoins issue a lot of tokens to the early investors and to the the team that then sells off that then depresses the price this seems to not be the case anymore for golum now there are two versions of the token one of them is on ethereum and that token has 19,6 45 holders there's another version of the token this one has 12,000 holders so it seems like the capital locked up in ethereum and in polygon doesn't seem to be that different but actually once we dive deeper it is very very different I've built a tool to distinguish the retail investors from the whale investors you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool you can pluck in any polygon token in this tool and we can look at what are the people doing access to this tool is available for the premium members together with a tutorial video so that's down below the bitcoin.com feel free to check it out and it shows on the left side the number of Wallets on ethereum that hold at least 2,000 tokens at the current price that's a bit over $11,000 that's what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now $10,000 worth of of the token on the right side we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token now those are very long-term charts let's have a look at the same thing just for the last month that's over here and we see actually quite a bit of accumulation by the whales the number of wh wallets grew by more than 20% maybe 25% medium-sized retail grew to a similar degree small retail grew a bit less and that then explains a price development like this at least to a degree there is something that I don't like here but before we get into that let's first look at the polygon based token right there's the ethereum based token and the polygon based token and remember how the number of total holders was a bit over half for polygon versus e now here are the same charts with the same thresholds for polygon much much less more than 3,000 holders with 2,000 tokens on ethereum only 20 such holders on polygon the same difference can be seen obviously for mediumsized retail and for the whales so for whatever reason there are a lot of wallets of this token on polygon but they all have minuscule amounts of it I don't know why that is but it is something very distinct I've never seen this relationship mismatch that massively now let me show you the thing that I do not like so much about this rally it's nice that we do see some accumulation on ethereum and it's also nice that we see this across the board both with the retail people buying but also with the Wes buying and with the Wes potentially buying even more that being said the price movements tend to be accelerate now and that acceler duration might not be natural because again the holder numbers grew by 20 to 25% the price grew by 220% in the same time period and the answer to this puzzle might be over here this is the Perpetual Futures Trading volume so that's the levered bets on the price and there is a ton of trading volume on binance there's xt. comom and binance XT is simply just a Rebrand of binance this is more than a billion dollars worth of trading volume in the last 24 hours alone and that's for a market cap of 650 million so that's not yet two or three times the market cap that's being traded that would be clear manipulation but it's definitely elevated there is some hot air in this rally as well so does it make sense to hold colum potentially maybe with a trailing stop loss in case we do see a deflation temporarily we do see accumulation that's good but we also see involvement by centralized exchanges which I don't like that much if it's your first time here feel free to

metic token keeps crashing why is that why is there no flaw who's actually selling here let's have a look at some onchain data let's have a look at some relative variations and see whether or not this is a falling knife or a potential opportunity now I've made a video on metic or the P token roughly 1 month ago and what's interesting about this video is that it outperformed the average video so the average video is here in Gray in blue is the polygon Matic video and that happened even though that was a very bearish video and bearish videos tend to do not that well on YouTube right most people want to get their buyers confirmed they tend to give thumbs down when they own an asset and they see something critical however even though that video was critical it's still outperformed now Matic is a layer 2 scaling Solution on top of the ethereum blockchain there now many l2s and so it makes sense to compare the meic price with the ethereum price meic was one of the first of its kind and so in initially it did very well but now the competition increased now there's optimism now there's arbitrum and recently also the base chain and so now we see an underperformance of 87% in the span of only the last 1 and 1/2 years the picture doesn't look that different for Matic relative to bitcoin also here historically we are at an all-time low we have underperformed Bitcoin since launch by 45% now meic is in a tricky situation it's now in a market segment that has very little adoption crypto is now splitting into two directions on the one hand we've got the long-term Bitcoin investors that simply regard Bitcoin as the safest of the monies at the hardest of the monies and that might allocate to bitcoin through the ETF on the other hand we've got the people that actively trade that want to get 10x 100x returns and so everything that's not extremely high risk or that's not Bitcoin that tends to now shrink what we've got over here is the others dominance so this is a measure of how much of all of cryptocurrency's market cap is in the altcoins that is not in the top 10 and yes this is fluctuating to a degree but since beginning of the year the field in the middle tended to do pretty poorly minus 33% again that's relative to all the other cryptocurrencies and at the same time the importance of Bitcoin as a fraction of all of crypto continues to rise the Bitcoin dominance is going up this will not happen forever though I believe there might be again a turnaround at one point and that's when we hit the 70% Mark roughly because in the past that's exactly what we have seen whenever Bitcoin was at around 70% of all of cryptocurrency's market cap we have seen very quickly that dominance crashing now when Bitcoin dominance crashes this is simply another sign for the altcoins in aggregate outperforming right now Bitcoin is outperforming most but depending on how quickly this appreciation continues maybe in 6 months maybe in 12 months we will be at a heated stage again where the alt coins including potentially polygon metic could outperform again now we all know the source of that outperformance it's Wall Street money it's money flowing in through the ETFs so that's very positive almost every single day and that's because the grayscale Bitcoin trust isn't selling anymore now only the new instruments see inflows and that's of course supported by the Trump Administration Trump is pro crypto and so Wall Street feels more comfortable allocating to Bitcoin now there is a potential Catalyst for Matic and that is ethereum I was bearish on ethereum for a very very long time but now we could see a potential turnaround and again the reason for this is the ETF ethereum has an ETF as well and that was pretty dormant up until recently in the last 5 days we've seen a lot of inflows and if you annualize the last 7 days we already get at a 7.1% supply absorption so that refers to all of the ethereum supply 7% of it would be absorbed by the ETF if those inflows were to continue now since the merge from proof of work to proof of stake for ethereum if had a very bad time against Bitcoin it went down by 59% but if now ethereum can turn around through those ETF inflows by extension metic might also go up because it could be seen as a levered version on ethereum because it's a layer two now how did we find ourselves in that mess the answer is of course the update of the tokenomics after the move from the meic token to the P token the metic supply was supposed to be kept now it's not anymore after that merge now we see inflation and that's especially problematic when the usage on polygon isn't really that high only $182 Million worth of tokens got traded on polygon in the last 24 hours compare this with Solana that's close to 7 billion now don't get me wrong I'm not a Perma Crypt bear I'm not bearish on crypto as a whole I simply just think that the market is now splitting up we actually see how crypto is currently expanding in we do see how money is Flowing from traditional Finance into crypto have a look at this this is the stable coin market cap over time and this goes up whenever you sent your hard-earned US dollars to a centralized exchange and that centralized exchange might then send this over to tether and tether then creates tokens and this goes down whenever you withdraw right whenever you want to pull your Fiat out and so this crash over here was the Tera Luna collapse this is when USD went Belly Up it started the bare Market it started the contraction and through that contraction also FTX collapsed and then it turned around at the beginning of October of this year and it's now accelerating again but here's the thing crypto is all about risk versus reward and we all know how crypto is very risky thus the upside potential needs to be there and so even though Solana for example is used a lot now I don't necessarily think that it's that great of an investment either because check out the Solana dominance it seems to be peing so I'm not saying that the Solana dominance has to go down I'm simply saying that it might just keep Pace with Bitcoin you might not get this additional risk compensated the market seems to have understood this concept because otherwise how is it possible that the top performing categories within crypto are now the meme coins it's a tokens that can 10x it's the tokens that can 100x the entire pump fun ecosystem so the launch pad of meme coins on Solana went up by 130% in the last 7 days what else went up Elon Musk inspired memes base memes dog themed memes AI memes frog themes it's all memes and we can even drill a bit deeper right what within the meme coin Market performed best it's the tokens with most upside potential so have a look at this in the last 24 hours what performed the best it's market cap 19 million 31 million 128 million Etc it's in the few Millions it's not in the few billions and so really the art of the game is to either simply have exposure to the asset that tends to appreciate most against the rest or alternatively to be very active in trading the things where all the attention is now headed we already know that with an altcoin we can easily lose 90% if that's the case why not buy something that can also 10 x and so here's what performed the best in the last week it's again the pump fun ecosystem and the token that made 1700% in the last week is now at 1.7 billion but one week ago it was at 100 million it's currently at $183 and the first video about that token about the peanut meme coin was published here when it was still at 11 cents and so I got a lot of questions in the last weeks right why do I make so many videos on Meme coins again I believe that's where most of the growth is it doesn't matter whether or not we like it we simply just have to face reality people either just allocate or they actively trade everything in the middle gets crushed and so why not be part of the party while it lasts by the way Peanut is up since that video by 1,500% roughly now to Outsiders this might all seem like random gambling right we buy a meme token that has no intrinsic value and we hope for it to go up why should we do this the answer is those kinds of performances are not random crypto is both a game of luck but also of skill and so when we've got some analytics that most people do not have when we've got information that most people don't have then we can buy better than others we can sell better than others we need to know something that most people don't and so here is my personal approach to this I like to track other people that influence markets and that tended to do the right calls in the past so have a look at this we got an alert that Crypt bent bought the peanut token at 3 cents so that was over here since then the price went up by 6,000 per. now who is Crypt banter Crypt banter is one of the largest crypto channels in YouTube they've got 1.1 million subscribers when they talk about a token the token goes up through onchain analytics we found 33 of their wallets and we track those wallets we get alerts whenever those wallets buy or sell something I have a look at this this is Alex Becker he's got 1.48 million subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets and so it's all about following the smart money it's all about replicating the people that make money in crypto it's not about random gambling it's not about picking random tokens with funny names on a list and so I believe that much in the strategy that I built a dedicated cost just on wallet tracking how can we find wallets by influencers how can we subsequently track them and how can we finally interpret the signals that we get from the trkking it's eight videos in total it's part of the premium membership but premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's about portfolio diversification it's about back testing there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in premium once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss it we have to figure out when to buy when to sell we have to look at the different onchain analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins in premium as well and so I believe it's important to be part of either segment simply just dollar cost average into Bitcoin or get into active trading if you do want to do the active trading don't just do it randomly do it with a group that does proper analytics it's currently $125 per month there is a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you yes there is a slight chance that the meic token might go up in case ethereum gets supported through the ETF I think the best chances though are when Bitcoin dominance is at 70% and most alt coins outperform Bitcoin at that point before that I simply just bet on the very small meme coins I believe this is where most of the upside is if you got some value video feel you to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see

come up with a project that defrauds the contractors that doesn't pay the programmers maybe you come up with a project that doesn't have real offices that only has fake letter box addresses maybe your story would also include how the project has lost a million doll Court battle fetch AI has all of it this guy probably had quite a few sleepless nights recently it's humanum founder of fetch Ai and the UK entity that holds the intellectual property is just facing an appointment of Administrators so one step before filing bankruptcy now let's have a look where this company is registered 18 latent Place bur Sun Edmunds yeah this definitely looks like the absolute techup where Cutting Edge AI is being developed here is the article everybody is talking about the UK entity had financial difficulties I will link the article down below the tldr is that fetch AI hasn't paid its contractors probably programmers but who knows it didn't pay out the promise $750,000 the contractor went to court and what is our genius CEO doing he's trying to shut down the business but now he couldn't so there's some shuffling around with entities happening again another fetch AI 2024 is being created so there's an entity in the UK there's an entity in Singapore there's another entity in Dubai at least very soon people aren't get getting paid entities get shut down and recreated again to avoid the obligations and so there's some comingling happening with assemble. aai and with a resolve advisory limited now this is not the first time I'm talking about fetch AI I made a video one year ago warning fetch AI is fake but this was mainly due to the technology not necessarily due to the company structure or the ethics of the team the video was quite successful it had way more reach than the average video I followed up with another video 9 month ago with a warning that fetch AI was pretty expensive relatively speaking to other cryptocurrencies and so here's the performance in the last year the token went down by 50% and then somewhat reverted in October again now where did this positive momentum come from I think it was due to the General market have a look at this this is the historical stable coin market cap so it's die tether usdc and B USD and there was declining since the teral Luna collapse since the anchor protocol broke down but this is now turning around since the beginning of October of last year we see an expansion in crypto again we see that Fiat money is flowing into crypto again and so all kinds of altcoins are doing very well now and fetch AI also profited from that rally here's the thing those profits aren't lasting very long this is the long-term chart simply fetch AI in US Dollars we do get our Ries in Bull markets but we also get our massive dumps in bare markets behind me is the relative valuation to ethereum you always want to look at relative valuation because crypto is highly correlated when ethereum goes up then the altcoins go up as well when ethereum goes down the altcoins crash this is fetch AI divided by ethereum and yes this does not look pretty we could easily go down relative to ethereum by 80% but let's have a look at the recent development with all of those rumors around a bankruptcy with fetch AI let's have a look at who's buying and who's selling here what is the Smart money doing what are the whales doing are they buying the dip are they selling what caused this crash in the last month from 77 cents to currently 52 cents here are some charts that answer that question this is a tool that I've developed myself and it's available to the premium members so that's the link down below the bitcoin.com this is where you can get access to this tool with a tutorial on how to use it on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 fetch AI tokens so at the current price that's $520 this is small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail we go on order of magnitude up so that's now $5,000 worth of the token per wallet and on the right side we've got the Wales that's at least $50,000 worth of the token Now isn't that interesting retail was still buying at the beginning of the month and then turned around the medium-sized holders and the whales though they are selling pretty constantly in that last month and yes not only retail gets spooked here the people that know a thing or two about crypto are also exiting will fetch ai go completely Bust from all of this will it go bankrupt I don't don't know I don't think so actually but I don't like the whole tone of this I don't like that the project had to go to court I don't like that they lost the court battle I don't like that they have to pay a million dollars to a contractor that has very likely rightfully performed the services I have the strong suspicion that there's something unethical going on there and so I simply just stay away I already don't like the technology feel free to check out prior videos on that now on top of that I also don't like the team if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciate as

Drift Review, Drift Price, Drift Price Prediction, Drift longterm, Drift Tokenomics,  #drift #crypto #altcoin","the drift protocol has a lot of things going for it the usage is increasing this is the total value locked on the Solana chain and that usage might even accelerate in the next one or two months let's have a look at The Good the Bad and the Ugly so here's one of the good things when we look at the total value lock not in US dollars but measured in Solana the growth is even more steady so all the fluctuation we can see on the US dollar chart is solely because crypto as a whole fluctuates but the adoption is pretty constant now a lot of that total value locked increase has to do with existing users so there aren't too many new users coming in at least for the Perpetual Futures product but the platform is very sticky many people that wants tried it continue to use it and so we see a pretty stable number of transactions over time we're seeing quite a few assets deposited this month and the Insurance Fund tends to grow with that now here's the bread and butter product of drift protocol it's a decentralized Perpetual Futures Trading platform on Solana so if you feel like gambling you can bet with 20x on Solana on bitcoin or on ethereum and even on some more exotic cryptocurrencies we've got even meme coins in here popcat Etc but the pital Futures is actually not what's interesting here at first glance the token looks super boring since it's airdrop in May of this year we simply just went sideways now we are at 49 but here's the kicker the focus of drift becomes now its new betting platform so check this out this is their Twitter bet on drift it's got 111,000 followers and here's the product the BET product on drift with a 52% chance that Donald Trump will win the election there is $3 million on that bet there's another 21 million on whether or not Camila Harris will win the popular vote so we've got five political bet open right now Formula 1 betting is going to come and since the presidential election will be on the 5th of November this is where I believe a lot of adoption for drift can accelerate and that might lead us to Breaking finally the sidewards trading range now one has to wonder why did the price go sideways while at the same time the usage of the platform is growing I believe the reason for that price under performance relatively speaking is twofold first of all we had a lot of receivers of the air drop that simply sold that governance token secondly the supply of drift tends to grow over time let's have a look at both let's start off with the toomics there's 53% going to the community and ecosystem and 10% of that was the airdrop launch now it's not worry that 43% goes to trading rewards so if you're using the platform you earn drift tokens that you might sell so that's constant sell pressure but there's also 25% for product protocol development and 22% for strategic participants so those are not necessarily pretty tokenomics now let's have a look at how this unlocks over time we are now at month 4 to 5 after launch we are currently over here and one year from now the supply will more than double again that's not pretty and so I'm not sure how well drift can do after the presidential election I believe that there will be a lot of demand during the election but long term things are a bit questionable now let's have a look at whether or not there still pressure from the airdrop we've got the data here this comes from a tool that I've developed myself that's available to the premium members so you can plug in any Solana token into that tool and get similar kinds of data and I believe this is very useful this counts the number of wallets with minimum holding thresholds so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 drift tokens so at the current price that's $489 for the middle chart we go a 10x from that so that's now a minimum holding of $5,000 for the right we look at the Wales that's a minimum holding of $50,000 now the whales didn't sell at all they rather accumulated medium-sized retail and small retail did sell but it looks like the selling has somewhat slowed down it appears that in the last 3 weeks there was no net selling anymore and so that's then also where the price was able to recover quite a bit and so does it make sense to buy drift now to then potentially sell close to the presidential election I believe this could be a play that might pay off but there are two carats nothing in crypto is safe the first one is potential manipulation by the centralized exchanges because yes the drift protocol can be traded across various Cs and there are even Perpetual Futures on the token which by the way aren't used that much right now so currently the price doesn't seem to be too manipulated but it's definitely a possibility in the future the second caveat is unfortunately again that trading range because we can have a look at this in a bit more detail instead of looking at the US dollar chart we now look at the relative variation to Solana and that shows us a range from bottom to top of roughly 100% or the other way around ofus 50% and unfortunately we are pretty high on that range and so psychologically some people might take profit over here but still looking at the number of retail investors it seems like not too many people are exiting just yet and so I believe the drift token is a nice short-term bet up until the presidential election what happens afterwards is of course in the Stars will the platform still be used enough with the Formula 1 product will the bad toomics take over nobody knows but at least for now things seem to be aligned quite nicely the rails are buying small retail stopped selling and drift is heavily betting on additional usage due to this event I personally will buy some drift after releasing of this video several hours afterwards I never buy a token

Price, Bonk Price Prediction, Bonk longterm, Bonk Tokenomics,  #bonk #memecoin #crypto","the Bonk meme coin on Solana is yet on another run let's have a look at onchain data and find out who is buying who is selling here is this adoption by a lot of people pushing up the price sustainably or is this manipulation by the large Wales let's look deeper into the data most people aren't considering so this is the price action today we are up 133% this week we are up 20% and this month we almost doubled we are very close to the alltime high this is not the first video on Bon on this channel I published a video half a year ago the video performed better than average so the average video is here in Gray and in blue we see that first video's performance at the time we were at a price of 5 Z 4383 so that was on the 20th of November of last year so over here on this chart since then of course we made a multiple X so if this is your first time looking at Bon then maybe consider following channels like this I try to be early I try to publish videos regularly now let's have a look at this recent price r let's say the last month and let's also look at what could potential head wins be how much more can Bon potentially rise so here's some onchain data from a tool that I've developed myself you can check out this tool in the premium membership link is down below the bitcoin.com you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and what we see over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on any given day and whenever we see a spike of firsttime Traders coming into any token we tend to see quite a bit of price appreci iation afterwards the reason for that is that the number of investors is growing for a token as long as more people jump on a token the price of course tends to rise so let's have a look at the 24th of April that was over here in this chart then we saw another peak of roughly 40% price appreciation of course with quite a bit of volatility since then for pretty much any day we saw the number of recurring Traders exceeding the number of first-time Traders and so most of the time the price did not appreciate further the number of transaction comes in waves sometimes it's high sometimes it's low usually when attention is low when there's not a lot of transactions it's also a good time to buy so for example over here right we had a low in transactions on the 30th and on the 31st of January that was over here in the price and then of course as trading volume increases again especially during the end of February of this year we are seeing the massive price increases now I always like to look at what a small retail doing versus what are the whales doing because that can give us an idea of whether or not currently the price action is manipulated this is the fraction of trading volume split up by different wallet sizes and I've removed here small retail that's all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the token we've got only wallets that have more than $11,000 and when this is peing this tends to be a sign that the price action is mainly caused by the large players so this is what I believe is going on over here this is not retail buying this is large whales getting in now I think it makes sense to be somewhat cautious with memec coin trading on Solana right now and that's because of the following a good sign is that most of total value locked increase happened on Solana in the last days when comparing this to other chains right the one month change the 7-Day change was pretty good for Solana it wasn't as good for the other chains that's good however we have to consider upside potential it doesn't look like Bonk is that large when we order by liquidity on the Solana chain it looks like it's only at place number 11 but in terms of market cap for all mem coins across all chains Bon is already at number six it's got 2 billion of market cap with another 2x it would flip pay and be among the top three meme coins so it's very very very unlikely that Bon will do another 10x from here it's simply already that large the reason why the liquidity pool on the Solana chain is so small is because a lot of the bankk has already moved to centralized exchanges because have a look at this most trading volume now happens on binance coinbase okx and gate.io it doesn't happen anymore on radium on any decentralized exchanges this is now in the hands of the big guys there's another problematic sign in this market the stable coin market cap isn't growing anymore so there's no more new Fiat getting deposited on centralized exchanges that then send this over to tether for example that then pushes up various altcoins the stablecoin market cap isn't growing anymore for roughly 1 month I have a look at this this is specific to Solana this is the Solana price divided by the ethereum price so we're looking now at relative performance to ethereum and this is a very long-term chart we had an historical high in September of 2021 another high in November of 2021 then we got very close to that high in December of last year we reached those highs in March and April of this year now we are very close to this again the air might get thin here and of course there is a ton of correlation between Solana and Bon so when Solana is going down then the US dollar valuation of Bonk is very likely going to go down as well let's look at Bonk relative to Solana how much outperformance can we expect as can be seen in this chart over here this is Bonk relative to S so so the Bonk price divided by the Solana price this comes in waves of attention currently we are somewhat elevated again but still what's really the upside here relative to Solana maybe 15% but the downside almost 40% and at the same time Solana itself is already expensive at the same time it's one of the largest meme coins already and we are not seeing a lot of new firsttime Traders coming in in the last days on chain all of this makes me skeptical I'm not saying that it's impossible for Bon to go further up from here but I'm not sure if the risk is really worth the reward I believe that Meme coins are really a game of asymmetric returns as in most of the time we might might be losing but in the few times where we win we want to get multiple X returns with Bonk we take on the risk of a meme coin but we don't necessarily have a 10x upside anymore simply because it's already so large I'm simply just sharing my data here what you do with that data is of course up to you you make your own decisions if you

look at the onchain metrix let's try to figure out how much longer this R can last let's see who's buying and selling here so we're currently at a price of 5072 we are up 142% in this week and the question is are we going to pump and dump or are we going to go for another lck up we're not going to find answers like this on the website the is simply just marketing we want to look at the data most people are not considering let's first see if the numbers align on Twitter we've got roughly 177,000 followers in telegram we've got roughly 7,000 members and on chain we've got roughly 20,000 holders so all of those numbers are in a similar ballpark no red flags here then let's have a look at the market cap how much higher could coala ai go relative to other meme coins what's the potential upside we are at a market cap of of 66 million roughly which is not too large for a meme coin we have meme coins in the hundreds of millions some even in the billions so just in terms of market cap a 10x is very much doable now let's dive into the data on chain let's have a look at all of those holders let's have a look at the whales let's have a look at the small wallets because the nice thing about koala AI is that most trading volume still happens directly on the Solana chain most trading volume happens on radium yes the token can be bought on Mexi and gate.io as well but this is definitely not where the price Discovery happens most trading volume still happens on Solana directly now here's something noteworthy it seems like recently the number of investors is expanding quite rapidly so that's what we want right we want to see more and more new investors coming into a memec coin because the growing investor base means potentially a rising price when we look at the number of recurring Traders versus firsttime Traders over time we now see since the 19 of October thousands of new wallets coming in this is good at the same time the transaction count is also increasing that also looks good but have a look at this the 24-hour trading volume is 2.2 million of the market cap of 66 million and we look at similarly sized meme coins the trading volume tends to be higher right the CHS token has almost 5 million of trading volume Mani has 10 million even the daddy token has 7 million so for whatever reason the trading volume in US Dollars isn't actually that high relative to its market cap it seems like there's not that much attention just in terms of dollars but the number of wallets is shooting up what's going on let's look at the trading volume in US Dollars and let's look at this in terms of Trader segments we see that trading volume and attention comes in waves that's not necessarily something very specific to the koala AI I token and it looks like a lot of that trading volume happens by those small retail wallets which would be good Wales tend to sell their backs faster than retail retail tends to just buy and hold for long term thus when a lot of retail investors get into a token the price should stabilize at higher prices more sustainably now here are numbers that aren't that pretty on the left are the number of wallets that have at current prices roughly $11,000 worth of koala AI tokens and this is not increasing over time so it seems like retail isn't really that interested in the token yes in the last week we have seen a few new retail wallets roughly 80 new wallets with $1,000 entered but can that really justify a price increase of 170% in the last month for a token with a market cap of above 60 million now there is way more accumulation by medium-sized retail right so in the middle we've got the number of wallets with at least $10,000 worth of the token big whales though with more than and $100,000 worth of the token are not increasing in numbers now on the right side each and every of those wallets have at least 100,000 worth of the token so with 90 such wallets we've got at least 9 million worth of capital in those wallets the liquidity on chain though is just 1 million in other words there's a lot of tokens dormant in wallets that aren't actively traded that can be dumped at any point in time and most of that capital is in the hands of very large Wales and when we dive into this deeper we can actually see that we just look at the token bellance in US Dollars by those different cohorts that the Wales hold 60 million so there's 60 times more value in the hands of the Wales compared to what's traded in the liquidity pools we also see an interesting Cliff Happening Here on the 25th of August suddenly the token balance by Wales increased from only 40% to almost 80% but during the time the price definitely didn't change that much right this was a change of tens of millions of dollars and then have a look at this the number of unique holders over time a sudden step function happening on the 9th of September of this year we moved from 14,000 small retail wallets to 19,000 small retail wallets but again the price didn't really do that much for a change of 5,000 wallets my impression is that koala AI is massively manipulated there is not necessarily organic growth here we don't see a lot of organic Demand by retail we see a lot of tokens been held by the Wales and we don't necessarily see that many new holders with that recent price pump my impression is that this is a pump and dump we are pumping now we are up 140% in the week but I think it's very likely that we are going to dump at one point it might not be today it might not be tomorrow but who knows what happens in a month or two don't get me wrong I do believe believe it's now the time to trade meme coins and I do believe there are some opportunities but I don't think it's in koala AI I think it's potentially in things like goat or let's say it used to be in things like goat so we discussed goat on the 18th of October in our premium membership we looked at the onchain metrics we looked at the influencers that bought the 18th of October is over here since then the price went up by 120% and so I believe that's the approach that's much more fruitful we are tracking various influencers we tracking various successful Traders for example Kyle chesse that bought gold early we've got 12 of its wallets of more than 400 wallets that we track on total we've also got wallets by Paulo do Sol who made a lot of very very nice calls we've got six of his wallets those are not public wallets right we did our research to find those wallets we've also got 33 wallets of crypto banter one of the largest crypto YouTube channels that definitely move the market and so seeing what those people are doing getting aler whenever they buy and sell that's I think the best approach combined of course with onair analytics to figure out if Ries are natural and when people potentially buy and sell we want to have a deep look into the current momentum we want to know if retail still continues buying I share my trades of course in premium as well every time I close and open a position I announce this over here and so feel free to have a look at this it's down below it's the bigcoin trade.com there's also a onee money back guarantee where it will refund you 100% if you don't like it simply just mess message me so to sum it all up I don't think that the rally in koala AI is organic it looks like there's a lot of manipulation going on it looks like there's a lot of ownership by the Wales and it doesn't seem like retail is accumulating long term we are pumping now but longterm I don't think we will pump Forever at some point those waves are going to take profit at some points that manipulation will stop it's better to look for the next opportunity it's better to look at something that actually gets bought if you got some value out this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regly a like for very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on premium and see you in the next

fascinating in a market of calmness where pretty much nothing is going up one token one mem coin is standing out and that's Maga or Mega make America great again the Trump meme coin now let's have a look at what's driving this R let's have a look at who's buying here is this small retail or is this the large whale investors let's look at the data most people are not considering so today we are up by 33% we are above $6 now so that's the chart today but since listing on coin market cap in the middle of August of last year we went up by more than 36,000 per. and the nice thing about this meme coin is that pretty much all of the supply is circulating so there is no more Supply expansion no more potential additional tokens that could hit the market rewarding the early team the early buyers this is a pretty fair player versus player game and so in the last 6 hours Trump was one of the most traded tokens directly on the ethereum chain and this is the long-term chart in wrapped ethereum because this is fundamentally very important to understand altcoins are closely tied to the price of ethereum because altcoins are pulled with reped ethereum so when ethereum goes down Say by 10% then altcoins in general also go down by 10% because altcoins are priced in ethereum not in US Dollars and so we have to also look at relative performance to ethereum this is not a US dollar chart this is a ethereum chart and what's nice about this is is that even though this is a risky meme coin it tends to not underperform ethereum when attention is low very often we see massive sell-offs whenever attention is low whenever trading volume is low there is of course volatility here as well so temporarily a drop of 60% but given that the market cap is relatively large and given that the market in general isn't super hyped in the last weeks seeing that the Trump token stays somewhat stable versus ethereum is a positive thing and we are just starting again a potential next rally of attention right we've just peaked in trading volume again if we see further trading volume increases and the price is likely going to also continue to rise potentially creating a new all-time high denominated in wrapped ethereum now let's have a look at the onchain data let's have a look at who's buying and selling here let's check out if it's the whales that are manipulating the price or if retail is actually jumping on there how potentially organic is this rally because the less manipulation there is the longer a rally can last right if it's only one person that's buying in with a lot of capital then that's way less sustainable compared to when it's many many people that jump on this and so I've built a tool to make exactly that differentiation to count the number of retail investors versus whale investors so on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 150 Maga Trump tokens so that's now more than 6,000 people there's pretty much a constant GR growth of retail investors here retail in aggregate doesn't sell tokens they simply just buy it in the middle we've got medium-sized retail so that's now a 10x in minimum holding that's 1,500 tokens that the current price that's roughly $10,000 so we've got $1,000 on the left $10,000 in the middle and on the right we've got the Wales that's now a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the mega token isn't that interesting the Wales stopped accumulating already in the middle of January the number of retail wallets roughly tripled since the middle of January let's have a look at the price since the middle of January it's going up it pretty much made a 20x so clearly the token is driven by retail demand it's not driven by the Wales and so in the last month ethereum went down by 19% but the mega Trump token went up by 1.5% so measured in ethereum mega went up more and more people get onto the token and so here are the same charts that we just looked at before but only for the last month again retail continues to accumulate very steadily and now is even stepping up the game with the recent rally same for mediumsized retail and also the whales they are not selling they are following suit and so the nice thing about this token is that it's not yet dominated by the centralized exchanges again if a lot of tokens are held by centralized exchanges there might be manipulation but in our case 70% of all of trading volume happens on Unis swap directly on the ethereum chain it's very good because this tells us that the statistics that we have here and here are very reliable there is one thing that might overshadow all of this and that's this chart over here this is the market cap of all stable coins unfortunately that's not growing in the last two weeks so we seem to be now at a phase in the market where no more capital is flowing in where we're not going to see increased prices just because more more people more and more Capital deposit Fiat on those centralized exchanges that then turn into stable coins so when this is going up that's great for altcoins because more capital is being deployed when this going sideways we're simply just in a sideways market and that could then of course also hurt meme coins like Mega so instead of betting on the US dollar price further going up maybe it makes sense to short ethereum at the same time and just bet on the reped ethereum price going up so you want to be buying Trump with borrowed reped ethereum not directly with stable coins if you don't know how to do this feel free to check out premium there's a dedicated video on how to

to know where the price is going but I've been in crypto for long enough to be able to identify extreme situations and Dogecoin is definitely at a very very extreme level right now now in this video I want to show charts that you have probably never seen of do we are not going to look at the US dollar chart we're going to look at dominance charts we're going to look at relative valuation charts to bitcoin and to ethereum and when we look at this and we combine all of those findings it really doesn't look that great now this is where we are currently at and this is the chart everybody looks at Dogecoin is at 36 Cents and it went up by more than 200 100% in the last month and it almost hit an all-time high recently it's very close to its initial trading price from June 2021 now this is not the first video on Doge on this channel I published one a few days ago and we looked at this chart here this is the Doge dominance or how much percent of the entire cryptocurrency market cap is in Doge historically we had been higher at roughly 4% we then crashed down quite a bit by 80% in terms of relevance to less than 1% of all of crypto being Doge and it appears as if we're hitting a resistance over here now does this line have to hold of course it doesn't but it is another potential signal that the air might be getting thin but let's compare more this chart shows the relative valuation of Doge to bitcoin so it Compares had you bought Dogecoin or Bitcoin what would have performed better and for the last year there wasn't really a big difference between Dogecoin and Bitcoin both performed well but with this recent rally we've seen an outperformance of almost 200% now unfortunately this current rally looks very similar to what we have seen in the past let's just overlay is there a bit more upside potential yeah maybe it's maybe a potential reward of 16% but a potential value destruction of 66 maybe even 75% now the comparison to bitcoin is probably not the best because Dogecoin actually is not that well correlated to bitcoin it's more correlated to the other altcoins it's more correlated to ethereum for example when there's more correlation between two assets it means that the two assets tend to move more in sync with one another so when one asset goes up the other asset tends to go up as well and vice versa now this connection isn't as strong for Dogecoin to bitcoin compared to Dogecoin to ethereum that hints that the factors that influence the price might be more common between ethereum and Dogecoin in other words maybe Dogecoin competes for similar kinds of capital that ethereum is made for let me show you what I mean this is a correlation coefficient between different crypto assets and whenever the correlation coefficient is close to one It means that the assets move very much in sync to one another when it's at zero there is no no connection now check this out the correlation coefficient of Dogecoin to ethereum is 0.59 while the correlation coefficient of Dogecoin to bitcoin is only 0.44 this is for the 90day correlation and over time we can see especially in the recent past there is quite a bit of a connection especially when we look at this at the oneyear correlation coefficient ethereum and Dogecoin tend to move in the same ways Bitcoin and Dogecoin has a smaller correlation coefficient and so instead of comparing Dogecoin to bitcoin let's compare Dogecoin to ethereum and that's then the chart that we get we see a somewhat stable trading range also a somewhat tight trading range we sometimes break out above or below but most of the time we are in that trading range now there is one problem here and that's a connection between attention trading volume and price the more attention there is on an asset the higher the price goes the problem in crypto is that attention moves from asset to asset the attention doesn't stay on Dogecoin forever it might move to the next token at some point and so just let me show you what I mean this is the trading volume over time and have a look at what happens when the trading volume spikes for example over here or over here we might still see a subsequent short squeeze sometimes that short squeeze can exceed the prior high and sometimes it doesn't but after that squeeze we pretty much go straight down and so I believe that's very likely going to happen for for Doge yet again now let's say you don't trust in those charts let's say you're still bullish on do or let's say you only want to take part of the profit and you still want to ride this way for a bit longer what kind of upside potential is there realistically speaking how much more outperformance can we get now it's important to think in terms of outperformance because if you simply just mirror the performance of Bitcoin then why even own Dogecoin Dogecoin is much more risky than Bitcoin if you don't get that risk compensated then there's no reason to hold Doge then simply just buy Bitcoin so more risk should equal more reward now how much potential reward for Dogecoin is there now have a look at the market caps Dogecoin is now at the market cap of 53 billion if it was to double it would be larger than Solana there's plenty of people that call for a Dogecoin at $1 but is that likely going to happen is Dogecoin going to have a larger market cap compared to tether which is the largest of the stable coins even after a doubling from here right even with a dolge coin at 70 cents Solana would be smaller and Solana generates a ton of trading volume and revenue in the last 24 hours we have seen 6 billion worth of trading volume on Solana and that currently generates more than 2 million every single day in trading fees is Dogecoin long-term really worth that much don't get me wrong I've got nothing against meme coins but I do believe that there's better opportunities in the meme M coin market now memecoins are actually one of the best performing Assets in crypto right now the Elon mus Inspire tokens went up by more than 114% in the last week the pump. fun ecosystem which is a Launchpad on Solana went up by 113% the Dark theme tokens went up by 82% it's all memes it's all risk on Capital but what kind of memes do so well it's the memes that don't yet have billions above billions of market cap it's the smaller tokens that do better for example here the ACT token went up by 2,000% in the last week we talked about this on this channel as well it's got a market cap of half a billion or here peanut now at 800 million went up by 677 peanut is currently at 88 cents per token and we got a buying alert for peanut when it was still at 3 cents so check this out Stan crypto bought peanut for 3 cents Crypt banter did the same that was on November 3rd how did we get those signals through tracking of crypto wallets so the blockchain is 100% transparent we can actually know what kind of wallet buys what and sells what at what point in time now the art in all of this is to find what influencer or what kind of Market maker owns what wallet once we have that knowledge of who owns what we can get signals and we did a lot of research we've got 33 wallets by Crypt banter alone in total we track more than 400 wallets here's the YouTube channel of Crypt benter they've got more than a million subscribers they defin defitely move markets and so I made an entire video course on just how to find wallets how to then afterwards track them and how to then subsequently interpret the signals from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com there are not just tutorials on wallet tracking there's also tutorials on onchain analytics on plotting relative valuation charts on portfolio Management on diversification Etc it's all up for your bench watching it's all up for your education and so when once we've got a signal we of course also discuss when to buy when to sell in dedicated groups in premium it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't make money or in case you don't like premium just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% there's zero risk for you I am not saying that Dogecoin has to crash tomorrow but what I am saying is that the risk to reward is not worth it the real rewards are in the smaller tokens and a I and meme coins are definitely now on the run if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I pr youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow

last week the chams meme coin on the binance smart chain outperformed most other meme coins now let's have a look at who's buying here who's actually pushing the price up let's see how much longer this really can last using onchain analytics now here's an overview of meme coins ordered by the performance in the last week teams had been the third best performing token just behind Nero on Eve and we've already made a video on Nero on this channel just recently chams is also a relatively large token on the binance smart chain it's it's got 3.1 million liquidity and since it's listing on coin market cap it went up by more than 240% now what's driving all of this we are not going to get the answer on the website it's simply just like any other meme coin we want to look at the data most people are not looking at now today we've got an overhang of roughly 300 buyers so that's 2,700 buyers versus 2,428 Sellers and the token is not just available decentralized it can also be bought on xt. comom which is affiliate to binance now on chain we've got 22,000 holders roughly on Twitter we've got roughly 40,000 followers so that's interesting double the number of followers on telegram we've only got 3,000 members so something is odd over here something seems to not really align normally those numbers are much closer to one another now let's try to figure out what's going on by looking onchain on the transactions on the binance smart chain we had the launch on the 28th of September and on the 5th of October we had a lot of new users so this chart here on the left shows a number of new users versus returning users we can also see on the exact same day how a lot of new buyers entered the token and so here's the 5th of October since all of those new buyers went in we saw the price appreciating by more than 135% now here's something very odd and I've never seen this for any other token ever and I've analyzed hundreds of tokens what we see over here is the number of small holders medium-sized holders and large holders the number of small holders have at current prices roughly $500 worth of the token in their wallet for the chart in the middle it's a 10x so that's $5,000 worth of the token on the right we've got $50,000 worth of the token now why is that so strange the beginning Spike here could be interpreted as an airdrop so that's okay but the holder development subsequently is very odd there was pretty much no accumulation by small retail whatsoever and now in the last 2 days it's growing somewhat okay that's understandable what's not understandable though is that the number of medium-sized wallets that have $5,000 worth of the token how this is going down that much it's also very strange that when we go at 10x in minimum holding how the number of wallets barely changes so there's around 13,000 wallets with $500 but there's around 12,000 wallets with $5,000 that does not make sense normally this number shrinks by at least 60 maybe 70% the chart on the right makes a bit more sense this is simply just accumulation by the Wales but still each of those wallets has $50,000 worth of the token while the liquidity pool only has 3 million so 100 such wallets is already more than there is liquid floating around in other words there's a lot of wallets with very large token Holdings that simply receiv the token and they never had to buy the token and it seems like the balances between those wallets is still shuffling around I do not believe that this is all organic I've never seen something like this normally we see the accumulation by small holders the most constant the left chart tends to usually rise the chart in the middle might go sideways but usually Also Rises and the chart on the right could go down when the price is going up as the whales take profit seeing such a disparity between the Holdings and seeing how there's almost as many wallets with $5,000 worth of the token compared to 500 all of this Rings The Alarm bells for me I don't dare to predict where the price is going maybe the whales are going to continue to push up this price potentially generating more attention potentially generating more buys by small retail that being said I do believe there's a lot of wash trading going on I do believe that this is not all organic adoption this is not hundreds and thousands of people getting excited about CHS this looks much more like a game of musical chairs of some people that have too much money to play with now I hope you can see how useful onchain and analytics are it's very nice to spot potential red flags that aren't visible in the price charts otherwise I'm using those analytics pretty much with any token that I buy and I also share that knowledge in premium so the link is down below it's that Bitcoin trade.com there's a link to our onchain analytics tools there's a video on how to use them there's a tool for the binance smart chain but also ethereum polygon avalange Etc and a separate tool for Solana as well there's also a dedicated video on how to build such tools and yeah by now we've got 100 of tutorial videos feel free to check it out in case you're interested in leveling up your crypto game and to not get always Rock pulled there's of course also a community where we discuss various altcoins that are dedicated chats in telegram so again if you want to level up your crypto game and if you enjoy memec coin trading then check it out the Bitcoin trade.com if you don't want to get that deep into the analytics there's also a free telegram this is where we have mainly small talk feel free to join there as well link is as well down below looking forward to seeing you there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh9fmmHtxcI,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum',

land let's talk about the Mana token let's try to figure out what's currently happening why is the price ring so much is there so much usage increase is there potential manipulation going on what's driving currently the price let's have a look at the buyers let's have a look at the sellers let's try to figure out whether or not it still makes sense to buy Mana now this is a very datadriven Channel and so we start off with the onchain data on the usage of the central land we actually don't see much of a change in the last year this is the number of buyers on decentraland and it's just hovering around 10 to 30 a day now here is the decentraland trading volume over time and we've seen a massive rally a lot of attention at the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022 but then things tended to flatten out this is a cumulative chart the more honest chart is probably this it chose the weekly trading volume and at one point we had been above 4 million in a single week now we are at 17,000 the decentraland items minted on polygon is also in a not much better Trend and so what on Earth is going on why is the price up 30% today 85% this week and almost 160% this month now at one point Mana was above $5 now we are still below one so the current really in the grand scheme of things doesn't look like that much but let's continue deeper into the buying and selling Behavior again with onchain data now Mana is listed on several chains but most holders are on the ethereum chain we've got almost 300,000 holders but not all of those holders are created equal what we've got over here is the number of retail investors versus whale investors and the way we differentiate here is simply with a minimum holding threshold so how many tokens at minimum need to be in a wallet to be counted in such a chart and on the left side that threshold is 2,000 tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I would still consider retail now there are not 300,000 of such wallets there's only 16,000 but still when a wallet owns just $1,000 worth of the token or a bit more than that it's not yet AA right it's still retail demand now in the middle we've got a slightly different chart this curve looks very very different to the left one and that's is because the minimum holding threshold here is a 10x from the left side so this is not 2,000 tokens it's now 20,000 tokens or a bit over $10,000 worth of the token on the right another 10x so that's not more than $100,000 worth of the token so this here on the left is retail this in the middle is mediumsized holders and on the right we've got the whales now those are alltime charts right they start in 2018 what I find very interesting about those charts is that none of those holders over the long period actually dumped the token a lot yes we did have our corrections but after launch most of those wallet cohorts continue to accumulate over the long term or at least kept the number of holders yet we see a price chart like this and so that's another reminder of how important toomics are it's very important to see how much is the supply expanding who gets the tokens and that's a problem that a lot of gamei tokens in the early days had right they gave out tokens left and right and as long as the game grows very quickly of course the price can also keep up but once the growth stops even if people simply just continue holding all of those additional Supply that gets sent out as incentives depresses the price a lot that's why the long-term chart looks like this while the long-term holder charts don't really look that bad and so here's what happened in the last month right we went up in the price by 150% the number of holders though did not go up it rather tended to go down for small retail but also tended to rather stay stable for the other wallet cohorts there's really not a lot of new demand there's really not a lot of new investors onchain the onchain demand does not explain a 150% price increase yes there are new wallets interacting with the token over time and that is accelerating but at the same time we've got a lot of returning users and that's always higher than the number of users so it's mainly bot accounts trading against one another and so here's the Mana chart that most people look at right it's the Mana price in us doar over time on a linear scale but instead of looking at this with the common linear scale we can also look at this in terms of logarithmic scale now same distances have the same kind of percent returns so we don't look at Deltas in US Dollars we look at Deltas in percentage returns a drop over here of 60% is the same as a drop over here of 60% but instead of looking at this long-term US dollar chart we can also look at this relative to bitcoin and then we get this chart here here's again the price versus Bitcoin on a logarithmic scale and since launch we actually went up by a bit under 50% and so it appears as if this long-term downward Trend might now turn around we have seen somewhat similar Ries in the past but this could be a potential turnaround now since day one people compare the Mana token with the sand token right they're both OG game fire token let's have a look at the relative performance of Mana to sand now this is the long-term performance of sand relative to bitcoin it doesn't look that different to the long-term chart of Mana relative to bitcoin but what we've got over here is now Mana relative to sand so it initially underperformed massively but for whatever reason it might be toomics it might be usage of the game Mana outperformed sand since the end of 2021 by quite a bit it's a growth of 114% but it is is now coming down again now all of those charts look pretty scary right the long-term trend is still bearish especially versus the safe Bitcoin when we invest into a cryptocurrency that's riskier than Bitcoin we want to get long-term outperformance we don't want to get crushed by 90% and more that being said a lot of those charts went down because all of crypto didn't do that well all of the altcoins rather didn't do that well so this is the others dominance this is how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 and this went down by 47% in the last 2 years and since we seem to be seeing somewhat of a floor and we went up by 17% recently people are talking about a potential altcoin season again that thesis would be supported by the stablecoin market cap we continue to see more and more money flowing into crypto so this is the market cap of D tether usdc and B USD over time over here we see the collapse of teruna of the anchor protocol of the US stable coin during that downtrend we also saw FTX collapsing and since October of last year we see an expansion of crypto again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the stablecoin market cap goes up whenever Fiat is deployed so the way this works is when you send your hard-earned fiat currency to a centralized exchange say binance binance will then send over that Fiat to a stable coin issuer the stable coin issuer will then issue tokens they will then mint tokens and keep hopefully the money in their accounts and so we can see whenever new stable coins get minted or get destroyed and currently they get minted in other words a lot of Fiat is flowing into crypto and that is at an all-time high now in the last week the centraland and sand and those larger tokens perform pretty well so here's the centraland here is sandbox here is Stella I recently published a video on Stella as well and those are all performances around 100% I still believe though that the best risk reward is still in the meme coins it's in the smaller cap meme coins have a look at those performances here here we saw big doc think going up by 67% in the last week or lucky coin by more than 400% bully by almost 300% Etc you get the gist right most of those performances are in the market caps of hundreds of millions not in the billions the big question always is how can we get one of those outperformers early right how can we spot a small altcoin that has the potential to 3 4 5x in a single week my answer to this is the following it's shown over here on the screen it's wallet tracking so I like to track the wallets of influential people of top traders of people that move markets of influencers I like to look at what are they buying and what are they selling and for example over here 2 days ago we had the martini guy that bought the moon token and that was directly on pump. fund so that was the Solana blockchain and he bought this for 4 z12 and we then of course discussed this at length but have a look at what happened to the token it made a massive massive run up more than 1,000% Then Came Crashing Down no surprise here but have a look at the current price it's currently at 493 so even after this massive collapse the price is still up by 8X or so that's how early some of those signals can be right how else can we find tokens like this that shwed up like that this was literally a 100x since the signal now here is the guy that we are tracking here this is the martini guy he's got 149,00 subscribers and of course when he talks about a token that token generates some attention and the price tends to go up and so here's the Magic in all of this through onchain analytics we found various of his wallets and we track his wallets we've got 12 of his wallets in total finding those wallets is the actual art of the game now not all of those signals go up that much that quickly but still have a look at this this is Alex Becker he bought the Spectra token at $238 and again that was just a bit over 24 hours ago that's up now 14% and probably you know Alex Becker he's got 1.5 million subscribers The Reason probably why the token didn't go up much more yet is because he hasn't published a video on the token yet at least he didn't promote it recently here are the wallets that we Track by Alex Becker we've got 12 in total but there's also a way to get these kind of tokens even earlier to follow influencers that are a bit more risky in their approach for example here we've got crypto gains that bought Spectre already at 16 so that was way way back in the day it was over here since then we are up more than 1,500% and so here has crypto gains he's also got a bit over 100,000 followers so again when he talks about especially the smaller tokens they can get quite a bit of momentum we do have a few more of his wallets he tends to change wallets quite often we've got 55 that we are tracking in total by the way we track more than 400 wallets and so really this is I believe where the real Alpha is it's not buying those large cap cryptocurrencies with billions and billions of dollars it's buying the small ones but doing it smartly not just picking something Rand randomly in a list it's following the smart money it's following the people that tend to make very profitable trades and thus get very similar returns to them and so I like this approach that much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic so this is eight videos in total how can we find influencer wallets how can we track those influencer wallets and how can we interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's about back testing it's about portfolio diversification and risk management there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total once we have got a wallet signal we also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we also have to compare our onch analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first week and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you so can the centraland can the Mana talk can go higher yes of course it can but probably there's quite a bit of manipulation by the centralized exchanges involved here as well right they are the market makers they hold funds besides just the custody funds of the customers and they want to see as much volatility as possible volatility equals trading fees and liquidation fees they want to have active markets it's always hard to say what happens with a token once it's in the hand of the centralized exchanges once they are the ones that move the price if it's not the onchain metrics that move the price but it's the centralized exchanges it's the market makers they can do anything and it's pretty much impossible to anticipate what they are thinking and so really the best risk versus reward I believe is not trying to beat the casino I think it's trying to beat the people that aren't that skilled it's trying to use data where it's public it's trying to trade directly on the Chain if you got some value all this video Fe you to subscribe I publish you regly a like

$100 million in market cap but the price has doubled in the last month alone now let's have a look at how much longer this really can last let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people are not considering so here we are we are currently at 0.1 cents per WJ token and the price went up by 110% in the last month most of those gains happened just in the last few days we've got 45,00 followers on Twitter or on the xplatform 9,000 subscribers to the telegram and on chain we have 19,000 holders so the numbers somewhat align it is surprising though that there's more Twitter followers than holders on chain this can be explained though with the liquidity on centralized exchanges not all of VJ is held directly on chain on ethereum in fact the majority of trading happens in those black boxes we've got gate.io we've got Maxi we've got bitmart and bit get and htx is part of the party as well now let's have a look at the retail investor versus the whale investor so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1 million WJ tokens so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 and this tended to go down up until the middle of October of last year then we subsequently had a recovery in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding compared to the left chart so that's not a minimum holding of $10,000 worth of the token on the right and another 10x so a minimum of $100,000 worth of the token we see that turn around pretty much everywhere in October of last year the growth rate is slightly different though so the number of retail investors grew by roughly 50% the number of wh investors grew slightly less now what happened in the last month where the price more than doubled here the same kind of charts but just for the last month we see accumulation across the board and especially the whales they tended to have bought the most they increased by roughly 10 % the number of retail investors only grew by roughly 3% now especially for meme coins it's important that the number of investors overall is growing with time right the more people invest in a token the higher the price can go and I like to look at the relationship between new investors and returning investors over time and there is something very interesting for VJ here check this out on the left side we see the number of new investors on ethereum every day and they shot up on the 7th and 8th of October on the right side we've got the fraction of new users relative to returning users and that peaked also on the 8th of October now the 9th of October isn't yet over so we can't really say anything about that data point but it seems as if in the last 48 hours a lot of attention from new Outsiders came onto the token now here is how that happened this is the 7th of October and we see how this started a really quite a bit and this is no surprise right new investors again means an expanding base means again Rising prices and usually those relies last for longer than just 2 days I've looked at those kind of charts for many different alt coins over quite a long period of time and usually when we see a lot of new investors jumping in that also means that the price continues to rise for at least a week or so now unfortunately there is one effect that we can't really quantify and that potentially overhangs this rally and that's the ownership by centralized exchanges the largest holder of the token is gay IO the second largest is Maxi the third largest is bitet and unfortunately the balances of those centralized exchanges is not necessarily growing over here is the largest wallet this is the second largest and this is the third largest we're either going sideways or even down now how much impact does this have potentially on the price let's check again gate.io here's the cold storage wallet of gate.io they've got 5.7 Million worth of WJ and when we look at the liquidity pools on chain on ethereum the largest of the pools has only 5.6 million and that's half reped ethereum the other half wack in other words if gate IO was to drop all of their Holdings then the price of Bojack would easily fall by 75% or more so there is risk but there's also new investors coming in and there is potential upside as well because again the market cap of VJ isn't really large WJ has a market cap of only 75 million and it's very small compared to other meme coins if rojack was to double it would be at a similar level to moodang if it was to triple it would be close to the mega Trump token or to Apu and even if it was to 4X we'd still barely beat the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Tenino token by the way I made a video on that token as well recently so there is interest across the board for WJ now both retail and the Wales are buying if the centralized exchanges don't decide to suddenly dump on retail then I do believe a multiple X from here is very much possible I publish videos on this channel regularly on various meme coins if you don't want to

interesting the memec coin on the ton blockchain continues to rise in price even though the general mem coin Market isn't doing too well what's behind all of this this is not the first video on NCoin I've made three already let's have a look at some data again that most people are not considering so here we are we are currently at 1.4 cents up by 7% today almost 190% this month and yes we did have our initial dump in not coin but the big question is does it make sense to buy rather low now is the momentum turning around it's all about buying low selling High let's have a look at what potentially is behind all of this now NCoin is on the ton blockchain and ton is also doing pretty well it's up 5% today 20% this month and over the longer time frame over the last year it more than 5x and so there is plenty of attention on not coin it's one of the best performing videos 33,000 views 3 weeks ago this is where this discuss the fundamentals of not coin if you can call it fundamentals right in the end it's still a mem coin but the reason why this meme coin is doing so well is this here that's the total value locked on the ton blockchain which is currently at 667 million a lot of the recent growth happened because of dust a growth in total value locked of 472 in the last month and that's because there is a lot of return to be made in the liquidity pools so if you deposit you're not ton so a 50/50 share on dust. get an APR of 48% that's not too bad you can also simply deposit your ton but that's relative to usdt so you have a bit more of an impermanent loss risk here that returns 83% apy those apys get generated through the trading fees right as there is trading happening on decentralized exchanges on Dust for example there is fees that get generated and parts of those fees go to the liquidity pool providers so the apy is directly linked to the trading volume the more attention there is the more trading volume there is the more transaction fees are generated and so this is a self-reinforcing cycle as there's more and more trading happening more and more transaction fees are generated thus more and more people put their money into the liquidity pools increasing the total value locked increasing the demand for ton coin itself as well and with it mem coins on the ton blockchain can do quite nice as well but again the volatility and the risk is much higher for not compared to ton now let's have a look at ton coin not at not coin but at ton coin there's two versions where you can actually look at the onchain analytics there's one version on the ethereum chain with 24,000 holders there's another version on the binance smart chain with 51,000 holders now here's the ethereum based token this time we look at the number of holders based on different holding thresholds so 200 tokens minimum on the left 2,000 tokens minimum holding on the middle and 20,000 tokens minimum holding on the right so those are very long-term charts 2,000 tokens is equal to roughly $1,500 so that's what I'd consider retail in the middle is mediumsized retail so $115,000 in the right is the Wales $150,000 and when we zoom in a little bit when we just look at the last month we see that a lot of the growth happens because of the smaller wallets so ton went up by 20% in the last month the number of retail holders grew by a bit more than 10% maybe 12 13% mediumsized retail grew a bit less the number of whales is harder to tell simply because the sample size is so low but look at this right the number of holders is a very very steady graph compared to the price chart so there's every now and then a whale that does take profit here here are the same charts on the binance smart chain here the growth isn't that constant so yes we do see growth as well here for smaller retail but there is more profit taking most of demand now happens on the ethereum Chain now why does the chart of not coin look much more like a pump and dump compared to the chart of ton coin which tends to be going up a bit more steadily I believe that's because of manipulation and leverage let's have a look at the Perpetual Futures market so that's the market where people can bet on a price without actually buying on spot you can bet on the price with leverage and then market makers might hatch against that leverage so have a look at this so that's a spot Market most of the not coin transactions happen on binance on a centralized exchange now here's the same for the Perpetual Futures Market just check this out blin and binance and blin is just a rebranded binance both of those together have more than $1 billion doar of trading volume in the last 24 hours almost the entire market cap of not coin has changed hands in value on the Perpetual Futures Market again in just the last 24 hours compare this with ton coin for ton coin we only had 200 million traded on Perpetual Futures in the last 24 hours 200 million with a market cap of 18 billion so there's way way more short-term speculation happening for not coin and that's what's creating all of that volatility this Market is very dangerous right now it's 100% player versus player there's no more new money flowing into crypto we can see this for example at the stable coin market cap chart so that's this chart over here it adds up several stable coins and when we are in a bull market we tend to see Fiat flowing into crypto when the bull market starts to die then we simply just go sideways and at some point things turn around and then the market is shrinking this here by the way was the Terra Luna collapse this is what this turned all around currently again we are unfortunately just going sideways which is dangerous in a market like this I'm not necessarily a fan of memec coin trading instead I prefer to bet on falling prices because most altcoins tend to underperform bitcoin especially in a bare market and we are not yet in a clear bare Market but we are definitely not in an expanding Market either and so I simply just short graphs like this I bet on this graph to continue falling it has been falling for a long long time and I've got that position open for a long long time since beginning of the year this went down by 50% already and I continue holding this but I'm not sharing what that asset is here on the public YouTube if you're interested in shorting the asset that I just showed feel free to check it out the premium membership this is where I've got several tutorials on how to bet on falling prices and how to make money with falling prices what potential assets to short where to find good assets to short and yes I believe in stacking the odds in our favor in a market that's not expanding you want to bet on falling prices in a bull market you want to find ALT coins to buy but currently when no money is flowing into crypto and it's 100% player versus player then why risk buying bottoms like this right the bottom can continue bottoming right buying low doesn't mean buying the lowest and the price already is bleeding for quite a while for NCoin yes we could short NCoin as well but why not be safe and short something that has a very constant history of underperforming I will continue to make updates on NCoin if you don't want to miss those feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow feel free to to

Prediction, Apu longterm, Apu Tokenomics,  #apu #btc #crypto","the Appo mem coin on the ethereum chain is crashing today we did see a lot of gains in the last week now we are dipping down does it make sense to buy the dip let's have a look at the buyers and sellers let's have a look at some onchain data most people are not considering now I made a video on Apu 1 month ago and the video didn't perform that well the gray area is an average video the blue line is the Appo video but that's the problem with the YouTube algorithm when a token isn't yet well known you don't get a lot of exposure but have a look at the Apu chart this is when that video was published since then the price went up by roughly 600% and what we're seeing in the last few hours that's what I'm referring to with the crash down 25% if you want to be early next time then feel free to follow channels like this I publish videos regularly now Appo isn't that small anymore when we look at the ethereum chain and we order all assets on the entire Chain by liquidity then Apple is already at place number 24 so there's 3.2 million worth of liquidity and that's due to the massive rally that happened in the last weeks now here's the problem with early projects right when we buy a token just say one week after launch there is the real risk of getting potentially Ru pulled so there are various tools to try to mitigate that risk right we want to make the best risk adjusted bets we want to reduce risk as much as possible while keeping the upside High one tool that I personally like to use is Dex tool tools. so when you go on this website you search for a token address and you go here to the bottom left and you click on check audits that we can see the potential issues with a token and apple looked pretty clean more often than not you do get some red over here you get your buy and sell tax you get a modifiable tax in the worst case you even get a honey pot alert so that means you can buy the token but the smart contract doesn't allow you to sell it make sure that for any new unknown token that you consider trading that you potentially found on Dex screen.com that you also run this through Dex tools. now how does the market look like does it make sense to still buy into Apu how many people still get on the token why is the price currently crashing is this because retail is selling is this because the whales are taking profit what's going on here have a look at this this is the change in total value locked so in the capital locked up in the chain for the largest 10 block chains and have a look in the last month there weren't too many winners Bitcoin gained quite a bit because of the ordinance trading but besides that it's mainly the base chain and the binance smart chain that take all the profit there's also Merlin but Merlin is very risky and is still very small only eight protocols here and so have a look at ethereum where Apu is housed ethereum isn't doing that great in fact when we compare the ethereum market share over time we've seen first how a lot of compe gained more and more then terraluna collaps that's this yellow area over here but since that collapse ethereum hasn't gained any ground whatsoever it stays at around 58% of market share so by trading mem coins on ethereum you're not just paying the high gas fees you're also betting on a chain that seems to not really gain momentum against its competitors it does make sense to potentially focus more on the base chain right now but again let's have a look at buyers versus sellers for Apu on the ethereum Chain what we've got over here is the number of retail investors versus the number of Wales so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold roughly 1.8 million Apu tokens so that's roughly $1,000 at current prices that's what I'd consider small retail in the middle we've got a minimum holding threshold that's 10x from the left chart so that's now medium-sized retail a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 what do we see here we see that the Wales bought in the earliest we saw that the mediumsized whales took a bit longer to accumulate and we see that for retail they're even slower than that so the Wales finished their purchasing pretty much on the 17th of March while the number of retail investors still grew by another 3x so let's look at the price since the 17th of March that's over here so what we can tell for sure is that all of this price appreciation here is 100% driven by retail not anymore by the Wales now let's have a look at just the last month in the last month Apu went up by 470 per. the number of whale wallets went down slightly by 2% or so the number of medium-sized retail grew by a bit more than 20% the number of retail investors grew by more than 60% but yeah there is a bit of a problem with this chart right the number of retail investors isn't growing as quickly anymore we shot up since beginning of April but since the 14th of April so in the last 10 days or so that growth has slowed down a lot the 14th of April is over here so we don't yet see a crash in the price since that point in time but I would not be surprised whatsoever if now people that took this rally are starting to also take some profit now the momentum simply isn't the same anymore so again this is what mcoin speculation is all about you want to be early you don't want to buy when the whales aren't touching the token in anymore you want to buy with retail adoption and unfortunately that's slowing down for Apu thus I believe it's a good time to take profit at least partially the risk to reward is probably better in other places feel free to give this a like to support the channel to help it grow feel free to also check out premium where you can get access to this tool also a tutorial video on how to use this you can pluck in any ethereum token any base token any binance smart chain token

you need to understand to actually make money trading meme coins is look if you're watching this video odds are you're aware of the absolute Insanity going on in the meme coin market right now multiple people just became millionaires off of buying a coin named after a stupid Tik Tok Trend called chill guy no seriously you can just go check the blockchain I'm not making this stuff up Elon Musk literally just named a branch of the United States Government after Dogecoin the biggest memec coin in the world and price chart of that is moving accordingly meanwhile Tik tokers are finding out that anyone can buy these magic internet money coins and figuring out how easy it is to lose money if you don't know what you're doing it's time that we sit down and make a full a toz beginners guide on how to make sense of this whole crazy thing while the market is still hot because if you ask anybody who's been in crypto for a long time they will tell you the super hot moment in the market only last a very small amount of time so in today's video I'm going to give you a full raw guide on exactly how to trade meme coins all the way from Level zero buying your first bit of salana all the way through successfully making a trade by the time you leave this video you will have learned how to acquire salana so you can start trading mem coins how to set up your wallets and get onboarded to the best meme coin trading tools what settings to use on all of these tools and what all this stuff actually means I'm going to show you what places you need to look to actually find the right coins to buy and throughout this whole video I'm going to be explaining tons of new Concepts that may be foreign to you if you're new to these markets so if you hear stuff you don't understand don't worry just watch this whole video take notes and I got you along the way now before we jump in bear in mind that if you want to get fully up to speed learn how to trade and get access to the best tools not only for mem coins but the entire crypto market so that you can take advantage of this small Bull Run window that we have you can join my own private Trading Group Champs only we have a full-time team dedicated to educating you guys on the space and finding picks we run daily live trading streams with hundreds of live viewers and we have an extremely Advanced and comprehensive tool set for all of

Discord every single week fair warning we are raising prices again at the end of this month so if you want to trade with me and my people before that happens the link to join will be the first one down Below in the description I'll see you inside with that said let's jump right into the rest of this video and by the way for the purposes of this video I'm assuming you already know what a meme coin is if you don't know I'll link another one of my videos Down Below in the description that explains the concept all right so if you want to trade mem coin step one is actually going to be acquiring salana salana is the blockchain or base layer upon which basically all of the most popular meme coins are traded so if you don't already have salana either on a centralized exchange or on a wallet somewhere you're going to have to buy some and if you do already have that you can go ahead and skip this step now there's tons of different ways that you can go buy salana and then navigate out into the general crypto ecosystem but for the purpose of this video I'm just going to show you the simplest possible way and assume that a lot of you guys just want to be able to buy it straight from your phone with Apple pay or credit card now the fastest way to do that in 2024 is just going to be to use an app called moonshot that lets you buy meme coins with Apple pay or credit card I'll leave my partner link to go download that down below in the description now once you've downloaded moonshot and I'll literally do this live on screen for you guys all you're going to do is go to salana click buy you're going to input the amount that you want to buy I'll do $100 for this video and then you're just going to be able to swipe to buy salana on this app now in order to actually go and trade meme coins you're going to have to move this salana to your own self- custodi wallet called Phantom you can think of a phantom wallet as basically just like your own little digital crypto wallet wherein you actually control the funds entirely as opposed to hosting them on a big centralized exchange like coinbase I'm going to keep it very simple for the purposes of this video in order to get a phantom wallet all you have to do is is literally just go Google Phantom wallet you're going to be able to go to their site add it to Chrome it's very simple you just add the extension you're going to go to create a new wallet you're going to go to create a seed phrase wallet you don't have to use your email and when you make this Phantom wallet it's going to give you something called a seed phrase now you can think of this seed phrase as basically a string of 12 random words that you can use anywhere to recover access to this wallet you can use it to recover it on your phone if you download the Phantom mobile app you can recover it on any computer anywhere in the world it's literally the keys to your wallet if you lose your seed phase and lose access to your wallet you will never be able to get in again and if anyone gets access to it they can get full access to your wallet and all of the funds in it so be extremely careful with the seed phrase never write it down on your computer or anything backed up to the cloud at minimum put it on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere safe better yet put it in a safe better yet etch it into something that is not flammable and that will not be destroyed by water it's very important it's like the keys to your bank and there's nobody you can call to get access back if you lose this I sorry I just want you to understand this now in order to get one step closer to actually being able to trade mem coins you're going to have to send your salana from moonshot to this Phantom wallet in order to do that you're going to go to the salana address at the very top here you're going to click this to copy that address now in order to send that salana from moot all you're going to do is go to send you're going to input the amount of salana that you want to send to Phantom you're going to swipe to start you're going to click this little person logo to switch it to a wallet logo and then you're going to paste in that exact same salana address that you just copied from your Phantom I'm going to go ahead and swipe to send right now and here in just a second you will see it populate on my Phantom wallet okay so it's officially sent and you'll see it come through right now there it is now we have it on Phantom now guys you might be watching this noticing that you can trade some meme coins directly on moonshot which is great but the selection on moonshot is going to be pretty limited coins have to actually get listed on there and by sending it to your Phantom you unlock the ability to trade literally any coin as soon as it is created if you're wondering how I just directly pasted it from my laptop to the app on my phone that's because I have everything back up to iCloud and I can copy and paste directly from my laptop to my phone if you can't do that you can either write it down and then write it in or you can just download the Phantom app directly on your phone so that you can just copy and paste it directly from your phone it's super easy now to continue getting set up the next platform that we're going to need to get is one called Photon I'll leave a link Down Below in the description to go sign up for this tool it is simply the best and fastest mem coin trading tool and what everybody on the market is using to trade right now if you're not using Photon honestly you're just losing so you're going to go to that link and then you're simply going to come click the connect wallet button now if you're doing all this on Phantom mobile instead of on desktop like I'm showing you it's very simple I'll put the recording on screen right now all you're going to have to do is open up the Phantom app go over to the internet Tab you're going to copy the link to Photon that you see in the description of this video and you're going to paste it into the URL bar on the Phantom app and whenever you open it in the Phantom app like that you're going to see that same type a connect wallet button and be able to do the same thing that I'm doing on desktop right now for the rest of this video I am going to show it on desktop you can do all the same stuff on your phone so once you've connected your wallet to Photon you're going to go ahead and generate a private key make sure that you save this because you're going to be able to use this to recover this wallet anywhere and after that all that you're going to have to do is deposit that salana into Photon and you can start trading to do that all you're going to do is go to the wallet management button you're going to go to deposit you're going to enter in the amount of soul that you want to deposit in this wallet I have. 39 Soul so I'll go ahead and send 38 soul in to deposit I'll enter that number I will click deposit I will click confirm on my wallet that transaction will send it'll take just a second and in just a moment you'll see that this salana has landed in my Photon okay great now I have it in here and now I can go trade now before I continue guys if any of this is confusing bear in mind that inside my private Community Champs only we have extremely detailed guides for all this a full-time team to help you get onboarded with as much detail as you need and if you find any of this stuff challenging to do on your own you can just hop in our community and we help you get fully set up with that said the next thing that we need to go over is the settings that you need to apply to make sure that you are able to successfully and safely trade on photon so I'll go to settings here and I'll walk you through this here you're going to see S1 S2 and S3 these are basically just presets for your settings that you can click through but for all intents and purposes if you're new you really only need one of the first thing that you're going to see on your screen here is slippage this basically means the percent price difference that you are willing to accept whenever you click buy or click sell so if I had this set to 20% that means that if I click Buy on something when it is at 10 cents I would be okay with that buy going through all the way at 12 cents or all the way at 8 cents I personally like to keep my slippage very low at 2% I don't want my transaction to vary almost at all from the price at which I actually want to buy this asset now below this is a setting called Mev protection if you're using higher slippage I would recommend you have Mev protection on if you're using very low slippage you can get away with having Mev protection off although sometimes your transactions just won't go through and you're going to have to try multiple times now very quickly if you don't know what a Mev bot is or what MF protection is it requires a slight understanding of how blockchains work in general so when you are transacting on salana I.E you're buying and selling any meme coin that is built on top of the salana blockchain you are paying what is called a priority fee and a transaction fee I.E if I go buy some random memec coin on salana I am paying a small amount of salana in order to make that transaction go through and the more fee that I pay the faster that transaction goes and to put it very simply what a Mev bot is doing is seeing your transaction as soon as you start it even though it only takes a couple seconds it is buying the same coin that you were trying to buy even faster than you by applying a very high priority and transaction fee it is pushing the price up so you end up buying the asset way higher than you wanted it to and then immediately dumping on you and what ends up happening is this I'll just use a random Char as an example you would try and buy it right here where my mouse is you'd start your transaction the Mev bot would push the price up all the way up to here you would end up getting a buy at $1.70 and then it would immediately sell it back down to $160 so basically what would happen is that you would have just immediately lost money bought it for more expensive than it actually is and gotten farmed by this bot however if your slippage is set very low you can actually keep your smart MTH protection on fast but if you set this slippage higher like some more advanced traders who are trading really volatile assets do you're going to want to have this Smart M protection on for the purpose of my settings and how I like to trade you can keep it on Fast up next is your priority fee now I mentioned earlier that anytime you make a transaction on the salana blockchain you're paying a transaction fee and a priority fee and the priority fee is basically just an extra little bit of salana that you pay to make your transaction go even faster faster than other people that are also transacting at the same time now if we go look at the average priority fees being run on salana over the past 24 hours you can see that it usually hovers pretty low around 0.001 but in some cases Spikes all the way almost to 0.01 so I'm always going to keep my priority fee at 0.01 without over complicating this this basically means that I always know that I'm paying a higher than average priority fee it's still a very small amount of soul but it's going to make sure that my transactions go through fast and then on the bribery fee I'm just going to go ahead and Di that up to 0.003 just to try and incentivize those transactions to go even faster because speed is the name of the game now these presets down here are simply the amount of salana that you want to be able to press what's called quick buy buttons for I.E just little fast buttons on photon to automatically adjust how much salana you want to buy this is going to be totally up to preference now for me I'm always going to have a one Salon button a two salana button I have a five salana button a 10 and then I have a 20 and a 50 which I don't use very often that's obviously bigger size now the next part of this tool where you're going to need to get your settings right and familiarize yourself is going to be the meme M scope tab now I've already made an entire other video explaining what this is what pump fun is the site on which all these tokens are launching what it means for them to graduate and migrate over to radium and I'll link that video down below if you haven't watched that as well so I'm going to assume that you know what meme coins are and what pump fun is but this is the tab on photon where you're going to be able to watch all those freshly launched tokens see which ones get enough buys to then migrate over to radium and there are quick buy buttons that you can use to ape into these tokens immediately as soon as you see them so I'm I'm going to recommend that you go ahead and set that to whatever amount of money you are literally completely okay with going to zero and losing because 99% of tokens don't even graduate from pump fund meaning they don't even get to a $100,000 market cap and then most of them go to zero anyway so this is really kind of actually this isn't even like playing roulette this is like playing roulette if the odds were rigged 99.9% against you and there are much smarter ways to trade that I talk about on this channel all the time and of course that we talk about inside Champs only with that said if you do want to play this game there are a few filters I would recommend that you apply I like to apply at least 15% pump progress as well as at least 15 holders I like to filter my snipers to less than one because most tokens that get sniped just ends up going to zero and if you do that you're going to get a little bit better mix of tokens to watch here instead of just like literally dead tokens okay so now we've got you set up we've explained how to buy salana how to get it onto a phantom wallet how to get that onto Photon the best meme coin trading tool and what settings you need to apply to make sure that you can successfully trade but how do you go find coins and more important importantly does all of this stuff even work well first things first if you're new here I would never try and go it alone I don't care if you join my community or someone else's crypto especially mem coins are extremely risky this is not a get-rich quick scheme or a free money glitch and you need a community of season Traders around you who have been through multiple Crypt bll markets not only to give you the best information and help you find winning tokens but also to keep you from getting rugged or scammed or just flat losing all of your money by being stupid and not knowing what you're doing because again guys that is what happens to 99% of people who join the crypto space it is not easy and like I said earlier if you do want to jump in my community with me and my entire team that is dedicated to educating people on how to actually succeed in this space you can join Champs only at the link in the description below we have not only an extremely active and dedicated community of Traders uplifting one another and winning every single day but we have a full-time team dedicated to scanning this Market find pics and teaching all of our members the skills that they need to do the same thing we also offer a full Suite of tools that you'll need to be successful in this space aren't members can input simple commands to analyze wallets scan for rugs check Twitter metrics find new coins we're adding in a Twitter scanner and a wallet tracker as we speak just trying to put everything you can need in one place which is probably why our best members are able to produce wins like these every single week with that said I'm just going to go find and grab a previous winning trade from my own Photon account break down how I took it why I took it and show show you how these tool settings help me succeed now I just went and grabbed a random trade so this is actually pretty old from quite a while ago but it's actually a great example to show you guys that you always need to be taking profits because as you can see most of these coins end up going back to zero like this isn't some future of Finance intelligent investing thing you're trying to extract money get in and get out now I've made countless videos on this channel about meme coins the attention economy and what it means to figure out how to bet early on Meme coins you can check out the other videos on my channel cuz I'm not going to give a full description of how this entire ecosystem works in this video but like I always say successful meme coin trade is just successfully betting on future attention a token named after a meme or an individual or any internet Trend that you think is going to continue getting more and more attention is a winning token now this token was called marude which is basically just a stupid little meme that was based around somebody who has become very popular in the crypto space this year called Morad now Morad is a character who has grown to massive prominence on crypto Twitter in the past 6 months or so gotten very famous for basically Shilling meme coin in a really intelligent sounding way he posts these big lists and at the time that I bought this token called marude which is basically just like a play on Morad or basically just trying to like piggyback off the attention that he was getting I felt like he was rising to massive massive prominence and this was a longer term trade this was over like a week now if you go look back at this trade whenever I bought it I have the 1 hour chart pulled up right now it looks like it was like a terrible trade for the first two days I was way underwater on it it looked like the coin was literally just dying and it looked like a a bad trade you can see where all my buys are and then you can we started getting these massive candles and I specifically remember I went back and checked my wallet randomly on photon a few days later because I had been busy and was like oh my God this trade is actually cooking and like I always say in these video guys I'm taking profits all the way along the way could I have made more money if I held all of this and sold it all the way at the top yeah is that realistic 99% of the time absolutely not I'm always taking profits around the way now to stress the importance of the tools that I told you about earlier I'll look at one of these cells right I have it open on the F minute chart right now now it's not marked on this chart but looking at this five minute candle you can see that in the same 5 minutes it was as high as 00124 cents and went all the way down to as low as1002 cents so almost a 20% price difference if I had not had either my slippage low like I showed you earlier or MTH protection on I could have easily gotten this cell front run by a Mev bot and gotten that cell going through all the way down at 10 cents or perhaps even lower and this Wick right here might have been caused by somebody getting Mev and it might not seem like a big deal to lose 10 or 20% on your cells by getting Mev but if it happens every time you're selling it ends up being a big deal now if I scroll through this you can see that I actually pretty successfully sold the very top of this twice and then ended up selling the rest of my bag later down here once I realized this trade was probably dead so I didn't perfectly exit this trade but again guys close to $10,000 off of buying a stupid little meme coin named after a popular influencer not bad and if I didn't have my settings attuned how I told you earlier I could have probably easily made a th000 less dollars on this trade so now we've shown you how to buy salana we've shown you how to get in the game get that salana to Phantom get it into Photon and set all the settings up right I've shown you an example trade and for the last part of this video if you're still watching I want to send you off with three action steps to go and start successfully trading step one is to get your mindset right this is not going to be free infinite money it is very easy to lose especially if you don't have access to the right information and you're going to have to be willing to learn willing to experiment and overall have an open mind about this stuff without expecting to be spoonfed free information because that's just not how the game works two before you leave this video actually take the time to set up the tools that I just showed you actually get a phantom wallet actually transfer that into Photon and take the initial action step of getting set up because if you click on this video and you don't do all of that stuff you're probably going to end up letting it slip never even doing it and then sometime in the next year or two you're going to have let the entire Bull Run pass you by you're going to finally end up actually taking action and you're going to end up buying close to the top of this Market from smarter people who had the discipline and the wherewithal to get in before you you're going to hold your crypto back down to zero you're going to call this entire industry a scam even though I told you now that you need to be paying attention and it's not going to be a good time you've been warned and third take the time to get access to the right info as a YouTuber I am telling you transparently that no matter how many YouTube videos that you watch of how to buy this how to trade that next top 10 coins it's not going to be enough that's why I run my own educational and trading community so if you've taken the time to watch all the way through this video I would recommend that you go down below in the description and give us a shot you can just go read our reviews to see how much value we provide and either way be sure you drop a sub on the channel for more time sensitive content because we are not slowing down anytime soon love you guys peace",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFYzslmMFSQ,"['Dogecoin', 'Safe', 'JUST', 'Scroll',

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #reserverights #rsr #crypto","Reserve rights or the rsr token is on a massive run it's climbing from one high to the next the question is what's fueling all of this Reserve rights is definitely riding the real world asset narrative a lot of real world asset tokens are currently going up but who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the data most people are not considering today we are up by 36% this week we more than doubled this month we almost tripled but have a look at the very long term at one point we were at 10 cents now we are at one tenth of that the recent rally is just a blip in the long term now why did the price crash that much this year is partially the answer this is the market cap not the price so the market cap is almost at half of the all-time high the price of course isn't and the reason for that is token inflation there are now way more rsr tokens floating compared to 3 years ago now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just selling you the marketing Jaz on the website we want to know the data most people aren't considering the data that actually drives Demand versus Supply let's have a look at Supply there were a few funding rounds 3 million in 2019 to May in 2018 an Ico of 360k Etc have a look the people that participated in those funding rounds had very nice rois but again let's have a look at the Delta between the market cap and the price what we've got over here is the circulating Supply chart by misari doio and there is a slight inaccuracy here there was never 100 B billion circulating we pretty much started at 3.7 billion and then more than 10x in the supply now we are at 50 billion the maximum is 100 billion here's the same chart directly by looking at the blockchain so I can confirm we can check out those minting events over time and we are currently at those 50 billion so let's have a look at the details in the documentation Reserve rights rsr has a fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens 50.6 billion are in circulation 49 .4 billions belong to slow and slower wallets so slow wallet is controlled by the project team the slower wallet is also in the hands of Affiliated projects so half of the supply pretty much gets released over time in a slow manner or in a slower manner to the people that contribute to the ecosystem now is that good is that bad I'm not sure usually you've got way more circulating Supply after project has been around for such a long time there is token inflation to come and if demand doesn't grow as quickly as a supply then of course the price has to come down so the people that currently work on the project have to create enough demand now here's one reason why Reserve rights is going up it's the real world asset narrative real world assets increased by almost 70% in the last s days only AI agents and Cat themed coins could outperform this all the other categories did worse and the good thing about Reserve is that it's still active look at the GitHub repository this is the place where programmers develop and submit their code changes and there had been an update just 4 hours ago another one 5 hours 6 hours ago yesterday Etc so there is real programming activity happening let's have a look at defi Lama this is the place where we can see how much capital is locked up in various decentralized Finance protocols and the total value locked for Reserve is at all-time highs it's currently at roughly 50 million the market cap is roughly at 10 times the size so 500 million market cap in an ecosystem where where the largest player is at 1.3 billion so this can give us a hint how much potential upside there might be if Reserve riots was to make another 3x from here 3x in outperformance not just in US Dollars then it would be the largest real world asset token in all of crypto now let's have a look at who's buying and who's selling here let's look at the onchain data I created a tool that distinguishes retail wallets from the whale Wallets on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 100,000 rsr tokens that the current price that's roughly $11,000 that's what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now a minimum holding of $10,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 so you go a 10x from each of those charts those are very long-term charts they start in January of 2022 there is long-term accumulation across the board the Wales aren't buying that much anymore in the last 2 years now again compare this this is the number of investors while this is the price development all of that down move movement is an expanding token Supply it's the team getting money out of the system it's not the investors that have left the asset now what happened in the last month where the price went up by a 3X here the same kind of charts with the exact same thresholds but only for the last 30 days the number of retail investors grew by roughly 6% medium-sized retail grew marginally less than 1% and the number of Wales declined slightly so this rally cannot be 100% explained by just retail Demand right why would the price 3x when the number of investors isn't growing that much but let's have a look at relative long-term performance if we invest in an altcoin we want to see outperformance over a Bitcoin and ethereum right otherwise we can simply just buy Bitcoin ride the crypto waves why get into so much risk of a small altcoin if we don't see outperformance and so let's have a look at this chart this shows rsr relative to ethereum so it's not the US doll price it's the ethereum denominated price and Ely this was a very long-term very constant underperformance of 98% but recently we are seeing the rally so the underperformance now is only 95 if we just look at that rally then the outperformance is a bit over 200% now here's something I don't like about rsr have a look at this this is still 50% of the entire Supply in a single wallet this is what goes to the team at some point or at least to Associated project then we've got the reserve and we've got also binance here binance there another binance wallet over here an okx wallet over here a Qin wallet over here but it's basically binance that owns most of the liquid Supply and that's then also what we can see in the trading volume 40% of the spot trading volume in the last 24 hours happened on binance the value of 140% of the market cap got traded on the Perpetual Futures so on the bets again on binance so binance or at least the Wales on binance have a massive price impact here and this unfortunately makes a lot of block analytics very hard because centralized exchanges are black boxes they don't show us the number of whales or the number of retail investors can this really last longer yes of course it can but if you ask me I personally prefer tokens where I can see the data where I can actually see if there is long-term adoption by people where it can be 100% safe that that is not just manipulation by one or two players if it's your first

#mog #crypto","this is not the first video on mock coin on this channel I published four videos reaching all the way back to 7 months ago in this video I want to share the viewer statistics of those videos is mckoin actually popular let's also look at onchan analytics try to find out how much longer the current R can potentially last so here's the very first video on mcoin it was published on the 6th of March 2024 and since then we went up by roughly 85% now here's the performance of that first video it outperformed your typical video it took some time to take off but still the blue line is that mock video the gray area is a typical video here's the second video it performed pretty much average the third video outperformed again and the fourth video outperformed massively so it appears as if interest in mck coin is growing over time now let's see if you can confirm this with onchain data most of trading of mock coin still happens on chain on Unis swap the token is also available on bybit gate.io Q coin and Mexi but I don't believe price Discovery happens there it seems like most trading happens on chain and so when we look at the ethereum chain mock coin is the second largest in terms of liquidity among the trending tokens there's $15.4 Million worth of value in that liquidity pool only Pepe is larger there are 33,000 holders but not all of those holders are created equal we're going to look at this in a second this video is sponsored by the premium membership I never take take any money from any crypto project I never take any affiliate links from centralized exchanges I never pump and dump coins instead I offer valuable tutorials in the premium membership feel free to check it out and what I want to start off with is the performance in the last month so mck coin went up by almost 70% and here's the holder development over that month now on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 600 million mock coins at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the to toen for the chart in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's now $110,000 worth of the token on the right we have a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the token so small retail accumulates mediumsized retail accumulates as well the whales simply stand still they might slightly buy but barely and so it seems like pretty much all of that rally is due to retail investors now we can also zoom out a little bit let's have a look at the alltime charts again retail accumulates but it seems like this is recently accelerating for the last Wales we can't necessarily say this for certain and so mcoin has been around for a while so most days we actually see more return users than new users trading the token ideally you want to be in a token where there's a growing investor base where on some days you might even see more new users than returning users that's not the case for mcoin unfortunately we also don't really see how the trading volume relatively speaking changes as in the new users pretty much constantly have around 24% or so of trading volume and so it appears as if mock coin is now becoming one of the conservative meme coins it's got a market cap of 660 million being very close to SPX 6900 but have a look at the volatility in the last week mcoin only moved by 133% SPX 6900 moved by 209% Nero moved by 100% so yes mcoin is the second largest token on ethereum according to liquidity but when we look at the trading volume it's only at number eight even Harry Potter Obama Sonic Eno is traded more and that's got less than half of the market cap and of course now all is are on Nero and on SPX 6900 so I'm not sure if it makes sense to get that heavy into mock coin anymore when trading meme coins we already take on quite a lot of risk and that risk needs to be compensated with a lot of upside but currently the ice are not necessarily on Mock and it's already relatively expensive the nice thing of course is that retail accumulation is very constant the question is will whales dump on retail they sometimes do we sometimes get our 50% crashes currently they seem to be rather holding back if it's your

meme coin now let's have a look at the data most people aren't looking at to figure out how long this rally could potentially last here is that rally we are up 35% today alone we almost three xed this week we more than five xed this month but here's the roller coaster I was talking about we had a lot of pumps subsequent dumps now we're in a pump again are we going to dump and if yes when now there was a clear reason for those prior dumps and that was token inflation more and more tokens hit the market expanding the supply and that Supply expansion leads to potentially depressed prices because early investors the early backers the team they might have sold during those prior dumps but here's what's nice about the blockchain everything is transparent and so now we are pretty close to the maximum circulating Supply already 83% are circulating so there's not going to be a lot of new tokens hitting the market and so you can tell already from the beginning of this video that I'm not a YouTuber that just runs you through the website sells you the marketing Jazz Etc we are going to look at the things most people are not looking at and one of those things is simply who is buying is this small retail or is this the Wales I've built a tool that counts the number of wallets over time on the left we see the number of wallets that hold at least three billion my lady tokens so that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token there are 3,200 such wallets for the middle chart we go in order of magnitude up so that's now $10,000 worth of the token there are 600 such Wallets on chain on the right side we go to the Wales another 10x that's now $100,000 worth of the token there's 141 Wales you can see that over those very long-term charts that start in May of 2023 that there hasn't been too much accumulation actually an initial run but then not much happened so this chart here shows the same time Horizon as this chart and this is the price development right we pumped and dumped we pumped and dumped and now we are pumping again but we don't necessarily see this in the number of holders isn't that interesting let's have a look at just this month where we more than five xed so this is the price development and this is the development of holders over time not much change for the whales maybe an increase of 10% or so in the number of medium-sized wallets an increase again of roughly 10% by retail so a 10% increase in the number of investors doesn't necessarily justify that much of a price increase why would the price more than 5x when the number of investors barely changes I believe I know the answer let's simply just look at the token distribution so check this out who holds most ladies tokens the largest holder is crypto.com the second largest is bybit the third largest is crypto.com again we've got two unlabored wallets but we could find this out probably that's also centralized exchanges then we've got gate.io we've also got qoin so really this token is the playball of the centralized exchanges I do not believe that those price movements are organic movements otherwise we would see this on chain as well I believe that a lot of those centralized exchanges have those ladies tokens actually on the book and they want to create some fuss they want to create some attention through those price swings to potentially sell those tokens off that's I think what happens with those pumps and dumps it's the centralized exchanges that are moving the price it's not the people on chain right the number of investors is barely changing and so here's the balance development of crypto.com this appears like vesting or unlocks to me so maybe crypto.com simply got some tokens allocated here is the buybit wallet also has quite a bit of a balance but note how the balance increase here right that happened in December of last year there's very little change recently but a lot of the price development happened recently is this a coincidence I don't think so here's the balance development of the other crypto.com wallet maybe one of those wallet is actually custody for customers and that other wallet is Market making right the tokens that are on the books here is the gate IO wallet and here is qoin again a lot of accumulation in December one could get the impression that maybe those companies talk to one another right they don't want to dump each other they simply just want to extract maximum value from retail now here's another data point this is the trading volume on the spot Market again it's dominated by the centralized exchanges no surprise over here and here are the Perpetual Futures so those centralized exchanges also offer bets on the price so on the one hand you hold a lot of the supply on the other hand you also offer bets on the price so it's pretty much like you're the sports betting house you have paid the referee and then you offer people to bet on the price so if a lot of people are betting on Rising prices they might be dumping the price and vice versa I don't have a crystal ball either I don't know where this price will be going but I do believe there is quite a bit of manipulation there and the people that want to manipulate this up could do this further but still I prefer price Ries that are very much organically driven not just by a few key players if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I

again it's already very painful just watching the presidential debate between Biden and Trump seeing now even an assassination attempt on Trump is just the cherry on top now in this video I don't want to talk about the implications on Democracy Etc this is in the end a crypto Channel I want to talk about what kind of impact this had on the M token because here's the thing with global events Like This Global News create attention and attent turns into purchases of related tokens as we have seen with ma the price went from $6 all the way to above $10 in a matter of a few minutes but now we are coming back down could the price potentially continue to rise from here given that the chances are pretty high that Trump will win this election I want to look at onchain metrics I want to look at the buyers and sellers so let's start off with the balance that's been held by Mex C that's the main centralized exchange of MAA which holds currently 3.3% of the token here's the balance development over time Mech C is accumulating potentially because customers simply demand for the token right they want to buy the token on the centralized exchange and then the centralized exchange goes on chain to actually do the purchases and so we are at an all-time high in the Mexi Holdings and the tension on MAA is large especially r relative to the liquidity on chain because have a look at this this is the ethereum chain and the Trump token is the 17th largest token on chain it's got 9 million worth of liquidity half of that is W ethereum the other half is the Trump token so there's currently 590,000 tokens on chain in that pool on Unis swap Maxi holds roughly three times of that now when I looked at the onchain holder development when I looked at the buyers and sellers detail but also the whales I noticed something that is a bit off that is a bit concerning at the first glance everything looks very nice as in the number of retail investors is growing over time mediumsized retail as well and whales as well so what we see here on the left is the number of wallets that hold at least 100 ma tokens so that's $770 worth of the token in the middle we've got a 10x in minimum holding so that's at least $7,700 worth of the token and on the right we've got $77,000 worth of the token so it's always a 10x from one another the Wales have stopped purchasing since the middle of February of this year but the number of Wales is actually not going down it's simply just flat but since February of this year the number of retail wallets grew by almost 3x so it's really a retail driven rally however here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month and here is what's concerning the number of whale investors didn't really change much medium-sized retail grew by roughly 10% and small retail grew by roughly 20% so one would expect that in the last month this is where those charts start that in the last month the price should have gone up there was mainly adoption right there was more and more people jumping on the token but in the last month the price unfortunately went down by 37% so Mexi is accumulating small retail is accumulating as well the number of whale wallets is pretty much stagnant where does all this selling pressure come from I do not have an answer unfortunately I do not know who's selling here but there's some kind of selling happening that's not that visible on chain I thought maybe it's leverage maybe it's manipulation via derivatives via Perpetual Futures but there's also very little trading volume on those Perpetual Futures right there's no action here either and so because of that question mark because I don't know why the price went down in the last month while Bitcoin went in aggregate almost flat right it was only a loss of 5% while at the same time we see how the investor base is growing because I can't explain this poor performance I personally have to stay away unfortunately I'm not going to buy ma but if you've got an idea why the price performed so poorly and why it might not in the future where the selling pressure was coming from and why this might stop then please please let me know I want to see the data that shows what's actually going on I'm really looking forward to any kind of comment that might reveal what this puzzle is all about if you've got telegram I'm also very much looking forward to discussing this

#crypto","just a chill guy did more than just chilling it went up by more than 1,000% this week alone the question is can this really last longer let's have a look at some fundamentals let's have a look at the onchain data who's buying who's selling here let's look beyond the price action to figure out if this is still a good investment now here are the top meme coins ordered by the performance in the last week and at number one we've got just a chill guy with 1,1 190% return now I publish videos on meme coins regularly on this channel and of course I also discussed just a chill guy quite early so here's that video published roughly a week ago it outperformed the average video it still gets traffic and that's why I do an update that video was published when we were still at 20 cents since then we went up by 145% but how much higher can we go let's do the thing I like to do with pretty much any video on this channel let's look at the onchain data let's see who's buying and selling here on the left side we see the number of firsttime traders in purple and the number of recurring traders in Orange and ideally we want to see more firsttime Traders than recurring Traders on any given day now we are seeing somewhat of a Slowdown still the number of first-time Traders is exceeding number of recurring Traders but there is a Slowdown in activity we also see that slowdown on the right that's the number of token transactions so the first time Traders peaked on the 20th of November the number of token transactions peaked one day after that on the 21st of November now I I think it's always important to figure out who's actually driving the price action right now is a small retail that's purchasing more and more tokens are there thousands of new people getting in or are there a few whales that have very Deep Pockets that buy up everything now when it's the letter the question is who are those whales right who are those Deep Pockets that are buying up is this just private investors or is this potentially centralized exchanges that use the tokens for Market making now here's the trading volume over time on the left side just in US Dollars on the right side normalized to 100% per day and now we can also segment the different wallet cohorts so again we see our peak in attention on the 21st of November but what is interesting is how recently especially today we see a lot of whales buying the token now whales are wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token large retail is from 10,000 to 100 medium is from 1,000 to 10,000 and small is everything below $1,000 worth of the token and so it's interesting how the whales are buying and it's interesting how over time small retail tends to make up less and less of trading volume the number of holders didn't change much we stabilized on a high level that's true for small retail medium-size retail but also for the large Wales and here for those charts the cut offs are done slightly differently so now we're not looking at us do cut offs but at number of token cut offs so it's 2,000 tokens on the left 20,000 tokens in the middle and 200,000 tokens on the right so at the current price it's rough $1,000 $10,000 $100,000 worth of the token and so it appears as if the very large wallets the whales are now buying in their growth is the strongest in the last days it went from 150 million to more than 300 million in a matter of a few days small retail increased their holding only by roughly 10 to 20% and so who are those whales I believe it's centralized exchangers I believe it's market makers so we've got the new listing of chill guy on bybit and even though we still see most trading volume happening on chain on radium we now also see a lot of trading volume happening through the Perpetual Futures Market on bybit on Maxi on bitg and so this is longterm how the game is probably going to play out as there is a lot of volatility in the price those derivative Futures make a lot of money but at the same time if at some point the majority of people are rather bearish on the token then the token might shoot up even further so usually what happens is the centralized exchangers buy more and more of the token and once they've got the token they tend to manipulat the price very aggressively up and down and they try to induce derivative trading from these movements so what's happening is that on the one side they can influence the price with all of that holding but on the other side they also offer bets on the price it's kind of like if you were to offer Sports bet on a football match at the same time you also bought the referee right you can say how the game will end but at the same time you offer bets on that game and that's how you make money as a centralized exchange with those derivative Futures but let's park this all aside let's have a look at how much upside there is now for chill guy again in the last week we made more than 1,000% return so that's a 13x over here currently the market cap is at 524 million so before that rally started chill guys market cap was only at 40 million so probably the next rocket is not necessarily in the hundreds of millions it's rather in the tens of millions just have a look at all of those other outperformers right their market caps is isn't huge and have a look at the larger market caps right this is all the pump. fun ecosystem yes just a chill guy is very very high with its return in the last 7 days but most of those larger caps actually did not do that well now the crypto Market as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly and I like to look at the stable coin market cap to determine whether or not we're currently in a bull market or in a bare market and that is the chart we see over here sometimes we see the stable coin market cap going up sometimes we see it going down and the reason why I like this chart so much is because it has very little volatility right it doesn't go tically up and down like the Bitcoin price or like the Dogecoin price it has very clear Trends what happened over here was the defi collapse of the anchor protocol right so this is when Terra Luna went bust this is when the US stable coin depack this is when a lot of people withdrew money from crypto it started a whole Bare market and during that bare Market Bitcoin went from 69k all the way down to 16k and also after F TX collapsed during that bare Market since October of last year we see an expansion of the stablecoin market cap again and that expansion is recently accelerating now the reason why this chart is so useful is not just because we can see clearly the trend where currently the crypto Market is at what's also nice about it is that we can deterministically say that currently money is flowing into crypto as in traditional Finance the traditional Finance world is moving Fiat into the crypto space because whenever this is going up this means that you send for example your US dollars to binance and binance then sends this to a custodian of stable coins let's say tether tether then takes custody of your money right it puts it in some kind of bank account or in some kind of bonds and then mince the tokens on the blockchain and we can see the tether minting here in this chart and so the exact opposite happens when this is going down this is when you withdraw your fiat currency from binance and so I think there's roughly 177 billion reasons to believe that the price of crypto is likely going to continue to rise from here all of crypto and so this is what I mean with all of crypto right crypto is highly correlated to one another when Bitcoin goes up then all the altcoins go up as well but they don't go up to the same degree here are the top 100 alt coins in the last 7 Days ordered by their performance and the best performer was Stella with a bit over 100% but have a look at this this is the best performing meme coins in the last 7 days and we've got chill gu with more than 3,000% in the last 7 days we talked about CH guy several times on this channel but we also talked about the goat token several times on this channel when it was still very very cheap now goat is the largest of the meme coins on the Solana blockchain that had been launched with pump. fun so pump. fun is the Launchpad of meme coins on Solana there's a lot of trading happening over there and goat has the largest market cap now I made a video on Goat when it was still at 24 cents that was on the 16th of October subsequently the price went up by more than 500% now recently it came down again a bit and so I tried to find tokens that currently have positive momentum that still have a lot of upside potential tokens that can still do the 345 xes that are probably not possible anymore with the larger tokens so if you're interested in being early in those kind of bets then feel fre you to subscribe to this channel right I publish videos regularly here now how did I find out about the go token for example that early the answer is wallet tracking have a look at this influencer Kyle Chessie bought the gold token already at 14 cents so that was over here subsequently the price went up by more than 800% now what is wallet tracking the blockchain is completely transparent right we can see who's buying who's selling the only difficult part is to find out what are the wallets that are important who owns what kind of wallets what kind of wallets actually make money and so here is Kyle chesse he's got more than 130,000 subscribers he's the the person that bought gold early and so through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets we always get a signal when he's buying or selling something I have a look at this alert from today bankless bought the clanker token for $53 since then the price went up by 57% again that's in a matter of a few hours and have a look at this below right this is the onchain analytics that one of our moderators performed on The Token here's the bankless channel they've got almost a quarter of a million subscribers and of course when they talk about a token this generates a lot of attention and attention then means purchases and purchases mean a rising price we only have two of Bank L's wallets but we try to find more again we use onchain analytics and we have our people in the chats that use various methods to find wallets of people that move markets I want to share one more trade and it's probably the most impressive of the trades because it turns a micro cap into a pretty large pump and dump this was on November 23rd the martini guy bought the moon token on pump fun right we already talked about pump. fun and he did this at a price of 412 this is how that developed once it got traded on radium it R up by more than 1,000% now it's at 4 34 so even after the dump we are still up by roughly 3x that's how early those kind of signals are here is the martini guy he he's got 150,000 subscribers roughly and here are the wallets that we Track by this guy 12 in total we now have exactly 500 wallets in our tracking so it's not just the three influencers that I just mentioned we've got way more and so this is I believe the real way to make money in crypto right you want to know things that most people don't know how else can you buy lower than others and sell higher than others if you don't have a market Edge if you don't know more than others it's better to be very closely to the people that buy early and then potentially sell when all the masses come and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic it is eight videos in total it's about how to find influencer wallets it's how to set up the tracking for the influencer wallets and it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the bitcoin.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification it's also about the back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium and so once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell what are the current onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individ all coins as well so feel for you to check it out it's currently $125 per month the price will increase next week so you can lock in still this old price and keep that all price there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you do not like premium just message me within the first week we and I refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it still make sense to buy the chill guide token maybe there is still positive momentum and there is accumulation by the centralized exchanges that being said I do believe that most upside is not necessarily in the larger meme coins or in the larger alt coins in general I believe the real best risk versus reward is in the smaller tokens especially when we've got a market Edge especially if we know more than the rest of the market if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I publish you secondly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

the Wales are buying now how do I know this I'm looking at onchain data most people aren't considering because this is how the game is played it's player versus player the ones that are early make the money the ones that are late are the exit liquidity that get dumped on having more data than most others is an edge to beat the market and so let's have a look at that data let's have a look at what small retailers doing versus what the Wales are doing so this is py right now we are up 58% today we are now at 36 C this week we more than doubled and since listing on coin market cap at the end of January on this year we are up more than 4X but that didn't happen without pain we did see our massive declines in between of more than 50% so you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not going to go through the marketing jazz on the website Etc if you want to make money with me coins we need to have an edge and the website is not a source of alpha neither is the Twitter of course but some people do some analytics on Twitter check how fast the followers are growing check how many views there are on various posts but unfortunately that data can also be manipulated quite easily the trading data is much harder to manipulate because most of the trading of pky still happens on the centralized exchanges on radium directly on the Solana blockchain and the blockchain is transparent 27% of all of trading happened on radium directly on the Chain there is trading on Mexi on on biit and on htx as well but again most Trading still happens on radium this is very good this gives us transparency now the central question is always who is buying a token why is a token going up there's basically two explanations the first explanation is that a lot of new retail investors go into a token maybe because it had been promoted maybe because there's a new development so it's broad retail adoption that's the first explanation the second explanation for a price value like this is that the whales are buying so the Deep Pockets this could be because either they want to short-term manipulate the price or because they think something might be coming up maybe a listing on more centralized exchanges on average the larger wallets tend to make the better calls because crypto is both a game of luck and skill but the more skill you have the more Capital will concentrate towards you so the skilled people made better calls in the past they've got larger wallets so should be following what they are doing now let's have a look at this chart this shows the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders per day for the py token and we see a massive influx of firsttime traders in the first two days we saw another influx of firsttime Traders on the 3rd of May but on all other days the recurring Traders outpaced the first time Traders let's have a look at that 3rd of May that was over here and then subsequently we had our nice rally now I said in the beginning of this video that I believe that the Wales are buying and here's why have a look at this this is the daily trading volume segregated by Trader segment small retail is all the wallets that have less than $11,000 worth of the Bony token mediumsized retail is all the wallets that have between ,000 and $10,000 worth of the token large retail is the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token now let's look at large retail alone a bigger and bigger fraction of trading volume is occupied by large retail and it has an all-time high today if you look at large retail plus medium-sized retail we can again see that there is somewhat of a peak today the day by the way isn't yet over so this will likely grow further to potentially an all-time high but there was also a peak on the 17th and 18th of April let's check the 17th and 18th of April that was over here here was the 17th here was the 18th so the smart money went in we were still relatively low at 10 cents and then on the 18 it grew all the way to 16 18 cents on the 19th we were at 18 cents so and the larger wallets buy this is a good sign now again we see the large wallets buying and of course no indicator is perfect and this could be a bad signal and this could be shter manipulation but I'm not so sure about this I actually believe that the 36 Cents are still comparatively low for pky we are now at a fully diluted market cap of 200 million and have a look at where py is in the grand scheme of things it's still smaller than coino it's smaller than Apu it's smaller than Brett of course there's a 2.5x roughly until we flip pcoin there is a 4X until we flip book of Meme and an 8X until we flip Bon I'm not saying that those kind of things will happen but it still gives us some kind of an idea of what the potential upside is I will continue to update the numbers I will continue to make follow up videos on py if you don't want to miss them feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a

Bonkers let's have a look at how sustainable that really is who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at fundamentals as well since launch the a itch token went up by more than 260% it's now currently at roughly 13 cents a lot of that performance happened in the last month or to be more precise even in the last week we more than doubled in the last s days alone now here's the big question how much upside potential is there when an altcoin is doubling within a single week only what's the market cap what are comparable market caps and what's the current momentum around buying and selling who's buying here AI tokens can get very large bit tensor has more than 3 billion in market cap solidos is at less than one tenth of that currently at 270 million roughly now the website's very fancy there's a lot of marketing jazz on here I'm not going to bore you with all those animations Etc but there are some interesting details around the the team one of the advisers here Mr Elan rahmanov he's the founder and CEO at chain GPT one of the leading AI projects and so chain DPT of course did also very well within one month it almost 3x and solos can attract quite some attention look at this this is the number of telegram users over time there aren't that many crypto project that grow their telegram audience that quickly now not everything about the itch token looks great for example the documentation the first thing that you see over there there is the token address the team seems to be really desperate for you to buy their token and the way things are phrased also look pretty much like written by cat GPT solidos aite Tech has meticulously crafted a token designed to align with the platform success incentivize a healthy ecosystem and Foster collaboration between token holders and IAS platform clients now I'm not sure if the toomics are that meticulously crafted because have a look at this this is the token allocation a lot of ownership by the team a lot of allocation just for marketing and if you ever see somebody just talking positive things about the token that might be because they got paid from the KO bucket the key opinion leader bucket I personally take never any money from any project ever but let's have a look at the vesting schedule over here let's have a look at how quick this actually unlocks an unlock of 4 million over here another unlock 4 million tomorrow another unlock 4 million The Day After Tomorrow 0.2% of total Supply unlocks every day and that goes to a variety of people so here's the thing with crypto right prices are determined by demand versus Supply we can already see that Supply does expand relatively quickly now the only way the price can go up is if demand expands faster and that can potentially happen if marketing for example is strong enough or people simply believe in the technology and so let's have a look at who's buying here is this this only stupid retail or is actually the smart money the people with very large wallets are they buying as well because this is how I fundamentally think about crypto right crypto is a game of luck and of skill and as you play this game for long enough money moves from the small retail to the smart people to the whales so the whales tend to do the better calls let's have a look at what the whales are doing here I build a tool to distinguish retail wallets from whale wallets and it's available for the premium members you can pluck in any token here so any token on ethereum but also token on the binance smart chain and you can look at that graph the link is down below it's the Bitcoin tray.com and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 AI Tech tokens so at the current price that's $136 that's small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail so that's now $11,300 on the right side we've got the whales that's now $113,000 worth of the token those charts show the last 30 days and that corresponds with this price development so we are seeing accumulation from all wallet cohorts small retail as well as the Wales they're all buying this is very positive so the rally is really broadly underpinned by people getting interested in the project it's not just manipulation by the whales or by centralized exchanges the only centralized exchanges that might have a word in this is HDX gate.io and mexc this is where I can buy this but there's no binance yet and binance tends to do a lot of price manipulation so I don't believe there's too much manipulation just yet here so it's very interesting right we've got a lot of growing Supply which would be bad but we've got demand that grows even faster thus the price is rising so I believe that the price is likely going to continue to rise for a while until we see the Reflection Point until we see that marketing isn't effective anymore at least not effective enough to offset the inflation and then we might see a permanent downtrend from that onwards but so far momentum is positive so far it might make sense to ride this wave I personally don't own any aitech tokens just yet I might buy after releasing this video but I never buy before I never front run you guys I might buy several hours afterwards though if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it

Michi Price, Michi Price Prediction, Michi longterm, Michi Tokenomics,  #michi #memecoin #crypto","Mei is one of the top performers in the mem coin space in the last month it's up more than 160% let's have a look at the onchain data to find out how much longer this really can last are the Wales potentially selling is their potential manipulation let's dive deeper so here we are we are currently at 27 cents and we are up 164% in the last month alone I'm not going to walk you through the website like other YouTubers this is not where we can get an edge we want to see the data most people do not consider so here's what's interesting about MIT among the trending tokens on Solana it's the most liquid one it's got a liquidity pool of 5.8 billion more than FR more than gigette more than mudang and by the way I made videos on all of those so feel free to check out prior videos on this channel and feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly but let's have a look at what's going on with all that liquidity on Twitter or on the xplatform we've got 31,000 followers on telegram we've got 10,000 subscribers and on chain we've got 34,000 holders so all of those numbers pretty much align the price development has pretty much been a roller coaster or some might call it a pump of more than 2,500 with a subsequent dump of more than 80% now let's see who dumped over here and I will also talk about how to time the market how to potentially buy over here on the 31st of August using onchain data now the nice thing about the Mei token is that most trading happens on chain so we can actually see where the price is Discovery happens 44% of trading volume happens directly on radium and only 3% happens on a centralized exchange Mex C and so let's dive into the data let's have a look at the number of retail investors versus whale investors so what we see on the left is the number of wallets with at least 1,000 Mii tokens at the current price that's a bit under $300 it grew very very quickly initially we still have growth but it slowed down somewhat for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now roughly $3,000 worth of the Tok we can see how the accumulation is a bit slower right the number of small retail investors roughly 3x during this accumulation the number of medium-sized retail only doubled on the right side we go another 10x so that's now $30,000 worth of the token here we see very little accumulation if at all we can go another 10x so $300,000 worth of the token zero accumulation and then on the very right we've got 3 million worth of the token of course there aren't too many such wallets but as per tendency what we can see is that the smaller the wallets the faster the accumulation so this seems to be a take over by retail now it's still fascinating thinking about how consistent the purchasing here was while the price action wasn't consistent whatsoever some large wallets have definitely sold here and so since Mitch is already around for quite a while we see that pretty much on any day the number of recurring investors is larger than the number of new investors so the new investors is in turquoise the number of recurring Traders is in Orange and each and every single day the orange bar is larger than the purple one for a newly launched token we sometimes see the opposite being the case which would be a good indication of the base growing and of course a growing investor base is always nice for the price to stay high unfortunately we do have some selling pressure here now let's go back to the interesting part of this video how can we time bottoms like this when the price action is so volatile how can we buy on on the 31st of August and then subsequently get our 165% return the answer lies in this chart now here is how this fundamentally Works meme coin trading is pretty much a game of attention when attention is low the price tends to be low when attention is high the price tends to be high so I want to gain more and more attention in order for the price to increase however if you want to pick bottoms we should be buying when nobody is trading and so let's come back to that chart the daily trading volume this time split up by different Trader segments and we see this day over here the 31st of August it was the bottom in trading volume we haven't seen that low trading volume in all the months prior and so had you been part of the minority had you have been one of those few people that actually bought when nobody else was trading then you would have entered over here at roughly 10 cents and you would be up by almost 3x of course this is not a safe game right because nobody knows if a second attention wave will come and so what's always helpful is to see whether or not the price has flawed to a degree if the trading volume is low and the price isn't continuing to go down in other words the whales aren't selling into that low trading volume then things are fine however it's a bad idea to buy during low trading volume when we see continued declines in the price right when the whales continue to offload now how much more upside is there for the Mii token let's compare market caps so here's Mii currently at 150 2 million and with that it's pretty much in the Middle Field it's larger than mudang it's slightly smaller than Simon's Cat or for or py but if the token was to do another 2x it would be close to things like the meme meme coin or the docks meme coin or Constitution D with a 3X it would get close to Turbo and book of Meme and xpx 19600 by the way I made recently videos on all three of those meme coins I also made a video on baby Dogecoin just this week so again feel free to check out the channel feel free to subscribe I publish videos on Meme coins regularly but as usual the art in all of this is to be early the art is to buy when nobody else is buying and to follow the smart money for that we've got the premium membership the link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com we've got a telegram group where we discuss various alt coins and where we also discuss what other influencers are buying and selling right if a large influencer is buying something and subsequently making a video the price is likely going up and so if you're into meme coin trading and especially if you buy early before it's listed on the centralized exchanges when it's still just traded on chain then feel free to check it out and besides premium there's also a free telegram without all of those features but still it's free the link is as well down below looking forward to checking with you over there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lDRGk8Si0Q,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'Safe', 'Turbo', 'JUST', 'Usual',

this really last longer let's have a look as usual on this channel at the onchain analytics let's try to figure out who's actually buying here who's selling here let's see what's driving the price so we currently at 5.8 we are up 131% in the last 24 hours but what looks like Smooth Sailing on the linear chart was actually not without drama we did see our 95% drop at the end of October now to find out where the price will go the website will not really help us but we can get first hints from the Twitter account the number of Twitter followers is roughly 10,000 while the number of members on telegram is 1,600 and the number of holders on chain is 11,000 it all makes sense it's all kind of in the same ballpark there doesn't seem to be too much manipulation by the way if you've got a bit too much time and you want to get some entertainment those Tweets in Doos diary are actually quite entertaining now let's look at the onchain metric on the left side we've got the number of recurring traders in Orange and the number of firsttime traders in purple on the right side we've got the number of token transactions over time now we can ignore the latest data point because today is not yet over I actually expect this to be at least at similar levels compared to Prior days again we can see our two waves of attention the price crashed massively when there was no attention what we see on the left side is a trading volume in US Dollars and on the right side that's normalized to 100% so we can see that over the long term large retail and mediumsized Retail is taking over more and more of the trading volume small retail tends to decline relatively speaking now how is this split up small retail means wallets with less than $11,000 worth of the token medium retail means everything up to 10,000 and large retail means above 10,000 and so instead of looking at the trading volume split we can also look at the number of holders so on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 20,000 bully token so that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token again momentum turned around on the 7th of November and still continues to stay positive for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's not $10,000 worth of the token and on the right side another 10x $100,000 we can see how the number of Wales isn't really changing but we can see how this R is driven by the smaller retail people the number of holders more than 5x in the matter of a bit over a week now just because the number of Wales isn't increasing doesn't mean that their token share is not increasing the whales that are existing seem to be dollar cost averaging into the market because the share of tokens that are currently held by wallets with at least $10,000 worth of the token continues to go up which does pose to a degree a risk right whales are going to take profit at some point but the current move to the upside doesn't yet make it mandatory to sell right we are not 10 Xing in 24 hours it's quote just doubling which is okay for meme coins of that size and with that size I mean 55 million in market cap in the grand scheme of things in the pump. fun ecosystem right this this is a Solana pump. fun token this is not necessarily that large there's plenty of tokens that are double triple and four times the size of that now the big question is always how can we find tokens like this early right how can we find a token like peanut so the largest of the pump. fun ecosystem tokens when it's not above $1 but when it's just at a few cents we want to be early we want to take as much profit as possible we don't necessarily want to buy a token that's already at a billion market cap the upside potential is limited when we are in the billions of dollars and when it takes a lot of money to double yet again so my answer to finding those tokens early is wallet tracking I like to track wallets of other influencers I like to track wallets of insiders I like to track wallets of top traders that tended to make good calls in the past and so have a look at this alert over here this is Crypt benter he bought the peanut token when it was still at 3 cents now since then the price went up by almost 4,000% and here is why Cryptor is of the largest crypto channels in all of YouTube they've got more than 1.1 million subscribers and we are tracking some of their wallets we track in total 33 but it's not just Crypt bter that we're tracking we also track Alex Becker he's got 1.5 million subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets so in total we take more than 400 wallets and so I really believe that this is a better approach than simply just buying random tokens on the list right it's better to buy tokens that already have some good backing behind them in crypto it's easier to become part of the insiders because all of the trades are public right the blockchain is a public Ledger and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated to tutorial course just on wallet tracking how can we find other influencer wallets how can we track those wallets and how can we then interpret the signals that we get from that tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel it's down below the Bitcoin tray.com premium is not just about wallet tracking it's also about back testing it's also about risk mitigation and portfolio diversification it's also about on analytics right the charts that we looked at today in this video once you have got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to update also the analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I do think that the bully token can go higher it's still got a relatively small Market cap and the momentum is positive we do see a lot of accumulation by retail the only question is will the whales dump because they are also accumulating if the overall Market environment stays bullish then probably bully will have a bullish time ahead as well if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I a like would be very much appreciated as well helps your channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t4kPdBXUqU,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'Waves', 'Usual',

bullish for quite a while actually since October of last year now why do I say this because that is when we've seen the turnaround in the capital flows within crypto now in this video we are going to look at the onchain data of the slur meme coin on Solana it's the largest of the mem Cs on Solana when looking at trending tokens ordered by the liquidity pool but we have to look at this in the Granda scheme of things have a look at this chart over here this is the stable coin market cap across all chains starting in 2022 and we had our nice rally and then that abruptly stopped in May of 2022 now what happened in May of 2022 it's the implosion of Terra Luna it's the anchor protocol it's us this is when a billion doll market cap D5 protocol imploded that started a bare market for crypto money was flowing out of crypto and during those outflows FTX collapsed as well now in the beginning of October of last year we have seen finally the turnaround now money is flowing into crypto again now there are two reasons why I like this chart first of all we have very little volatility here right we can clearly see the trend it's not going up and down a lot we can pretty clearly see currently we are going up the second reason why I like this chart so much is because there's a fundamental reason why this is going up or down this is going down whenever crypto is is redeemed whenever stable coins are redeemed for fiat currency it's going up whenever you send your hard-earned Fiat to a centralized exchange and then that centralized exchange sends it maybe to tether and then tether takes custody of that money and then issues the tokens so you can clearly see is money currently flowing out of crypto or is flowing in crypto and currently we see an acceleration of that expansion and so that's the fundamental reason why it makes logical sense to go very risk on right when we buy meme coins we tend to make more than just for holding Bitcoin and if you want to outperform the market we should be very Delta positive whenever the market expands and we should be cautious of course potentially even short tokens whenever the market contracts now let's go back to slur the actual topic of this video slurf is the largest of the trending tokens on the Solana chain it's got a liquidity of 114 million while the market cap is only 176 million it's one of those tokens that is not yet controlled by the centralized exchanges if there's very little liquidity on chain but the market cap is very large that means that there's a lot of ownership outside of the liquidity pools that can then potentially manipulate the price now despite being the largest trending token on Solana when we look at the actual market cap comparison to other mem coins slurf is not that big here is slurf with its market cap right still below 200 million and just have a look at how many other meme coins are larger than slurve this means that there is potential upside right slur could easily double here it could potentially triple maybe even quadruple even after a 5x it would still be smaller than goo maximos or mock coin and so here's maybe the reason why you search for this video you're wondering what happened over here why did the price suddenly jump that much because we up 211% today and 35% this week and almost 90% this month here are the news binance listed slurf Perpetual Futures and that introduces potential easy leverage into the token which can create of course also volatility but first of all it creates a lot of speculation and so have a look at the very long-term chart of slurf first we saw an absolute value destruction we went down by more than 80% but something happened over here on the 8th of November already so prior to the listing there was some event and we're going to look at the onchain metrics in a second there was one event that pushed up the price by 100% within a few days so let's start with the data on the left side we've got the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders per day on the right side we've got the number of token transactions per day and just have a look how the number of firsttime Traders is suddenly pecking up since the 13th of November so before that we had somewhat of an equilibrium the number of firsttime Traders and recurring Traders was pretty equal but then something happened since the 13th of November we see a lot of new wallets entering the token we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over we might see another all-time high who knows also starting in the second half of the chart but a few days earlier on the 8th of November we have seen the number of token transactions spiking up and so that was this point over here now especially mem coin trading is about attention right attention comes in waves it moves from coin to coin and so it's interesting who's currently dominating that attention now on the left side we see the trading volume in US Dollars on the right side we see this normalized to 100% per day and initially upon launch when we had a lot of trading volume it was mainly the large wallets that dominated trading then during the calm times it was more small retail that was buying and selling and now with the rally again and with the listing of binance the Wales are coming back into the game and so here is the chart I want to show you and this again happened before the binance listing this is probably the most important of all of the charts we have looked at it shows the number of holders over time and it split it up by small retail mediumsized retail and large retail now the Wallets on the left have at least $11,000 worth of the token the wallets in the middle have at least $10,000 worth of the token the wallet on the right $100,000 worth of the token now we can see how the whales tended to take profit over time they tended to sell slur over time and that's probably the main reason for this long-term downwards Trend but then something happened on the 8th of November right suddenly the whales are buying back in and it's not just the Wales it's also medium-sized retail and small retail it seems like the current trend is broken across all wallet cohorts and so I do believe that we've finally seen the turnaround in slur I do believe that binance will push up the price at least temporarily especially now that Perpetual Futures are trade as well now the big question is always how can we find good trading opportunities before prices go 10 or 20x so when we look at the largest meme coins on Solana from the pump. fun ecosystem how can we find tokens like peanut or goat when it's just at a few cents and not close to a dollar my answer to this is wallet tracking I like to look at what are the Insiders doing I like to look at what are other large influencers doing I like to figure out what are the Traders doing that tended to make very good calls in the past and so have a look at this this is an alert that crypto Benta bought the peanut token for 3 cents now here's Crypt Benta Crypt bent has more than a million subscribers when they talk about the token of course this generates attention thus a lot of buying pressure and here are the wallets that we have by Crypt Benta through onchain analytics we found out several wallets we now track more than 33 of Crypt bter alone when they are buying when they selling we know this early I have a look at this this is Kyle Chessie that bought the goat token at 14 cents here's the crypto Channel by K chesse 136,000 subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets again in total we've got more than 400 wallets that we're tracking we also track Alex Becka we track all kinds of influencers and so this is then how that looks like right this is Peanut since the buying signal it's up almost 4,000% and here is goat since that buying signal up more than 500% and so this is the fundamental thesis of making money in crypto right we want to have an information Edge crypto is both a game of luck but also of skill if we know more than most people if we get to know those tokens before most others then we can of course buy earlier and on average we make better trades and so I like this strategy so much that I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic how can we find influencer wallets how can we then track those influencer wallets and how can we subsequently also interpret the signals that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel the link is down below it's the Bitcoin trade.com it's not just about wallet tracking it's also about onchain analytics right the charts that we looked at today it's also about risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing all kinds of topics there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare our onchain analytics Etc that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual altcoins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a one we money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you so I do think that slur does has the potential to move quite a bit from here once binance gets more involved in a token we tend to see more volatility in both directions and since we are rather on the lower end in the trading range we can probably go another two or 3 X from here this at least what the market caps imply if you got some very video feel free to subscribe I praise youly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next

Turbo Review, Turbo Price, Turbo Price Prediction, Turbo longterm, Turbo Tokenomics,   #turbo #memecoin #crypto","I'm not telling you any news that turbo is yet at another high again the rally seems to never stop let's have a look again at onchain metrics we have covered tobo several times on this channel let's try to figure out how much longer this rally can last and let's try to find a way to time too properly so we currently at almost 0.9 we are up more than 70% in the last week and on chain we've got almost 40,000 holders that's on ethereum there's also a version on Solana but mostly liquidity is on ethereum and so the analytics of Turbo are very interesting I've covered it several times on this channel and I will continue covering it as I discover new numbers because here's the thing the price is going up but we don't necessarily see how the number of holders with some substantial capital is going up so on the left side we see the number of wallets with $11,000 worth of tobo in the middle $10,000 on the right $100,000 worth of tobo and those charts seem to not really make sense when the price is going straight up like this initially we had seen a lot of wallet growth but that seems to have stalled and we've already talked about this in those prior videos the reason for the change in the onchain analytics is the accumulation by the centralized exchanges now pretty much all of trading volume happens in Black boxes so most trading happens on gate.io and okx and htx and Maxi qoin Etc it does not happen any more on the uni swaps of this world we also have levered bets on the price in terms of Perpetual futures that's dominated by binance and there's almost $600 Million worth of trading volume on the tobo token again in the last day alone and compare this with the onchain metrics now right we only had 1.4 Million worth of trading volume on this pool $600,000 in this pool and though that maybe all adds up to a little bit more than 2 million really the centralized exchanges are now responsible for Price Discovery and so sometimes I get this comment under the videos right why do you always talk about tokens that have already gone up why don't you talk about tokens that will go up but the truth is very often it's trends that will continue it's very important to figure out how sustainable a trend is for example over here the largest winners today and I haven't made any videos today yet are turbo and Bitcoin Bitcoin being the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Eno token and when we look at the performance this week again Bitcoin is one of the top performers turbo as well baby Doge as well and SPX and Nero were massive outperformers as well and 7 days ago was that video on Harry Potter Obama Sonic 10 Eno so very often what used to go up continues to gner more attention and can continue to go up if the whales aren't selling that aggressively here the first video on SPX was 12 days ago it's very rare that we see a completely sleeping cryptocurrency suddenly shooting up what we usually observe is that a really simply accelerates over time and so this channel covers those cryptocurrencies that are in the phase of accelerating r not every rally is sustainable but again that's why we look at the onchain metrix let's now look at the onchain metrix of tobo again because it appears as if there's a lot of interest in this this was the recent video on tobo just published 4 days ago it already outperformed your average video and there's obviously interest and wherever there's interest there can be new investors coming into the token which could lead to higher prices now specifically just for this video I have built a new chart Based on onchain data and this comes from a tool called dun analytics and this is the query so we're looking at the ethereum chain we look at Daily data and we count the number of Sellers and the number of buyers and we start from the beginning of time looking at the contract address and this is what we see here at the bottom we see in percentage terms if on a given day the number of buyers or sellers is dominating and now again I like to look at the extremes and let's see what happened on those days where the buyers dominated because currently it seems like the sellers are dominating let's see what happens in the exact opposite case so over here on the 26th of January and over here on the 9th of May here's the price chart the 26th of January the 9th of May both of those days had a lot of buyers dominating the trading volume and that's then when subsequently a few days later the price ried massively first by 400% afterwards by 800% isn't that fascinating on the specific days the price did not necessarily go up but because a lot of new investors came in that potentially afterwards also dollar cost averaged in we then saw subsequent price relies so this is not the dollar amount right this is just the number of transactions and because we are working with decentralized data we execute all our trades against a liquidity pool this is not an orderbook mechanism where we always have to match buyers and sellers we're simply just changing the weight in a liquidity pool that's why we can have the Distortion and so what does this tell us now now we've got 57% sellers versus only 42% buyers now this seems to have flipped it's not the buyers that are dominating today it's the sellers now why do we see all those sellers maybe because we are close to the all-time high again we have gone sideways to four to 5 months and now we are very close to that high again and before at the end of May the price subsequently went down by more than 60% but all of this data is to be taken with a grain of salt because again now the majority of trading volume doesn't happen on chain anymore so the reliability of those metrics is going down unfortunately right this is how we started off this video most trading now happens in Black boxes and we don't really know what happens over here now in case you want to level up in crypto in case you want to build those onchain analytics tools yourselves there are tutorials in premium so there's one dedicated video roughly half an hour long building onchain tools with june. comom there's a lot of other tutorials as well there is one tutorial specifically just for technical analysis another one for discovering wallets that we can then track and that we can then tropy trade but yeah it's a lot of educational content content that doesn't necessarily do that well on YouTube because it's not flashy it's simply just targeted at getting better in crypto and I believe this is how the markets work the market is both a game of luck and skill and the more we play the game the less the luck component becomes important and more important becomes the skill component the edge is really what matters if we know things that the majority doesn't know if we've got an edge then over time Capital should accumulate to the smart money

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #pyth #altcoins #crypto","everybody and their grandmother is talking about one thing and that's piff 7 days ago a video on the Paul Baron Network around the airdrop 4 days ago a deep dive on Fundamentals by invest answers and look no further one day ago even coin buau talking about it piff here being in the title now I'm not going to bore you with the content that you've already seen I'm not just going to read from the website the tldr is that piff is a dat Oracle directly competing with chain link but as said there are more than enough videos on the fundamentals of piff we are going to look at the things that really matter how much developer activity is there how many transactions are being made how many fees are being generated what's the supply schedule as in how much new additional Supply will hit the market potentially de pressing the price we're going to look at the drivers of supply and demand which in the end should result in the price first data point you probably haven't seen yet what's the developer activity this is GitHub and the team is working frantically on this one change to the code base 1 hour ago another one 5 hours ago 11 hours ago people are working on this nonstop but the big question is always about valuation how fair is piff currently valued and for that we can simply look at how many fees are being generated the the fees measured in s so tokens let's be super optimistic let's let go with the very favorable assumption that every day from now on we will see 168 so tokens being generated in fees every day so that's not the current state right the average is lower but simply let's work with the Positive case 168 * 55.3 that's a daily fee generation of $9,300 roughly and let's multiply this by the days of the year $3.4 million us in fees now there is this idea in traditional Finance of a PE ratio right of a price to earnings ratio and let's take those 3.4 Millions as earnings and let's multiply this with a PE of say 30 that's also comparatively generous doing that gives us a fair valuation of piff of 100 million roughly now what's the market cap currently 620 million fully diluted even 4.3 billion we're going to look at the dilution later so off the B we can already say that the market is pricing in a lot of future growth we already made an assumption of roughly three times the current average revenue remain Assumption of a 30p ratio and still we get an overvaluation of 6X just with the non-diluted market cap now crypto isn't just about fair valuations right crypto is about narratives and one reason why piff is doing so well is because Solana did very well recently and of course piff was an airdrop on the Solana chain what you're seeing over here here is the so price relative to the ethereum price so this is not the US dollar chart this is Solana in eeve and in the last roughly 80 days we saw an outperformance versus Eve of 143% thus a lot of assets on Solana are now outperforming Bonk for example mcoin Bonk being one of them I made a video on Bon just recently feel free to check it out on this channel now seeing Solana outperforming that much is actually quite surprising given that the total value locked the Capital locked on the chain is not increasing that much this is the total value locked in US Dollars and here is the total value locked in s so tokens so even measured in the native token itself we don't see more defi usage and that's again defi Lama measuring across several decentralized apps here's the number of monthly successful non-vote Solana transactions also it's not necessarily increased adoption it's not necessarily increased usage so it appears as if piff is simply one hype built on top of another hype two Hypes Levering on top of each other creating all of that performance creating all of the tension especially with that airdrop I will tell you why I think we can ignore a lot of the fundamentals like what kind of price feeds it has or how it deres those price feeds via regression over all of those different data providers or how the data Oracle Market is really centralized there's only chain link and all competitors have very very little market cap Tor being the second largest but that's also mainly due to manipulation of the price on the derivatives Market made another video on tell on trb as well actually several of them feel free to check them out as well I think one of the main reasons why piff is doing so well is because it has so much support by the centralized exchanges look at where you can trade this this is the spot Market it's available everywhere and this is the derivatives Market you can also trade this everywhere 105 million of per trading volume on binance alone another 7 24 million on bit another 45 million okx and the funding rates are not too extreme in either direction so in other words there's no real consensus no real Market consensus if this is now an inflated price or if this is relatively low this is super good for the centralized exchanges because they don't have to hatch their bets and they make all of those trading fees with the PBS we are currently in altcoin season and with altcoin season comes a lot of very strong outperformance and especially when centralized exchanges push the as well with their derivatives contracts this can go on for a while the main point here is for a while not forever because the Oracle Market is incredibly hard to disrupt because reliability of data is super important why do you need those oracles you need them for example for borrowing and lending platforms so that the borrowing and lending platform can estimate how much is your collateral worth now if you deposit collateral on a defi platform and you borrow against this and the value of your collateral is not estimated the right way maybe the value is overestimated then you could just deposit a lot of that and drain the whole pool you could drain the entire protocol from their funds because you can simply just deposit all of that mispriced collateral and pull out everything in other words a positive track record is super important and you don't just play around with your price Oracle simply because so much is hanging on this one simple buck one simple programming error even if it's just temporary can completely destroy your protocol so as said I believe this really can continue with the centralized exchange support but long term there is a problem especially when we look at the token unlocks check this out we currently have 1.5 billion piff but one year from now this will more than double so if the demand of piff tokens will not more than double within the next year and the price will go down and these kind of cliffs we have several times now this is bad for piff long-term holders if piff cannot instantly take away all of the that market share from chain link which is highly likely but it might be good again for the centralized exchanges because what happens during Cliff unlocks like this a lot of people will be betting on falling prices with the derivatives contracts on those centralized exchanges one year from now a lot of people will see that the supply will increase a lot of videos will be done around this people will buy the shorts will bet on the falling prices and then the centralized exchanges can squeeze all of those shorts they can buy up more and more of the token generating nice nice liquidation fees as well did I promise you too much that you will see things here

listing on binance now in this video we want to find out how much longer this really can potentially last let's have a look at onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's see who's buying and selling the token over time so we are currently at 8183 up 75% today 93% this week and we have been higher in the past there had been massive pumps and dumps before let's have a look how much longer we can potentially pump and whether or not we're going to see a dump yet again so let's first try to find out how much of this is actually organic let's compare a few numbers we've got 2.5 million followers on Twitter and here's the recent announcement about the listing baby Dogecoin is now officially listed on binance and lo and behold we've got another listing on orbit both on the spot but also on the Perpetual Futures market so 2.5 million followers on Twitter 200,000 members on Telegram and how does this compare to the number of holders on chain we've got 19,000 holders on ethereum but here's actually where most of the action is happening on the binance smart chain with 1.8 million holders now sometimes those kind of numbers get artificially inflated so what I like to look at is how many wallets are there that have at least say $11,000 worth of the token or say $10,000 or maybe even $100 $1,000 worth of the token is this all just wallets that have just a few cents or are there actually somewhat serious investors in the token now I've built a tool to answer that question let's first start off with the ethereum based token on the left side we see the number of wallets that have 500 billion tokens or roughly $1,000 worth of the token this tends to grow quite steadily over time and with the recent listings we got another pump of excitement in the middle we've got the number of holders that have at least $10,000 worth of the token also quite a bit of accumulation on the right side we've got the number of holders that have at least $100,000 worth of the token and that grew quite a lot with that announcement it went from six wallets to 10 wallets so percentage wise much more growth on the Wales versus retail now this is the ethereum chain and as said most action actually happened on the binance smart chain and here are the same charts for that binance smart chain and here it looks very different right the growth isn't that obvious the number of holders pretty much didn't grow whatsoever in the last 3 years we got our initial rush but since then no net accumulation we see even more continued selling for the medium-sized holders and the same is true for the large holders that being said we are somewhat flat since the middle of 20123 both for the people with $110,000 but also for the ones with $100,000 so so the selling pressure stopped roughly over here but what's also interesting is how we see this massive pump here without the number of holders going up that much isn't that fascinating right the price roughly tripled and onchain nothing happened and so this gives us a first flavor of what's actually driving the price and so yes there seems to be a lot of organic adoption many many people hold the token but the price action seems to be mainly generated by the Wales by the centralized exchanges not even by the wallets that have $100,000 worth of the token but by the mega Wales let's have a look at the largest wallets so we can simply look at the binance Smart chain and order this by holding size most tokens are actually in a debt wallet so those are burnt tokens and that tends to increase over time not that steeply anymore compared to the past but still tokens get burnt but that doesn't explain why the price can crash like this one explanation for a price crash can be vesting or in other words toen allocation that goes to the team overtime token allocation that might go to centralized exchanges and interestingly enough initially we had tokens being sent to that vesting contract and it seems like the majority of those tokens have now unlocked roughly 60% or so so we go from 70p I don't know what that is Pinon down to currently 40 pillion let's have a look at the wallets of some centralized exchanges so any swap bitg get binance and Mexi any swap initially accumulated up until the beginning of the year now tends to slightly sell off and still has a lot of tokens bitg get tends to accumulate binance tends to accumulate now this can be a transfer just before the listing for Market making and Mexi also tends to accumulate this seems to be customer deposits because this is updated quite regularly and so baby doge is not just a meme coin they also have their own decentralized exchange unfortunately that centralized exchange isn't used that much so here it is it supports the binance smart chain ethereum polygon and the optimism based BNB and here is the total value locked over time unfortunately it's now a former shell of itself with only 2 million total value locked and so it very much appears as if baby Doge continues to be strongly in the hands of the centralized exchanges readies like this generate attention and potential opportunities for centralized exchanges to sell off so I would not be surprised if we continue to see this pattern for the foreseeable future now just because we are high now doesn't mean that we can't see a secondary rally because the attention is generated on both fronts right on the people that consider buying in but also on the people that consider shorting the token and if there's enough short interest it might make sense for those centralized exchanges to just short squeeze so to just buy up more again in order to create a secondary really so nobody really knows at what point in time we will see the crash but at some point I do believe we will see again very similar flaws to what we have seen in 2021 in 2022 in 2023 and of course also this year this is one of the largest tokens on the binance smart chain so the listing is actually quite late check this out this is the binance Smart chain this is all tokens on the Chain ordered by liquidity and baby doge is at number nine and it's got even more transactions than red BNB versus tether the trading volume in the last 24 hours for baby Doge was even larger than for rep BNB so this is really the big guys playing against one another I personally don't touch the token I don't like to be involved in those kind of games I like to play Rather market inefficiencies and they're probably not in the most liquid of the tokens I will continue to make updates on baby Doge in the future if you don't want to miss those updates feel you to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow in case you've got telegram

than 100% in the last 24 hours alone let's have a look at what's causing this R whether or not this R can continue and if it still makes sense to buy Tina let's have a look at onchain data most people aren't considering to figure out what's happening behind the price action who's buying here who's selling here so we currently at $3.31 we are up 134% today almost 1700% this week at more than 2,300 this year now tatina is the second largest decentralized exchange on the binance smart chain and here's the News That's creating all of that excitement Tina gets traded on binance and is getting an airdrop it's 7% of the max token Supply and there's an earning program attached to this now this is no surprise the Tena token or th does not get traded most on TAA itself but actually on the binance centralized exchange 9 .5% of spot trading volume happens on binance and we've got a ton of derivative Futures Contract trading as well more than 2.2 billion worth of Tina tokens moved hands in the last 24 hours alone and so then this chart is no real surprise it's mainly driven by the very large buyers we can see this here on the right on Dex screen.com there's only 36% buyers versus 64% of sellers but we are still up 143% because the amount that the buyers buy is way way larger than what this the sellers are selling now here's the website but there's not a lot of unique information that can help us estimate whether or not this really lasts longer let's look at the data most people are not considering let's first get an idea of how Tina Compares in trading volume to the largest of the decentralized exchanges on the binance smart chain which is pancake swap pancake swap had a trading volume in the last 24 hours of 1.3 billion Tena had a trading volume of 300 million so pancake swap is roughly four to five times larger the market cap of TAA is 260 million the market cap of pancake swap is 900 million so roughly four times the size a bit less than that so if the trading volume of Tina today was representative of what's going to happen in the future and if the toomics were exactly the same then Tina would relatively speaking to Pancake swap now be overvalued now here's an interesting chart this shows how much money is currently locked up in the TAA decentralized exchange how much money is in the liquidity pools in the staking programs Etc and this did go up with the recent rally of the Tina token but generally speaking it's not really a nice Trend unfortunately we peaked at 170 million roughly and now we are at 50 million let's have a look at a few social metrics so we've got 175,000 followers on the xplatform that compares to 15,000 members on Telegram and that compares to 22,000 holders on the bin smart chain this recent rally is definitely generating a lot of attention what we've got here on the left is the number of new wallets per day for the th token in the last month and before the announcement this was minuscule at around 20 wallets or so this then shot up to 3,300 wallets then climbed even further to 5,600 and we can ignore the latest data point because today hasn't yet finished right today just started there is a lot of growth and we can also see this in the number of new users relative to returning users this spiked a lot it was a lot of new wallets getting in we see this also in the number of buyers and sellers per day it went pretty much 30X with that announcement and there is an interesting development on chain regarding this price development in the last month so the price skyrocketed but here's what happened on chain people bought the token first and now they're moving all of those tokens and some to the binance centralized exchange for earning now on the left side we see small retail investors those are wallets with at least 300 th tokens that's worth roughly $1,000 worth of the token today in the middle we've got mediumsized retail so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the whales that's $100,000 worth of the token and the whales are doing this move the most so it seems to be a clever thing to do right the whales tend to make the better calls you want to follow whatever the smart money is doing and so with that Locker program of course the liquid Supply suddenly gets down a lot which means that the price can go up right less Supply same kind of demand or even increasing demand means a rising price now let's also have a look at at the long-term development so this is just the holder development in the last month let's also have a look at this since launch on the binance smart chain and we did see pretty continuous accumulation across the board it was most constant among the Wales but now the Wales are all quote unquote cashing out or should we rather say deploying the capital putting it to use once the earning program becomes less attractive once people withdraw that Tena token then of course all of that price appreciation can turn around again this is what we' have seen for examp example with the cake token when they announc their staking program now here's the thing I believe that most upside potential is in the small market cap tokens and it's especially in the meme coins have a look at this in the last s days what performed the best it's all meme coins and it's hundreds of percent potentially we talked about chill guy early on this channel we talked about bully early on this channel we also talked about the tits token early on this channel so feel free to follow here because here's a problem once a token Rises to a certain market cap it takes a lot of capital again to double and triple the token and especially for mem coins that do have a lot of risk that can easily go down by 50 60% you do still want to see the upside potential and so when the market cap is already pretty high in the billions of dollars then there is not that much upside potential but there's still the downside potential so the risk versus reward isn't that great have a look at this this is the largest mem coins in the last week pretty much everything went down only Dogecoin went slightly up so once a meme coin has risen to a certain level it's time to be cautious it might make sense to go into the tokens that are not in the billions but only in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions but the question is always how can we pick the right small meme coin right there are so many small meme coins how do we not get burned and I believe the answer to this is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and once we've got a wallet of a certain influencer of somebody that moves markets of somebody that is a top Trader of somebody that did do the right things in the past once we have those wallets we've got a very nice mechanism to filter what to buy and what to sell he look at this so this is Martini guy and he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 so that was even before the listing on radium so that was directly on the pump. fun ecosystem platform when he bought his position went up by more than 4,000% of course it subsequently collapsed but that's the idea of trading right you don't just want to buy and hold meme coins mem coins are a rotation game you want to be in as long as the momentum is positive and you want to exit very quickly once it turns around I have a look at this year another alert by the martini guy he bought the fatest token again directly on pump fun and again a very similar development so the purchase happened directly on the platform subsequently the price went up by 1, 680% and then came crashing back down now what's important with buying tokens that early with tracking other influencers is that first of all we have to take profit but secondly also we have to be somewhat Diversified we can't bet half of our portfolio on a single bet this is very risk on so here again the martini guy he bought chippy and that was at 2022 here are his purchases now it's at 20 one6 so there are trades that don't necessarily always work out it is a game of Risk versus reward you want to buy when the upside is still there you don't want to buy the meme coins that are in the billions of dollars but when going risk on like this it's more important than with any other strategy not to lose everything right it's important to make small bets every now and then and then take profit when those make multiple X returns and so that's why I made several tutorial videos on the topic on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification of course also on onchain tracking Etc now I've talked about him now often enough so here is that guy this is Martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers and we track 12 of his wallets we did this through onchain analytics we found out some of his wallets now check this out this is Alex Becka's Channel we also track his wallets he's got 1.5 million subscribers now when he talks about a token it puts that much attention on the token that of course the price has to rise we've got also 12 of his wallets we're also tracking Crypt Benta with 1.1 million subscribers we've got 33 of their wallets and so I really believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's not just buying random tokens that are funny that are in some kind of list of trending tokens I think it's much more important to follow the Insiders it's to follow the early money it's to follow the people that have more attention that can push prices higher I like this strategy of wallet tracking that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course on just that so it's eight videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to discuss our onchain analytics we have to compare what kind of conclusions we come to that's why we've got our dedicated Chats on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so it doesn't make sense to still buy TAA right now potentially right there's still an imbalance between supply and demand that being said at some point this will turn around again this is a play with toomics this is somewhat artificially inflated and so there's going to be some volatility along the way right so it's probably important to put some kind of a trailing stop-loss as well it does not make sense to be in the token when the crash starts but right now momentum is still positive we're probably going to rise a bit further but at some point this will turn around I believe if you got some very video feel fre to subscribe I publish regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYY_zA4j0VE,"['Dogecoin', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EYY_zA4j0VE/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-28T09:54:08Z

#magahat #crypto","make America great again a lot of people had been excited about the crypto token just one week ago we had a look at the onchain data now the price did not develop too well let's have a look again at the onchain data did something fundamentally change in the momentum or is this just a short-term blip that we should be buying into because initially when I published my first video on the mega head token there was a lot of excitement there was a lot of people clicking on the video the video outperformed the average video but now why did the price go down it's not retail but let's take it step by step here's the performance of the video the mega head token published 7 days ago the average performance of a video is in Gray this video though outperformed that's the line here in blue at the time the price was at 0.06 now the price is at 0.04 cents a decline in the last week by more than 30% what's going on here have we seen the final Peak or does it make sense to buy the dip by the way please don't confuse those two tokens there is the Mega head meme coin but there's also the mega Trump meme coin with a very very different price in this video we're talking about Mega hat let's revisit the onchain statistics let's have a look at the number of holders both for retail but also for the Wales the chart that we see over here is the last 30 days and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold roughly 2.5 million tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 for the middle chart we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's the number of wallets that hold at least $100,000 worth of the token now the dynamic of those charts have massively changed in the last week and that's why I make this update video retail has completely stopped accumulating in the last week mediumsized retail so the wallets that have at least $10,000 worth of the token went down in the last week and and the whales they really sold off so the number of wallets with at least $100,000 worth of the mega head token they are the ones that are responsible for this 30% decline so if retail isn't buying in anymore and the whales tend to sell this is what we see in the end and so this shows again how timing of meme coins is incredibly important had you bought the Trum token over here so somewhere around the 19th or 20th of May instead of over here would have done a quite nice return but the question is how can we learn about this token so early again I believe the answer is in onchain data or to be a bit more precise in wallet tracking so what I like to do is I like to look at other influencers I like to look at other top traders that tend to interact with tokens very very early and then I look at those tokens and I consider should I buy or should I not buy and specifically for the Mega head token we got those signals very very early in premium have a look at our influencer telegram alert Channel we're tracking various wallets here and we saw that Unis dong received quite a lot of the mega token on the 18th of May that influencer sold though but then afterwards what we noticed is how crypto got John he bought into the same token several times a lot of buying signals and here's the corresponding timing on the chart so this is when Unis D Wong received the tokens and sold this is when crypto got John bought and afterwards we had our nice rally of more than 700% so there is a bit of work involved here right there are a lot of different wallets that we are tracking and those wallets tend to buy and sell several tokens so it's not like you can simply just copy trade something you still have to do your own due diligence that being said in the vast sea of thousands of cryptocurrencies where we have no idea what could potentially go up following the people that tend to make the right calls that tend to make money in crypto is I believe a winning strategy doing similar trades as the winners is a profitable approach and so yes I believe it does make sense to be somewhat cautious with megat Trump at least the Wales right the smart money that have so much in the token they are selling off and as per tendency the people that have most money also tended to make the right calls in the past that's why they've got so much money so when they are selling it makes sense to not be too optimistic but there's no need to marry a token there's new tokens getting launched every day the trick is simply to find those early before the masses and that can be achieved by looking at the right wallets if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I prly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you don't yet want to pay

Barcelona's bar token reached nearly $60 at its peak in 2021 however by the end of 2023 the price has decreased to between $160 and $2 such price fluctuations can affect the financial well-being of both clubs and plans invested in this token the volatility creates uncertainty and increases risk for all participants it's crucial to remember that cryptocurrencies are still considered highrisk

transaction histories we do see some details this is all built on the cosmos SDK but unfortunately we don't have any aggregate statistics we don't know how do the number of transactions develop over time but this is already quite interesting 53 internal transactions in a single block this looks like real usage we are still super early so even def llama is lagging behind telling us there's only $4 of total value locked and that's all in one protocol it's $482 to be exact in the oselot decks that's this decentralized exchange over here but this all looks still very rudimentary this airdrop has generated a lot of bus and so we've got 961 th000 followers for The Zeta chain Twitter account or X account now here's something that's super important with new project especially and that's token dilution how many tokens are already circulating and how many tokens will unlock to early investors and to the team Etc diluting the people that now Buy in and there's a very nice website that tends to update that information very quickly it's Cryptor rank. and here we've got the vesting tab so the vesting schedule for a Zeta chain we see the maximum Supply is 2.1 billion ion we see that we've got 1.27% of that unlocked and 88.6% of that still locked and who's getting this 22% to core contributors 16% to advisors 12 to the ecosystem fund Etc a lot of the tokens are still going to the project owners and so here we've got the details of the unlocks coin market cap says that 11% is so far circulating crypto rank says that 10% are untracked and the other 1.27 are unlocked so that kind of matters the untracked here is seen as already unlocked by coin market cap still it doesn't matter that much the number of circulating tokens will roughly 10 x from here in other words if the demand doesn't 10 x in that same time frame as well the price will go down over the very very long term now who's currently driving that rally let's have a look at onchain data there are two versions of the token one of them on ether scan where we've got three 323 holders another version on the binance smart chain where we've got 4,500 holders isn't that interesting now let's agregate retail versus the whale wallets this is a tool that I've built myself and that I make available to the premium members the link is down below it's the bitcoin.com that's where you get access and a tutorial for this tool on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 Zeta chain tokens so at the current price that's $1,700 this could be considered the average retail in because this is the ethereum chain and you need to pay quite a bit of gas to buy and sell on ethereum so the betting size tends to be higher in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's $117,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales at least $170,000 worth of the token at the current prices now all of those wallets are accumulating this is good what you do not want to see on a chart like this is that the whales are selling while retail is buying right you don't want the whales to dump on the retail people we don't see that here we see accumulation across the board now one might expect that we'd see way more action on the binance mar chain because here we've got 4,500 holders that's actually not the case even if we drastically reduce the number of tokens so only 10 tokens as a minimum threshold on the left side we only have 300 holders once we go a 10x from that and another 10x so this here now is 1,000 tokens we only have six such Wallets on the binance smart chain and on ethereum we've got more than 100 wallets still doesn't this look somewhat fishy a project with hundreds of millions of market cap and billions of fully diluted market cap only having a few hundred wallets with $11,000 in it isn't that strange I think I've got the answer to that puzzle have a look behind me at the table behind me this is the trading volume and a ton of trading volume happens on okx and on qoin we've also got buybit and coinbase gate.io is part of the party as well and we've even got already Perpetual Futures on this on Mexi on a project that has just launched this is very uncommon and this is a reason for concern I do believe that the centralized exchanges have their hands in here that there's somewhat of a cash grab going on here I don't have a crystal ball either I don't know how long this R can last I don't know how long the price will get manipulated but I do have the strong strong hunch here that there is manipulation going on and that at some point the price is likely going to be lower than where it is today there's simply too much token dilution going on if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I probably you this regly a like would be very much

PNUT Crash Incoming  ‚ò¢Ô∏è Peanut the Squirrel Crypto Token Analysis,"In today‚Äôs video, we dive into the world of PNUT, the Peanut the Squirrel-themed crypto token, and analyze its current market trends. With recent fluctuations and signs of a potential crash on the horizon, we break down the factors influencing the token‚Äôs value, the risks involved, and what investors should be watching out for. Whether you‚Äôre already holding PNUT or considering entering the market, this analysis will give you a clearer picture of what‚Äôs happening and how to navigate the volatility. Don‚Äôt miss out on this in-depth look at the Peanut the Squirrel crypto phenomenon!","everything is green except one thing is greener than others peanut is absolutely crushing it with the recent R it's now in the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies now in this video I want to share the YouTube stats on prior peanut videos on this channel I also want to share the newest onchain analytics we want to find out how much longer this really can last or if it potentially makes sense to take some profit now so the first video on Peanut on this channel was published one week ago a typical video is here in Gra and the peanut video initially performed quite typical but then a second Rush came in that is when the price appreciated another new video just followed that's already outperforming since the very beginning and so when that first video went online we were still at 11 to 12 cents now we are at 87 cents up more than 600% does it make sense to take profit now before we get into the data one more thing I publish videos on various meme coins regularly on this channel so if you don't want to miss the next one if you want to be early feel free to subscribe now let's jump into the data with this rally peanut is now finally the largest trending token on the Solana chain its liquidity pool is 14 million and it's only followed by the ACT token which by the way red to a similar degree due to similar reasons both tokens got recently listed on binance now here's something I recommend everybody to do whenever considering to buy a token have a look at the Dex screener page and have a look at the number of buyers and sellers because that can give a hint of where the current price action might be coming from we know that the price appreciated by 83% that's obvious but here's data we can only get through onchain analytics the number of buyers is actually smaller than the number of sellers in the last 24 hours but the buying volume is higher than the selling volume in other words there's more dollars flowing in that's why the price is going up but those dollars come from fewer people when a price Ries like this usually the sellers should have more Capital than the buyers because people play with similar amounts of capital right let's say you put $1,000 in a meme coin when that then 10 X's then you're likely going to sell $5,000 and the next person that might buy might still just put in $1,000 they might not increase their betting size suddenly and so when we see that the amount that the buyers move is much larger than the amount that the sellers move per transaction that means especially for a token that went up massively that the whales are now completely kicking in and we can see this as well in the onchain analytics check this out we almost doubled in the last 24 hours but the number of firsttime Traders actually wasn't that high it was lower than the day before usually when the number of Traders goes down by more than 2/3 we should expect with the low intention that also prices go down but that's not what we observe with peanut we also see that on chain the number of token transactions went down almost by 2/3 as well by the way please ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over so this bar hasn't yet completely filled up what we've got over here is the trading volume and I want to put the focus on the normalized trading volume on the right so on the left it's just the trading volume in US Dollars on the right it's normalized to 100% per day and we can see how small retail takes up less and less of the trading volume now small retail simply means the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token now all of those effects are supported by people simply moving their tokens now over to binance in order to potentially sell them there but it looks like the market makers at binance and the Wales they are selling up the token so on chain we still see more sellers than buyers and we very very likely would see this on the centralized exchanges as well if they were transparent unfortunely they aren't but it's a few big people that buy it all up likely for Market making likely for manipulation likely to increase volatility at some point and so that's then how that looks like over time the Wales hold more and more of the Supply peanut is now owned with 93% by the Wales now here's the thing the market is obviously 100% risk on now Bitcoin hits new all-time highs and especially the levered meme coins they make most gains and within the mem coin Market it's mainly the newly launched tokens on Solana in the pump fun ecosystem that make most money check this out this is the category stab on coin gecko ordered by the performance in the last 7 days and pump fun is leading everything there there is a slight issue though with peanut and that's the potential upside peanut is already the largest of the tokens on pump fun it used to be goat now it's peanut and so I'm not saying that peanut has to go down of course the pump fun ecosystem in total continues to expand I expect this to continue for the next week maybe for the next month potentially for the several next months but I don't think that peanut will still fly as quickly as it did in the last 7 days I do not believe we will see another 700% gain in the next 7 days because that would put the market cap at 5 to 6 billion and that would then make it the third largest meme coin in the entire ecosystem larger than Pepe just behind cha Eno and Dogecoin I believe it's in the smaller market caps that aren't in the hundreds of millions yet just have a look at what performed pretty well in the last s days we've got memes AI we've got based we've got nnom I'm not endorsing any of those coins but I do believe that with the right approach we can find those winners early now let me show you how I heard about peanut early how I heard about peanut at this point here when we were still at 3 cents since then we are up by more than 2,400 per. the way to find those things early is via wallet tracking by following the people that in the past tended to make the right calls that tend to be insiders that tend to influence markets because the blockchain is 100% transparent we can see what other people are doing for example Stan crypto bought peanut on on the 3rd of November a crypt Benta bought peanut again on the 3rd of November that was here at the 3 cents Mark and so we've got more than 400 wallets that we track in total for Crypt Benta we've got 33 wallets that we are tracking Crypt Benta has more than a million subscribers on YouTube they definitely move markets when they talk about a token the token goes to the moon and so I strongly believe in the strategy of course those wallets aren't public so the art in all of this is to actually find those wallets and because of that I made a tutorial course on just that topic how can we find different influencer wallets how can we then afterwards track them and how can we afterwards also interpret the signals that we get from the tracking this is all part of the premium membership it's not just about wallet tracking there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total there's also onchain analytics that we looked at today there's also portfolio management Etc and so once we've got a signal by those wallets we of course discussed it in dedicated groups in premium it's currently 100 $25 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so can peanut further R yes of course it can together with the pump fund ecosystem but the price development now is 100% in the hands of the market makers they are currently pushing up the price it's the whales that are buying it's not anymore the broad Market the broad Market tends to rather sell right now if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regly feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

AIXBT Review, AIXBT Price, AIXBT Price Prediction, AIXBT longterm, AIXBT Tokenomics,   #AIXBT #memecoin #crypto","AI xbt is the largest token the largest AI agent that comes from the virtuals protocol on the base chain now let's have a look whether or not it still makes sense to buy AI xbt let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's see who's buying and selling here to try to figure out whether or not this current rally is organic or if this is a pump and dump we need to figure out what's going on beyond the price action we need to find out what's driving ups and downs in the price because only then we can find out if it still makes sense to buy now here's a list of virtual protocol tokens those are all AI agents and it's the newest thing on the base chain Solana is all about meme coin trading the base chain is all about AI agents and over here we've got AI xpt it's down today but it's got a market cap of 172 million already and so everything surrounding the virtuals protocol seems to do pretty well recently there's more more usage of virtual itself as well so what we've got over here is the number of launched tokens per day day on virtuals and while 2 to 3 weeks ago that was still at around 50 per day now we are seeing more than a th000 per day we can ignore the latest data point because today isn't yet over I have a look at this the trading volume per day it's now at 28.5 million no matter what metric for virtuals we are looking at it's all going up and so as an extension AI xpt is doing very well an increase of 73,000 in the last 3 weeks and again today we see a little bit of a bre but let's see what continues from here let's have a look at Social metrics let's have a look at onchain data now on Twitter or the xplatform we've got 56,000 followers in telegram we've got 4,000 members and on chain we've got 21,000 holders roughly now that's on the base chain there's also another version on Solana with 4,000 holders so in total it's roughly 25,000 holders and that doesn't really match up with the number of followers on Twitter right so it seems like there is some kind of manipul ation happening on the Twitter social media account now that manipulation seems to also partially at least continue on chain have a look at this year this is the number of new users versus returning users per day and for whatever reason we see this huge Spike on the 22nd of November this does not look natural at all so this might be the team this might also be some Rogue player that simply tried to figure out what to do with certain Bots but we can definitely say that those 11,000 holders are not just natural growth it makes zero sense that on the next day we've got very low new user numbers again and then we've got this massive massive Spike on a single day we can see the exact same Spike over here it seems like a lot of small wallets got created to maybe artificially bring some attention to the token and so that then makes it also harder to believe these charts here they look very very healthy actually if this is 100% organic those are very good charts because they show the number of small retail investors that currently have roughly $1,000 worth of the token the number of medium-sized retail that's up to $110,000 and the number of Wales that's up to $100,000 worth of the token there is very nice constant growth across the board only the Wales recently in the last 3 to 4 days started to decrease in numbers that started on the 26th of November but it looks like the Wales aren't selling quickly enough to kill this Val right the price still went up by more than 200% since then and so we haven't seen those wh wallets move any funds whatsoever in the past now recently they take over more more of the trading volume so we've got the trading volume on the left in US Dollars we've got this on the right normalized to 100% it seems like the larger wallets tend to make up more and more of that trading volume over time and those are probably mainly selling transactions so as long as this doesn't collapse super quickly as long as the growth by small retail is still faster than the selling by the Wales you might continue to see some price appreciation the holding is pretty balanced so the percent that's held by the Wales and by large retail is somewhat high of course but there's no real Trend here we seem to be in equilibrium and so as long as the virtual protocol continues to grow I believe that the AI xpt token is likely going to appreciate as well is it now the best risk to reward bet I'm not so sure right if you want to be somewhat risk off it probably makes sense to Simply buy virtual directly if you want to get the upside potential it probably makes more sense to take the smaller of those AI agent tokens it appears to me that AI xpt is somewhat Stuck in the Middle right it doesn't have the perfect upside potential but it also doesn't really protect against the downside for that simply buying virtual itself I believe makes more sense now crypto as a whole is currently expanding very very quickly what we've got behind me is the stable coin market cap and this is a threeyear chart so it starts in July 2021 and we peaked in the stablecoin market cap in April of 2022 over here what happened was the Terra Luna collaps so this is when anchor protocol went bust this is when us deped the market Market as a whole shrunk money was flowing out of crypto and this is also where FTX collapsed and then we saw the turnaround in October of last year now money is flowing into crypto again and that's recently accelerating the stable coin market cap going up means of course that money is Flowing from Fiat into crypto and that of course means that prices across all of the crypto space should continue to rise I really like this chart because it has very little volatility we can see the trend very clearly in the short term though we might be slightly it what we've got over here is again a stable coin market cap chart but this time that's not in US Dollars this time it's relative to the entire crypto market so you might have heard of the Bitcoin dominance chart right how much of all of crypto is currently in Bitcoin that's by the way currently at roughly 60% it tends to pick at around 70% what we see over here is the stable coin dominance so how much of all of crypto is currently in the stable coins and there is a strong inverse correlation between this and and crypto prices so when the stable coin dominance is high crypto prices are low and when the stable coin dominance is low crypto prices are high and we seem like at least temporarily to hit some potential flaw here which might mean that some cryptocurrencies might see local tops that being said especially in the last few days we do see how the altcoins tend to outperform the rest of crypto so this is the others dominance so this is the cryptocurrency market cap that's not in the top 10 and this did go up since beginning of November to today by 23% it appears as if there is some kind of altcoin rotation happening at least we see the beginnings of it and so what was the best performer across all of the altcoins in the last week it's virtual protocol virtual is a Launchpad of AI agents on the base chain and it almost tripled in the last week this is the long-term chart very impressive and the big question is how can wey buy something like virtual when it's not up there but when it's somewhere down here my answer to this question is wallet treking it's trying to figure out what are other smart investors doing what are insiders doing what are people doing that move prices what are people doing that tended to make the right calls in the past and so it's always nice to see what is the Smart money doing what is the not so smart money doing for example this over here this is an alert that bitboy crypto sold virtually tokens at 1.4 we don't have the alerts where he bought this so maybe he got some allocation because he's an influencer but he sold his allocation he did this multiple times by the way and again what he sold subsequently went up by more than 10,000% and so yeah bit boy crypto in my opinion is pretty much the Jim Kramer of crypto it doesn't make sense to copy trade him but it's interesting to see what he's doing there are other people though that are worth copy trading for example over here we've got crypto gains that bought the virtual token that was at 5.8 so since then the price went up by 2, 500% who is crypto gains it's this influencer here he tends to buy tokens relatively early and he tends to also be very public about his purchases which can generate of course a lot of attention and can bring in more investors pushing up the price further so he does very risky Place regularly he's got 138,000 subscribers and so how do we get these by and sell signals it's through finding the right wallets first and foremost right it's doing some onchain analytics to figure out those wallets and it's subsequently by putting those wallets in a wallet tracker and get notifications whenever they buy and sell so over here we've got the wallets by crypto gains that we are tracking we've got 55 of his wallets but then at a later point in time we also see more people buying into the virtual token the people that tend to deploy much more capital for example over here we've got Kyle Chessie that bought $100,000 worth of of the token and that was at 48 cents and so here is K chesse he's got 137,000 subscribers and since he bought the price went up by 220% we've got 12 of his wallets and of course not every trade goes like this but in general right I do believe it makes sense to follow the smart money it is much better to follow the people that tend to make profit compared to simply just picking random tokens in a list and so I like this approach that much that I made eight dedicated tutorial videos just on this wallet tracking topic they over here it's how to find various influencer wallets it's how to track those influencers and it's also about how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the bitcoin.com it's not just wallet tracking that we do it's also risk mitigation portfolio diversification back testing there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total in premium once we've got a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell that's why we've got our dtic chats for the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $165 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first s days and I will refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so I personally I do not buy the token I don't buy a ipt I think it's better to buy the smaller tokens they have more upside or to simply just allocate to Virtual directly because I do think that more and more trading volume will go to towards the AI agent space What meme coin trading with pump. fun is for Solana is likely going to be the virtual protocol with AI agent trading on base if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you

now let's have a look at the onchain metrics let's try to figure out what's going on let's try to see who's buying and selling here and whether or not it makes sense to still buy now we are currently at 11 cents per peanut we are up 138% today and we're not going to talk about the political background Etc this is a channel that focuses on onchain analytics we try to find out whether or not makes sense to buy something now let's first see if this is all manipulation or if there's a lot of retail investors buying so on Twitter or the xplatform we've got roughly 12,000 followers in telegram we've got roughly 10,000 members a third of them are currently online and on chain we've got 36,000 holders so all of those numbers kind of align if you were to see a big outlier here right say the number of Twitter followers being 10 times larger than the number of holders or if there was an order of magnitude difference in general then I'd be skeptical this seems to be at least theoretically somewhat reasonable now why are we interested in peanut in the first place when we look on chain on Solana it's one of the top trending tokens it's currently at number six in terms of liquidity $4.2 million are in the liquidity pool and so times haven't always been that nice we did see quite a bit of a dump before of 74% I will come back to this point over here when we were at 3 cents in a second let's first have a look at the onchain statistics itics on the left side we see the trading volume in US dollars for different wallet cohorts on the right side we see this normalized to 100% now it seems like interest is fading it seems like trading volume is coming down but at the same time the price is going up what's going on here's a first hint have a look at the trading volume just by the Wales that's not necessarily coming down that's at a new Peak when we look at the normalized trading volume we can also see that over time the fraction of small retail trading volume tends to decline it's the big money that's entering now for any meme coin to appreciate longterm we need to see the retail money right we need to see the small people supporting the price because the Ws they can pump up a token but they can also dump it let's have a look at the number of new investors per day so that's here on the left side the number of first-time Traders is in purple the number of recurring Traders is in Orange and here again we tend to see this declining we can ignore the very last data point though because the day hasn't yet finished at the same time we see how the number of token transactions isn't declining as quickly again hinting towards a few players making most of the price action during this rally now it's not the number of whales that's going up it's simply just a few whales that are buying a lot because when we look at the holder split over time so now we count the number of wallets with a minimum holding threshold we see that the number of holders with 10,000 tokens tends to still grow but not super quickly not as quickly as in the first few days 10,000 tokens is equivalent to a bit over $11,000 we can also see how mediumsized retail so that's now 100,000 tokens stopped accumulating on the 2nd of November and we can see how the whales tend to go down in numbers so it's not just more and more whales getting in it's just a few large wallets purchasing a lot and so we can very nicely see this in how much value is held by those different wallet cohorts 54% of value is held by the whale wallets and that's more than half of the entire Supply the fractions of tokens held by the Wales is going up the fraction of tokens held by the other cohorts is going down and so as so often with crypto it's all about being early it's about buying before the pump and so that's why I want to talk again about this data point over here in the premium membership of this channel we got an alert that Crypt benter a YouTube channel with more than a million followers bought peanut so that alert happened on the 3rd of November at 3 cents per token so again over here here's the YouTube Channel 1.09 million subscribers and we've got 33 of Crypt banter wallets now those are not official wallets right those are wallets that we found out with our research there's all kinds of approaches we take in order to find influencer wallets and we put them all in our premium tracking so this is Crypt Benta but we've also got wallets by Alex Becker also a YouTube channel with a million followers and we've got wallets by top Traders not necessarily a big following but definitely doing good calls power pa. Sol he was one of the earliest investors in Brett for example and so of course naturally we are discussing those signals in premium so we've got our D channel on the 3rd of November are you all seeing the peanut stuff that's by the way Fred as well and the whale bought 750k of both so I believe this is what crypto is all about it's all about getting an edge it's about knowing more than the average Joe if you're buying a token just because it's up and without any additional information you're probably long-term going to lose and so that's why there's also a dedicated tutorial section just on wallet tracking so there are eight videos how to find different influencer wallets how to track them and how to then afterwards interpret the tracking signals there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total including risk management including onchain analytics so all the charts that we looked at today you can plug in your own tokens into the tools and look at this yourself for your own tokens now premium is currently $125 per month there is a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% peanut is interesting it's a token that's currently getting pushed by the centralized exchanges or buy some big whales it can dump very quickly as well but probably the momentum will continue for a while if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly feel free to also give this video a like it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aegJtAL8tw,"['Solana', 'JUST', 'Threshold', 'JOE', 'WHY', 'SIX']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4aegJtAL8tw/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-06T11:26:45Z

there are some news but let's also look at some onchain statistics to have an idea whether or not this rally could potentially last longer let's look at the data most people aren't considering let's see what's actually happening over the last months is there potentially some opportunity most people are overlooking so here's the r I'm talking about we are currently at $28 up more than 30 % today here's the news it appears that all FTX creditors will get their money back and this is of course very positive for the ftt token because it's written here at the top of the coin market cap page the FTX bankruptcy proceedings are underway the ftt token no longer is in use and may be liquidated by the estate to pay creditors but maybe not because apparently there is enough money and this is what's pushing up the price so we are up more than 30% today we are up more than 50% this week but of course here it goes at some point the ftt token was at above $70 and here is when FTX declared bankruptcy that's when the massive massive crash happened but this is crypto and of course we can still buy assets by bankrupt companies just have a look most trading volume happens on binance and on gate.io here's the relative chart of FDT to to ethereum so I always like to look at relative performance to ethereum because a lot of assets are coupled in ethereum based liquidity pools at the beginning ftt was simply just riding with ethereum right pretty much in a sidewards trading range then came the bankruptcy the massive crash a subsequent bleed with some people buying a bit later then some fake news around an FTX relaunch that then subsequently got sold off again and now we see the recent rally which is costed by those recently positive news so yes this is a news driven token but let's have a look at who's buying and selling here is this the whales that push up the price with this news or is this small retail who's actually buying into FDT now to answer this question I have built a tool that distinguishes retail from the Wales the tool is available for the premium members it's down below the Bitcoin trade.com you can pluck in any ethereum based token in this tool and look at those charts on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 500 ft token so at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I'd consider small retail on the ethereum Chain because ethereum has very high gas fees right in the middle we've got mediumsized retail so that's now a 10x in minimum holding so you need now 5,000 tokens so $10,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's the number of wallets that hold at least $100,000 worth of ftt now over the years this went up quite nicely isn't that surprising because over the years ftt did not outperform ethereum a lot of that has to do with token inflation there were simply just more ftt tokens floating and as the supply expands the number of holders or the capital that's bound up in a token has to expand at the same rate in order for the price to just stay flat that's what happened at the beginning we also see that the number of medium-sized retail and the number of whale wallets increased not as quickly though nowadays there is no circulating Supply issue anymore 93% has already been issued and it's question about if any additional tokens will be issued because again the centralized exchange that underpins this token is now defun let's check out what happened to the number of holders in the last month so where the price went up by 177% we pretty much went sideways for most of the time here are the same charts just for the last month so each data point here is an hour we can look at the last 30 days again retail accumulated mediumsized retail as well the whales as well slightly it's not massive accumulation it's from 1,00 420 holders to 1,500 holders but still given that this is still a dead project by a defunct exchange that's pretty impressive and so I believe Whenever there will be positive news around FTX again around the bankruptcy proceedings then of course the price will shoot up again similar to Dogecoin right when Dogecoin gets tweeted by Elon Musk then the price shoots up and what usually happens is that subsequently the price bleeds again at least relative to ethereum so what I believe makes a lot of sense is to simply just look at where is potentially currently a floor and after the massive collapse that happened in April of 2023 right then we simply just went sideways most of the time there wasn't too much risk anymore in holding ftt relative to ethereum and then when positive news come then we get our nice relies in this case 250% almost but then we bleed again now we got positive news again let's see how longer this can last but at some point the r will die as well and then I believe we will continue to bleed again until we go to a certain floor when there's no more bleed relative to ethereum then it might make sense to buy even a dead project simply because sometimes there are still good news so if you want to plot a chart like this right and you want to look at the relative valuation to ethereum this is I

let's have a look whether or not it makes sense to buy this Bottom now because in the end it's a game of buying low and selling high and obviously right now the wif token is relatively low now in this video in order to answer this question we are going to look at onchain data we are going to look at data most people are not considering we are not just drawing random lines on charts we're actually looking at what are the whales doing what is retail doing how's the market in general developing right now so here a quick refresher dog with head is currently at $184 and had temporarily a market cap of almost 5 billion now we are below 2 billion we've seen nothing but declining prices since the end of March and is there maybe a bottom forming here now why should we look at do with head in the first place of course because it's one of the major meme coins across all Chains It's at number four in terms of market cap still Dogecoin is more than eight times the size on the Solana chain when ordering by liquidity pool size do with head is the fourth largest token so still a lot of trading happens directly on chain this is not just trading on centralized exchanges now the price action of dog with head has to be seen in the General market environment right when all of crypto is going up then do with f is going up as well with leverage and vice versa so the problem is unfortunately that all of crypto isn't doing too well and we can see this very nicely across chains looking at the total value locked so check this out this column over here this is the one month change in total value locked for various chains Solana is the fourth largest chain and it saw its total value lock decreasing by 11% in the last month there's pretty much only red over here the only chain that has positive momentum at the moment is the ton chain so the VL for Solana dropped by 11% in 1 month dog with head though dropped by 44% in 1 month so yes there is inherent leverage in altcoins but 44% versus 11% that's quite a difference is there maybe something going on that most people are not aware of I believe there is something let's have a look at the number of whale investors on chain so I've built a tool to count the number of wallets based on a minimum holding threshold and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 500 dog with hatch tokens so at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail so long-term retail tends to be accumulating and rarely sells in aggregate in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now 5,000 tokens or almost $10,000 here we've seen a lot of accumulation in December of last year and since then the holding isn't really changing much for those medium-sized holders of course December of last year was still a very nice time to get into the token now on the right side we see the big problem this is the wallets that matter by far the most this is the whale wallets this is the wallets that have at least 50,000 tokens so the Wallets on the right are 100 times more important than the Wallets on the left and so the accumulation here really doesn't matter that much when the number of whales gets cut by 25% rough in the last 6 months the whales continue to take profit they continue to sell off and that's the reason why the price is having such a hard time when the overal market is not expanding I believe the underperformance of dog with head in the last month is due to the Wales selling off and it doesn't look like they're stopping it looks like this is a very constant bleed and there's still a lot of those wallets left now why is the market in egot doing so poorly I believe it's because no more fiat currency is flowing in here are some major stable coins added together the market cap of D usdt usdc of B USD when we add all of those together we can see that since end of April of this year there's actually no more stable coin printing going on so in agregate there are not more people depositing their Fiat on centralized exchanges that then send it over to say tether that then print the token compared to people that cash out so we are now clearly in a player play versus player Market before we had an expanding market and so it was existing players versus new players now it's existing player versus existing player it's much harder to make money this way and when no more money is flowing in since April of this year and dog with hat has a hard time expanding in market cap as well also since April of this year by the way now let's have a look at that chart historically again the stablecoin market caps and when they increase we tend to be in a bull market when we go sideways then the alt coins already tend to bleed when we are going down then of course everything is going down including Bitcoin and ethereum this here this big crash was the teral Luna collapse this is when the anchor protocol went belly up then we actually don't have that much more time but I don't actually believe that we're going to see simply just the same development again but still this is not good for altcoins especially for the risky altcoins where the whales tend to sell on top of that we've also got more and more manipulation going on unfortun Ely some trading volume happens on binance as well so that's 27% of all of trading volume we've also got levered bets on the price now Perpetual Futures they are used quite a bit as well almost 1 billion of trading volume in the last 24 hours so you can hear from the tone of this video that I'm not necessarily a fan of buying dog with head I used to cover the wif token very early on this channel when there was still a rising price and at that time things looked okay now now unfortunately we have this double wemy here right we've got the selling by the Wales and we've got General crypto not expanding I personally approach this Market a bit differently now instead of trying to find the one or two alt coins that might outperform I'm simply betting on falling prices when most altcoins underperform why not just bet on most altcoins doing worse this is one of those altcoins that I'm shorting I'm making very consistent gains with this since beginning of the year we went down by almost 60% and yes there is a little bit volatility but it's really not that noteworthy compared to other charts right when you can make money when this continues to go down then why not bet on this why try to pick this one needle in the hze deck right it makes no sense I've talked about how to short assets like this how to find assets like this in the premium membership so that's down below that's the Bitcoin tray.com there's a 42 minute tutorial video and of course in premium I also discuss what assets make sense to Short and of course I also reveal what this asset here is so if you've got roughly $3,000 or so to put on this bet you should get premium for free right this is the kind of magnitude you have to be dealing with if your crypto portfolio is just a few hundred then it makes no sense but if you've got 7,000 in crypto and you can put 3,000 on this bet you should get premium for free there's no guarantee in anything in investing but at least that's what I personally do right I bet on this continuing to fall I will continue to make updates on various mem coins on this channel incl including doc with hat if you don't want to miss those videos feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this a like it will help the channel grow if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify

Baron Network around the airdrop 4 days ago a deep dive on Fundamentals by invest answers and look no further one day ago even coin buau talking about it piff here being in the title now I'm not going to bore you with the content that you've already seen I'm not just going to read from the website the tldr is that piff is a dat Oracle directly competing with chain link but as said there are more than enough videos on the fundamentals of piff we are going to look at the things that really matter how much developer activity is there how many transactions are being made how many fees are being generated what's the supply schedule as in how much new additional Supply will hit the market potentially de pressing the price we're going to look at the drivers of supply and demand which in the end should result in the price first data point you probably haven't seen yet what's the developer activity this is GitHub and the team is working frantically on this one change to the code base 1 hour ago another one 5 hours ago 11 hours ago people are working on this nonstop but the big question is always about valuation how fair is piff currently valued and for that we can simply look at how many fees are being generated the the fees measured in s so tokens let's be super optimistic let's let go with the very favorable assumption that every day from now on we will see 168 so tokens being generated in fees every day so that's not the current state right the average is lower but simply let's work with the Positive case 168 * 55.3 that's a daily fee generation of $9,300 roughly and let's multiply this by the days of the year $3.4 million us in fees now there is this idea in traditional Finance of a PE ratio right of a price to earnings ratio and let's take those 3.4 Millions as earnings and let's multiply this with a PE of say 30 that's also comparatively generous doing that gives us a fair valuation of piff of 100 million roughly now what's the market cap currently 620 million fully diluted even 4.3 billion we're going to look at the dilution later so off the B we can already say that the market is pricing in a lot of future growth we already made an assumption of roughly three times the current average revenue remain Assumption of a 30p ratio and still we get an overvaluation of 6X just with the non-diluted market cap now crypto isn't just about fair valuations right crypto is about narratives and one reason why piff is doing so well is because Solana did very well recently and of course piff was an airdrop on the Solana chain what you're seeing over here here is the so price relative to the ethereum price so this is not the US dollar chart this is Solana in eeve and in the last roughly 80 days we saw an outperformance versus Eve of 143% thus a lot of assets on Solana are now outperforming Bonk for example mcoin Bonk being one of them I made a video on Bon just recently feel free to check it out on this channel now seeing Solana outperforming that much is actually quite surprising given that the total value locked the Capital locked on the chain is not increasing that much this is the total value locked in US Dollars and here is the total value locked in s so tokens so even measured in the native token itself we don't see more defi usage and that's again defi Lama measuring across several decentralized apps here's the number of monthly successful non-vote Solana transactions also it's not necessarily increased adoption it's not necessarily increased usage so it appears as if piff is simply one hype built on top of another hype two Hypes Levering on top of each other creating all of that performance creating all of the tension especially with that airdrop I will tell you why I think we can ignore a lot of the fundamentals like what kind of price feeds it has or how it deres those price feeds via regression over all of those different data providers or how the data Oracle Market is really centralized there's only chain link and all competitors have very very little market cap Tor being the second largest but that's also mainly due to manipulation of the price on the derivatives Market made another video on tell on trb as well actually several of them feel free to check them out as well I think one of the main reasons why piff is doing so well is because it has so much support by the centralized exchanges look at where you can trade this this is the spot Market it's available everywhere and this is the derivatives Market you can also trade this everywhere 105 million of per trading volume on binance alone another 7 24 million on bit another 45 million okx and the funding rates are not too extreme in either direction so in other words there's no real consensus no real Market consensus if this is now an inflated price or if this is relatively low this is super good for the centralized exchanges because they don't have to hatch their bets and they make all of those trading fees with the PBS we are currently in altcoin season and with altcoin season comes a lot of very strong outperformance and especially when centralized exchanges push the as well with their derivatives contracts this can go on for a while the main point here is for a while not forever because the Oracle Market is incredibly hard to disrupt because reliability of data is super important why do you need those oracles you need them for example for borrowing and lending platforms so that the borrowing and lending platform can estimate how much is your collateral worth now if you deposit collateral on a defi platform and you borrow against this and the value of your collateral is not estimated the right way maybe the value is overestimated then you could just deposit a lot of that and drain the whole pool you could drain the entire protocol from their funds because you can simply just deposit all of that mispriced collateral and pull out everything in other words a positive track record is super important and you don't just play around with your price Oracle simply because so much is hanging on this one simple buck one simple programming error even if it's just temporary can completely destroy your protocol so as said I believe this really can continue with the centralized exchange support but long term there is a problem especially when we look at the token unlocks check this out we currently have 1.5 billion piff but one year from now this will more than double so if the demand of piff tokens will not more than double within the next year and the price will go down and these kind of cliffs we have several times now this is bad for piff long-term holders if piff cannot instantly take away all of the that market share from chain link which is highly likely but it might be good again for the centralized exchanges because what happens during Cliff unlocks like this a lot of people will be betting on falling prices with the derivatives contracts on those centralized exchanges one year from now a lot of people will see that the supply will increase a lot of videos will be done around this people will buy the shorts will bet on the falling prices and then the centralized exchanges can squeeze all of those shorts they can buy up more and more of the token generating nice nice liquidation fees as well did I promise you too much that you will see things here

#departmentofgovefficiency #doge","do the department of government efficiency that mem coin is it just a pump and dump we're currently in a crash does it make sense to buy this low let's have a look at some onchain metrics to try to figure out if there is some kind of manipulation going on or if there's actual real adoption and they're simply just profit taking now here's the chart it's not the prettiest in the world and we're currently at 39 Cent per do which is a trending token on the Solana chain now the first explanation for a crash like this could could simply be that the election is now over attention might be shifting Trump has won the prise of that profit taking is surprising though now doesn't make sense to buy the website does not have information about this we want to look at data most people aren't looking at we want to see the onchain analytics and so on the Solana chain there's more than 10,000 wallets that hold Doge at the same time there are 3,000 subscribers on telegram but here's something surprising there's only 800 followers on the xplatform on Twitter shouldn't a meme coin that's closely related to Elon Musk have way more Twitter followers especially when the number of holders on the Solana chain are more than 10,000 now let's have a look at those holders let's have a look at the number of retail investors versus whale investors so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 300 Doge tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now 3,000 tokens or $10,000 for of the token on the right side we've got $100,000 worth of the token now we can see how retail is adopting over time we can also see how the Wales did dump quite a bit we can also see that today a lot of tokens got transacted we see an all-time high in the traded volume now for small retail that's not an all-time high it's for medium retail and large retail so the whales are depressing the price now things are a bit strange right we have seen more than 10,000 holders on the Solana chain and we just look at the number of traders in the last 24 hours then we seeing 39,000 buyers and 8,000 sellers so a lot of wallets that simply just buy and sell all the time and this is congruent with the history just have a look at this most trades happen from wallets without a star a star means a new wallet no star means an existing wallet so a lot of wash trading going on now on the face of it the charts over here should be positive they show that the small ret wallets tend to hold a lot of the supply normally we do not see that normally we don't see 23% held by wallets that have less than ,000 in it we don't see 43% holding the rest normally we see the Wales holding much more and when we look at the value that's held by those different wallet cohorts we also see a quite nice even split but when we then dig deeper things are really not pretty have a look at the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders over time we have seen days where there was half a million of new wallets trading the token on Solana some days we see 20,000 other days we see 222,000 those are simply just wallets that buy the token and afterwards sell it again another hint that there is a lot of wash trading going on and it looks like the number of wallets that hold the token are also getting artificially inflated have a look at this on the right we've already seen how there's more than 10,000 holders on the Solana chain and it seems like there has been massive influx of new holders in just the last 2 days however once we adjust for the minimum holding of 300 tokens we don't see that growth at all there a little bit of growth but the curve looks very very different to what we've got over here right where we simply just went sideways and then suddenly saw another rush and so that's why I like onchain analytics so much we can really see what's going on under the hood we don't just look at Price charts we don't have to wait until we get rock pulled we can actually see the red flags directly in the numbers and when there's only 10,000 holders but there were days where half a million different wallets interacted with the token things do not add up and so crypto is really a game of both luck and skill and with skill we can determine what kind of meme coins are pure scams pure rock poles and we can find out what kind of meme coins might potentially get some traction for example I like to track influencer wallets and over here we've got influencer Kyle chesse that bought the goat token on the 14th of October for 14 cents so that was over here since then the price went up by almost 500% I have a look at this the Frog token also bought by Kyle Chessie that was on the day of launch that went up by more than 3,000% now it's not just Kyle chesse that we are tracking even though we do have quite a few wallets of his to be more exact we've got 12 of his wallets in total though we track more than 400 wallets so that's by various influencers that's by top Traders that's where I get my Alpha from and so there's a dedicated video course on how to find influencer Wallets on how to then afterwards track them and how to then subsequently interpret the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total feel free to check it out it's part of Premium down below the bitcoin.com but there's more than 100 videos in total also on onchain analytics what we did in this video or on other things like Risk Management portfolio diversification Etc we discuss our wallet findings in dedicated telegram groups and we discuss our trading signals also in dedicated altcoin chat groups so feel free to check it out it's $125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so there's zero risk for you if you do not like it just message me within the first s days and I'll ref front you 100% so I am personally staying away from the Doge token there is way too much manipulation going on there's nothing natural happening here if you got some value out this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42gan7816ZA,"['Solana', 'JUST',

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!,"if you've been sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the absolute perfect time to buy Caspa the chart in front of you is screaming saying bye me now and I'll explain to you exactly why this might be the perfect time to either add to your Caspa bag or get exposure for the very first time we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about some of the important things that are happening and why one exchange is going all in on not just Caspa but krc2 tokens which exchanges that and how can you use it to make money with Caspa and K we'll talk about that in this video before I get going make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel if you haven't already let's start with the Caspa industrial initiative this thing I don't think it gets the headlines and the coverage that it deserves because what key is doing I think holds the key pun intended to mass institutional adoption globally of Caspa and the entire network so this is from their ex handle from key kaspa's uh in Enterprise event we introduce the following primary projects number one warp core number two gigawatt stablecoin and number three zet SLX so videos are also on YouTube I will link this exact post so you can go watch the video and read it in more detail if you'd like to but to kind of cover this thing in a nutshell warp core is an ISO compliance layer linking Caspa to the financial world for Global settlements now this is a big one remittances we've had people like Mark yuso talk about this all the time this is going to be one of the largest and key drivers of crypto and blockchain adoption in the next 5 to 10 years as the payment system is completely overhauled and what better way to do it than on a proof of work chain who in just a few short months is going to be able to process 10 blocks per second that is one thing that the key initiative is working on the second thing is the gigawatt stable coin which is a stable coin specifically designed for the energy sector and the last one is the zero emission energy trading exchange again they go into complete detail in the video of this post I will drop that link in the description of this video so a lot of exciting things that key is doing also what they're doing and what I love about this is is they're targeting a niche and you take a look at this one here from Key caspen Enterprise the same one that we just shared those three events from introducing Cass Union our pilot project to revolutionize Credit Unions worldwide by integrating them into Caspa empowering Cooperative Finance with digital Innovation C Union will uh will digitize the credit union movement Credit Unions they say the heartbeats of community Finance are still analog in a digital world let's upgrade them together cast Union which aims to bring the global credit union movement into the digital age uh they talk about how credit unions already embody decentralization as they are cooperatives owned and controlled by their members who act as both shareholders and customers 360 million members across 118 countries they provide a democratic Financial system where each member has an equal voice in decisions however many credit unions particularly in developing regions face challenges such as outdated systems High operational costs and limited access to Capital C Union brings them into the digital age uh of possibilities so I like the fact that it's not just a broad net yeah we're going to bring the entire banking system on caspo or on the caspo network they're targeting a very Niche sector of that banking system being the credit unions and it makes complete sense with everything I just read in this post so shout out to the Caspa industrial Initiative for getting this thing going so this is something that I'm going to be keeping my eye on um maybe not just here in the US but globally as well lot of exciting things are happening now I want to take a look at some metrics from cast. FYI you can see here in real time the transactions per second the blocks per second when the next reduction of the tokens are going to be and all the live transactions that are getting posted on this website here as well we take a look at the top addresses that hold Caspa one thing that I think is very positive that we're seeing is we're seeing a shift away from the sharp the whale the humpback right these these wallets that own a massive amount of Caspa and we're seeing a large inflow into the more smaller account addresses right the ones that hold between 100 and, Caspa that is up 71 over 7,100 wallets in the last 30 days 1,800 of those coming in just the last week we take a look at the wallets that hold between 1,000 and 10,000 Caspa over the last 30 days 1762 and over the last 7 Days 220 uh and so this is an excellent resource for all you Caspa Fanatics to look at as far as how decentralized are the wallet addresses and and what's the breakdown of how many wallets hold how many tokens then I want to go to the KRC 20 tokens you can see here there are currently little over 900 KC tokens we know V2 of the cplex KC Tok token standard when live extremely successful you can see here on the bottom 926 total tokens with 31.1 million in total transfer you can see here a lot of them have 10,000 plus holders including the top one here which is nacho which has a current market cap of around $40 million now nacho is obviously the hottest meme coin not just by metrics but by social metrics as well this is W borski's cat uh and so this thing has been extremely successful with over 16,700 holders and an exciting piece of news for all you nacho Fanatics and the people that hold a nacho token is it is officially been listed on a US regulated exchange and that is none other than px. us is proud to be the first US regulated exchange that has already listed Caspa and we are fully committed to supporting the growth of the krc2 ecosystem Nacho the highest market cap project in the Caspa ecosystem is the first kc20 project to partner with pionex us for the vote to list initiatives we're excited to continue supporting the kc20 ecosystem through future to uh future vote to list opportunities and look forward to Nacho's continued growth now why is this important right for for one like they like I mentioned here they are a fully regulated us exchange they're available in 47 states with an aim to get to all 50 states in the very short term their fees are extremely low and guys let me tell you I've been in personal contact with these people they are all in on your on your project they're all in on Caspa they're all in on not just Caspa but the krc2 tokens and so for me I created account a while ago if you haven't done so I would highly highly recommend create an account be one of the first people that when these kc20 tokens go live on an exchange you can support it you can go buy it you can sell it you can trade it you can build Bots around it which I'll get into here in a second speaking of bots one thing I do want to focus on today with pionex is their grid trading bot and how people who've used it for Caspa have made over 50% in the last seven days I'll talk about that but first just a brief overview of what the hell is a grit trading bot right Bots are the the new thing right I don't have the time to sit there and look at when Caspa goes down when should I buy when Caspa goes up when should I buy or when should I sell right you want even it out while there's things such as Bots and the grid trading BR I think is a great strategy for you to add to your Caspa bags without worrying about losing out on the downside or losing out on the upside and not catching the downside now why using grid bot here from pionex you can see uh $1,000 hold for a year in this example you would have lost around $25 if you use a grid bot which essentially takes an algorithm and buys the lows and sells the highs and continues to accumulate your bag you would have been up over $400 now this is extremely low risk but very high reward so you see it has two things right it has the orders and the range you set you can either set the parameter range yourself which I'll link this as well so you can take a look at the stepbystep guide and video of how to do that or they already have parameters in there just tell them how much money you want to you want to put in it's 100 bucks 50 bucks 1,000 bucks whatever that amount is the algorithm will automatically do that for you and this is all the steps again I'll link this in there so you guys can take a look but uh as far as an explanation so after the bot is created successfully the order will buy a certain percentage of the spot at the current price and place sell orders above the current price the bot will keep a certain percentage of usdt to place buy orders below the current price the B will automatically Buy Low and sell high within the price range and accumulate the grit profit 247 when the price rises in this example 100,000 USD or Falls below 10,000 usdt in this example the strategy will be suspended when the price goes back into that range the bot will continue uh if the price gets out of the upper L the the bot will stop so if for some reason you put let's say you do a Casper grid trading B you do 10 cents to 20 cents that's a pretty big range if it falls below 10 cents the bot will stop once it gets into that 10 to 20 cent range it'll continue to do what it's doing now if you're like all right it's a little complicated I like the idea of making money but I don't know how to set it up easy peasy guess guess what take a look here they already have a Caspa grid strategy all you got to do is create an account go through the kyc verification because they are fully regulated US exchange and all you got to do is here just click copy click copy the amount of money you want to put in if you are a a micromanager you can go in here and you can manually edit the parameters yourself and say look I believe the absolute floor for Caspa is 11 cents and I believe the upper limit I want to trade Within is around 16 cents you can you can change those yourself or you can go directly to the copy strategy and you can start copying these grid generators that other people have created or you can go with what they have in place as well and again this is all available on pionex super low fees and we're proud to have them as a partner of the Sin City crypto channel uh that link will be in the description and pinned to the comment section as well I want to get back to key then I'll get back to the Chart I showed you earlier uh the other thing at the Enterprise event this Enterprise event was amazing um a lot of things to cover so key Academy is a Launchpad to transform in uh innovative ideas into real world Solutions if you're a startup development team seeking seed funding and mentorship or an enterprise Enterprise exploring Caspa block dag integration key Academy has you covered this is interesting here we are exploring a KRC 20t standard which T stands for trusted where every project is certified and thoroughly vetted with technical audits compliance checks and background reviews to maintain transparency and Trust I can't begin explain to you how absolutely massive this is imagine all the coins in the salana in the ethereum in list any layer one ecosystem that you want to buy but maybe you're not technically Savvy enough to do the research and say okay the liquidity is locked uh this person controls this much uh has the contract been renounced is this a Honeypot when you have that te next to your token standard on Caspa you know that the some of the smartest people in the world have done that for you and it eliminates a lot of the dumb risks that a lot of people unfortunately have to face and end up losing money so this is something again super exciting uh I would recommend you guys go follow this account uh Caspa kii uh you get all the updates on here and of course we will continue to give the updates here on Sin City crypto so make sure you are subscribed let's go back to the Chart I showed you very earlier and why this chart is screaming to you buy me now I'm Caspa buy me we take a look where is price at now currently at 13.18 if we throw a Fibonacci retracement on here and we take the move we got from around that 10.58 all the way up to our high of around 20 cents you can see as I draw this out we are almost perfectly aligned on our support Zone with the 786 Fibonacci level so we've given back around 78.6% of the move we saw going all the way back to May of this year but I also want to use I want to get rid of these trend lines and I want to throw on the price action Concepts here from Lux algo now we are seeing a little bit of Divergence here on the bottom so we see money flow this is our liquidity flow index we know the money flow is continuing to go up in a positive direction but sentiment is going down so this is called a Divergence now this either the flows are going to go out which price is going down but money's continuing to flow in you have a Divergence there as well something is bound to break and if I'm taking a look at this chart and I'm saying okay well is it going to break to the to the negative or is it going to break to the positive we take a look at okay price is at the Fibonacci 786 level we have it at a key support level we also have it right at our discount Zone which the last two times Caspa went into the Zone the last one was on this massive liquidation Wick all the way down to 12.45 and Casper rallied up to 17.7 cents shortly thereafter we also had a brief Wick just yesterday down here and price reacted very positively immediately moving to the upside and flipping from red to Green well guess where we are now my friends we are currently right above this discount zone now if you want to be the meticulous I have to wait for the exact Penny to hit for me to enter or exit a market sure you can wait from currently at 13.18 to 12.92% uh we know the liquidity is getting there the hash rate is continuing to grow krc2 tokens are taken off we have exchange listings left and right we have the key initiative Making Waves globally I I just I I don't know if you've been sitting on the sidelines um of course this is not Financial advice but uh Caspa is one that I would definitely not sleep on if you enjoy this video make sure to come check out our live show Monday through Friday at 2 p PM Eastern Standard time we'll see you the next

token we have in the world we are just one breakout away from uh reaching the top if you draw the graph uh if you check the graph in forour time frame and draw okay from here draw a trend line to explain you man it Formed double top the most various flag uh this is one of the highlights so we need like one closing above it which will not happen at the moment but if you see if you see closing Above This level if we see closing Above This price going to pump non stop fine but we have bigger um like time frame as well one time frame when we check the gra previously from this level that was 83 84 it dropped and today itself got the rejection man that's why it's coming down if I draw a horizontal Ray to explain you man see this how beautifully it played out it tried breaking it tried breaking but could not break how it it was 100% perfect so how we should it got the rejection why it got the rejection purely because previously it tried one a time frame previously it tried man previously it tried breaking this level could not break so it dropped massively today itself it tried now it need closing now it'll be back it's coming down it it's coming down it'll be fluctuating after that again going to try and once we see closing like this after that price is going to break no if you don't see closing closing man it'll be trying again after after like after some hours if it don't break it'll be back again and then again it going to try again it going to try like this but once we see closing like this closing Above This level above 83 when to buy PR take a trade at 86 cents nobody in the world will resist you hold you that don't buy no people will say that buy good to go after 83 Cent 85 886 good to go buy and make the most money out of it it's one of the final but before that before breakout if you are taking a trade nobody taught you the basics you are new guy who want to buy I I'll I'll buy I going to put the money I going to make money in the market no way you will lose you are a loser Man without knowledge without experience you are buying something and you think money will like follow you no of course not once you will make money with your luck twice you will make money with your luck third time once it goes against you you'll like lose all of your profits which you made with luck and then you will be losing money as well and then you will have that regret oh I want to recover my money then you will have that and then when you will come in that uh loophole of loss loss loss loss you are dead man then you will be taking wrong trades again and again I don't want any of that to happen man uh in all my videos anyone who watched my content they have made money in the market why because we play professionally before we Deep dive into PR fundamentally technically price prediction everything I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market or do you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I have been doing crypto for 10 years now I have a VIP two trades daily signals daily profit we bought ra Y 0.17 what what happened since we bought this token Ray r a y since we bought Ray today it hit the to $5 your $1,000 you could have turned into literally $330,000 in profit that's why I say best in the world why because Bitcoin Bitcoin we bought 3 years back from now BTC 19,000 nobody was talking about Bitcoin we we took a trade in Bitcoin we are sitting in like 3x sorry 4X Prof in Bitcoin as well anyone who watched my content who joined the VIP VIP thing is a really big huge man haven't joined the VIP on the screen DM me I'll be adding you all the information about crypto daily signals Buy price sell price complete guidance on my VIP right now let's come back to top how we should go after after breakout man after breakout B 85 Cent is good to that's the only buying level we have or else we have to buy less than 30 cents if I remove this level you can take a trade over here at 85 that's the first level or or or maybe if it won't break it'll be back to 30 cents and less than that but it going to break just wait for some time it going to break we are in a bull market now it already made the new alltime high Bitcoin so yeah let's talk about few fundamental part of this token which really makes an impact in the market PR o because it's a big one man Prosper just a bit of it $24 million of market cap volume is like fourth time the market cap that's that's a real 34 million coins we have in the market extremely low Dow yeah binance g ixe almost available everywhere in the world I wish you all the best price prediction we have for prosper for short term it going to pump up to $10 and for

millionaires welcome back to the channel in this video we are going to do some quick technical analysis on spell token but before we begin make sure that you join my telegram group there is a link in the description below this is where I post all the trading setups and ideas that I am looking at every single day before I talk about them on YouTube AI tokens minan coins gaming projects aing all that good stuff can be found on my telegram group it's free for now but it's not going to be free forever guys so make sure that you join as soon as possible also please do me a solid and subscribe to the YouTube channel click the like button let's get straight into it as you see here on coin market cap spell token is currently rank 369 the price is at 0.397 10.78% up for the day and the market capup is sitting right below 150 million at 147 million to be exact so there is a lot of potential upside here if we zoom out at the old times CH here on coin market cap we see that this token has experienced another bull run before in 2021 when it reached the all-time high of 0.031 since then the price action pulled back because people took profits and we've been in accumulation phase since then so we are currently at range lows and this is what we do in this channel guys we buy range lows we sell range highs before we look at the chart on trading you let's look at what is spell token real quick spell is a reward token associated with abadaba money a lending platform that uses interest bearing tokens as collateral to borrow a USD pegged stable coin called Magic internet money M Ababa uses the Cassi lending technology pioneered by Susi swap to provide isolated lending markets that allow users to adjust their risk tolerance according to the collateral they decide to use this is their X account you can find it at mimore spell borrow leverage or earn yield enjoy the magic they have a Discord you can click on this link and join and they have a website you can find it at Ababa money they have been pretty active on X posting almost every single day the most recent post was 6 hours ago look what it says 190% base apy and 29.9 X posium farming as you see here they have over 120,000 followers so there is some kind of community behind them this is the chart on trading view we are looking at spell USD one day chart on binance if we zoom out we see that the alltime high here on binance is all the way up here at 0.028 and it occurred on December of 2021 since then spell has lost over 95% of its value now at range lows we you see that there is a double bottom pattern going on recently on March or February of 2024 spell experienced a nice run all the way up to 0.0019 around that time the crypto Market as a whole experienced a mini bull run the fact that spell run along with the rest of the crypto Market is a very good sign because it shows that spell follows the rest of the crypto market and therefore that's a very good indication that next time the crypto Market pumps or experiences a mini bu run or a full-blown Bull Run spell is going to run along with it at least it's very possible as you see now the price action is testing this Fibonacci level that's located at 0.393 we are currently above it so what we want to see is a bounce here we want to see the price action closing above and staying above this price level however because this Fibonacci level has been acting as a key psychological level of resistance in the past for example look at this here you the price action tried to break above it but we pulled back down we might see something like that again nobody knows so if the price price action pulls back there are two things that might happen or we are going to put a higher low and then continue moving straight to the upside or we might experience an even deeper pull back all the way down here slowly at this key level of support that's located at 03036 nobody can predict the future you can't time the market so how I play with these pullbacks is I wait for red candles to come in and then I scale in slowly for example if I have $1,000 to invest into this token I might buy a $100 here $100 here $100 here if it pumps again a little bit $100 here okay so I spread out my bu eventually the price action is going to break Above This Fibonacci level sometime in the future so all these small buys are going to be profitable in my view since we are currently at range lows anywhere we buy inside this rangle that's ranging between 0.336 and 0.397 is a very good buy a very nice buying opportunity in the long term what I don't want to see is the price action breaking below this ke level of support that's located at 0.336 if we break below that things are going to turn bearish and I would proba exit all my positions there is no point at least in my view to hold downtrends like that but as long as the price action stays above it we should be fine the next Fibonacci level that I have here on the chart is located at 0.12 the measured move from the current price levels to this Fibonacci level is a 37% move the next Fibonacci level is located at 0.0015 and the measured move from the current price level is approximately a 70% move and the last Fibonacci level that I have here on the chart that's also the recent high that we saw in March of 2024 which is located at 0.19 the measured move from the current price level to that recent High that's over a 100% move so we can double our money if the price action stays above and bounces here and continues to moving higher and higher if we see a pullback of course the measured move is going to be even greater for example if we see a higher low that move to the recent High high that we saw in March that's almost a 200% move depending on where you start to measure the move if we see a pullback all the way down here at this key level of support of 0.336 the measured move to the recent high is over a 4X move 429 per. so people who bought this token all the way down here or here are going to make over 4% when spell gets that price level of 0.19 that's why we love pullbacks guys we love buying red in this channel I never buy green I only buy red candles I'm going to give you a very conservative price prediction for spell for 2025 as you might know 80 to 90% of all the projects in crypto never reach that previous alltime High during a second bullrun therefore for now I am not going to give you a price prediction surpassing that previous alltime High I'm going to give you a price prediction that makes more sense for example I think that during a full-blown Bull Run spell can reach a price level of 0.44 that's a measured move of 1,1 126% from the bottom from the ski support located at 0.336 from the current price level to this price target of 0.44 that's at 378 per. if spell an just to run all the way up here at this price level of 0.44 it's going to have a market cap of 600 70 million approximately let me know in the comments below what is your price prediction for spell for 2025 do you think that it can surpass that previous alltime high that we saw in 2021 that's all I have for you today guys thanks for watching I'll see you on the next one a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o8VhG2WBMo,"['JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-o8VhG2WBMo/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-29T03:19:54Z

Price, Near Protocol Price Prediction, Near Protocol longterm, Near Protocol Tokenomics,  #near #nearprotocol #crypto",NE protocol is one of the OG tokens and it's the definition of the up and down roller coaster in cryptand let's have a look at what's causing those pumps and dumps let's try to find out using onchain data if we are up for another pump or if we're rather dumping again so this is near in US Dollars on a linear scale and here's the same on a logarithmic scale we've seen relies from bottom to top of 3700% but we've also seen bare mark markets of 95% of course some of this is due to the overall crypto market so let's look at relative valuations let's look at the idiosyncratic movements what we've got over here is the near price relative to bitcoin and since October of 2020 near underperformed Bitcoin by 35% and it's very interesting how this bottomed in October of this year at very similar levels to where it bottomed in December of 2020 this bottom is not that obvious on the US do denominated chart here we've got near relative to ethereum also long-term a slight underperformance 44% and even though this looks problematic because buying neara is obviously more risky than buying Bitcoin in ethereum and we did not get compensated for that risk we didn't see outperformance even though that's not so nice I think that this underperformance might come to a stop because the fundamental reason I believe for the worst performance and for those dumps that we have seen several times in the price I believe the reason is in token inflation the number of near tokens went from 28 million to currently 1.1 billion so at more than 5x the circulating Supply grew massively and when the token only underperforms by 30 to 40% when the supply is more than 5 Xing that actually shows that there is quite some growing demand the question is of course will that demand continue to grow as the token infl goes down now Nia's main usage is decentralized finance it's Defi and defi had a massive runup in 2021 this is the def5 market as a whole and then it imploded in 2022 so that was due to FDX and due to Terra Luna we have then seen again a Resurgence beginning in October of last year and now things are weakening Now isn't that chart early similar to the near price denominated in Bitcoin that also botom in October of last year and it also peaked in April May of this year I don't think that's coincidence I believe there is a strong link between the money that's flowing into crypto through the Fiat system and crypto prices and defi adoption what we've got over here is the stable coin market cap on ethereum because most stable coins are only one to one redeemable on ethereum they do get bridged over to other chains but if you want to redeem your us usdc you have to do this from the ethereum chain and this continued to contract up until October of last year then it rose again and then the rise stopped in April of this year now we're just going sideways and if you're not expanding in crypto then people rather go risk off which makes sense right you only want to take on a lot of risk if you get the return and so this is defy as a whole and this is the total value locked on the near chain those are very similar charts again bottoming out and peing at very similar times and so if the momentum currently isn't that great if no additional money is flowing into crypto is Nia at least a good value play is it relatively speaking cheap so what's the market cap relative to the total value locked let's look at the comparison So currently we've got $200 million worth on near chain the fully diluted market cap is at 4.8 billion and so when we look at that relationship market cap really relative to total value locked then the near chain is over here at 22 22 unfortunately is rather on the higher side there is cardano and ton which is more expensive so ton is at 35 cardano is at 63 but if you just compare this to the majority of other chains of course Bitcoin doesn't count because Bitcoin isn't really used that much for defi there's only the ordinals over here if you just look at that relationship for most chains 22 is rather expensive the market is pricing in that nearest total value locked can outgrow the total value locked of other chains will that happen your guess is as good as mine I'm personally rather cautious right I want to see crypto as a whole expanding to get into risk on projects again the token inflation isn't terrible anymore we are probably not going to see a crash that's comparable to Prior crashes but I'm not sure how much potential upside there is is Nia really able to attract that much Capital to outgrow the rest of crypto in a market that's stagnating that's the big question I'm trying to be as objective as possible on this channel I try to not bash cryptos I also don't try to Hype them I simply just share the data if you appreciate this feel free to give this video a like feel free to also

#beercoin #memecoin #crypto","the beer coin meme on the Solana chain had a massive roller coaster we covered beer coin very early on this channel more on this later now the price has crashed down again the question is does it make sense to buy this dip is this an opportunity to buy low and sell high or is this simply just throwing good money after bad money let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people aren't considering so here's how I covered beer coin on this channel there was a video 18 days ago it outperformed a regular video another video followed that was 2 weeks ago one more around 12 days ago it still gets search volume and that was when the price was at14 cents then at17 cents and then at 34 C and so that's the beer coin roller coaster we talked about beer coin early the price went up above 5 cents to 5.5 cents now it crashed back down to18 and so does it make sense to buy this dip given that we are very close to the original prices I like to look at onchain data I like to look at what are the Wales doing what is retail doing how much interest is there currently in bcoin now first let's have a look at the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders because if there's more more firsttime Traders jumping on a token that means that the token investor base is growing that means that the price tends to grow we had a massive influx of new Traders up until the 26th of May so that was before the coinbase listing so that was purchases over here in this region and the price subsequently still did a 6X almost then we had pretty equal trading then we had another massive influx of firsttime Traders on the 5th of June the 5th of June was over here and again the price almost doubled from there we then had massive activity of recurring Traders on the 13th of June the 13th of June was over here and subsequently the price fell by more than 50% so far we don't see a Revival of first-time Traders it's still the recurring traders that are dominating trading and that means existing investors in the token taking profit or potentially also locking in their losses now there's an interesting pattern regarding the time of the day so this is hourly candles and this shows us the number of firsttime Traders by trading hour and we tend to see very low numbers around midnight UTC time zone so we see that over here on the 14th we also see this over here on the 15th and the 16th is not that different so let's have a look at the prices at midnight UTC so have a look at this this is over here we are at a low point at the price at midnight UTC let's have a look at this also rather at the lower end of the trading range but check this out nailed the bottom perfectly trading activity tends to be low at midnight UTC because Asia just woke up America is asleep Europe is asleep trading activity is low with low activity comes low prices because there's little trading volume the only trading volume that tends to be relevant at the time is the existing Traders potentially trading Bots trading against one another so if you're trading mem coins actively and those mem coins aren't yet dominated by the centralized exchanges dominated by all kinds of massive algorithms but the price action is actually dominated by the retail investor it makes sense to buy around midnight UTC so the price Peaks tend to around 8 hours before midnight UTC the price bottoms tend to be around midnight UTC again it's not perfect but the trading volume tends to move pretty perfectly in that direction and again very often when the day has just started the recurring Traders tend to be higher than the firsttime traders that even happens on day when over the time the firsttime Traders outpace right they all come later in the day and so it doesn't make sense to buy this bottom right technically we seem to have traded around this trading range for quite a while this seems to be a quite inviting support is this a potential low risk versus high return trade let's have a look at what the Wales and the large retail investors are doing so this is the daily trading volume by segment and we can see how the Wales tend to dominate the trading when prices are low so have a look at this massive trading volume by the Wales on the 23rd of May that was over here and now that 10 to come back again they seem to be accumulating again since the 13th not as much as they initially bought of course but still they tend to accumulate again they started on the 13th they buy more and more as we're falling down and that's a positive sign when we add large retail to this it's not as clear of a sign the cut off for all of those different cohorts is the following small retail is wallets below $1,000 medium retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100K and whales are more than 100K of holding of the token and I believe when the large money is getting involved when the large money is buying that's potentially good because the large wallets are large for a reason right they tended to make the right calls in the past and so I do believe that success is somewhat correlated with past performance right if you made the right calls in the past probably you are skilled somewhat probably know things that other people don't and so seeing those wallets getting slowly engaged again is good again they are slowly getting engaged it's not like they are buying massively they're starting to buy and so that's probably a good approach in this market the current momentum is obviously negative but the price is also very low and so it's very hard to pick the bottom perfectly right but beer coin seems to be a pretty big deal on the Solana chain as a whole and so I'd be very surprised if the coin suddenly completely disappears and nobody's going to trade it anymore check this out bcoin had most trading volume in the last 24 hours on the entire chain and ordered by liquidity it's still at number six it does have a bit of upside though now right it can easily 3x again from here and the 3x of course would put the price to similar Heights where we had been before so what do I personally do I am planning to buy some beer coin as well I say I'm planning to not I have bought I will buy I always announce this beforehand I never buy a coin before and then make a video to pump and dump on you I always buy after publishing a video and this time a few hours after publishing this video I'm also going to buy some beer coin I'm going to do this in a similar fashion as the Wales so I'm going to deil into this in case we see a further crash I might buy some more but I'm not going to bet the farm on this right the momentum is still negative a lot of people have been burned and the market has to calm down first I will continue to make updates on beer coin so if you're interested in that feel free to subscribe a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram then feel free to click the link down

token is on a nice rally again and it's one of those few tokens that have a real solid platform behind them now let's have a look at how much longer this really can last let's see who's buying and selling here let's have a look at toomics let's try to find out whether not makes sense to buy Arham now we are currently at $1.97 we are up 10% today 41% this week 94% this month and almost 500% this year now this is not the first video about Aram on this channel I published one 240 days ago and the video was an outperformer A lot of people are still interested in Arham we still see occasional YouTube search traffic now at the time the price was $138 it is higher now it did outperform Bitcoin it didn't outperform a lot of other altcoins though I tried to be early on this channel I publish videos on altcoins regularly also on Arham so fear free to subscribe now let's have a look at the onchain analytics we've got more than 25,000 holders on the ethereum chain and aam isn't just your random token with pi in the sky promises aam has a functioning very nice and useful platform and so let's have a look at the Aram token on the Aram platform what we see is that recently the open interest or The Leverage trading on Aram is shooting up in other words the price is going up but some of that might be short-term leverage now here is what I personally use Aram most for Aram is a nice platform to see how Wallets on chain are related to one another so I like to find out other influencer wallets I try to find out wallets of people that tend to move the markets and sometimes those wallets are transferring back and forth we in the end get a whole list of wallets of somebody that might move the market and that's always useful because we can also use those wallets for alerts but more on this later so for example have a look at this this is Alex Becker those are the known wallets by Arkham they of course way more wallets than what knows but still we can see that the wallets that Arham tracks the full balance was once at 4 million and the profit that Alex Becker made was almost 2 million and so this is what I mean with related wallets we can see that Alex Becker is using all kinds of centralized exchanges for example gate.io or qoin or binance but we can also see various other transfers and especially if they're frequent transfers to an unlabored wallet this can very often be either his own wallet or a very close asso now we've already seen this on the Arham Explorer we also see this over here on coin gecko there's currently quite a bit of hot air in the price when we look at the Perpetual Futures market and search for trading volume $200 million worth of Arham tokens moved hands on the binance Futures exchange and so also the spot Market is pretty much dominated by the centralized exchanges now on chain on ethereum we only see around 40 to 80 new wallets per day that hold Arham the majority of trading volume happens by returning users Aram was launched on chain so initially there was a ton of buyers and sellers thousands of them but that has now changed now it's hovering around 100 again because a lot of trading happens on the centralized exchanges now now here's something interesting when we look at the number of wallets over time both for retail and for the whales this tends to go up over time so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 500 Arham tokens at the current price that's a bit under $1,000 in the middle we go a 10x from that so that's a minimum holding of roughly $110,000 on the right we've got the Wales a minimum holding of $100,000 now this is steadily climbing up why do we then see how the price can drop from $4 all the way to $1 and when we look at those big whale wallets why do we see this suddenly jumping from 130 to 370 the answer to both questions is over here it's the toomics it's the unlocks of Aram unfortunately Aram is a highly ating token the supply is growing over time and if demand doesn't outgrow that Supply growth then the price Goes Down And So currently we are at 289 million Arham tokens and one year from now this will roughly double and then the question is will the number of holders also double in that time or will it even grow faster than that in the last year it definitely grew faster than just 2x let's see what the next year holds especially let's have a look at what those whales are doing and so that then explains why in market cap we are pretty close to the alltime high while the price is still 50% away from that it requires more and more money to flow into Arham for the price just to stay stable now don't get me wrong I really like the Arham platform I really like the functionality I use it almost every day the tokenomics of the Arham token unfortunately aren't that great it's very bad to hold the token during a bare Market it's acceptable to hold it as crypto expense so if enough new people jump on the token if everybody throws money at Arham then of course the price can rise it's very hard though to estimate which force will be stronger if it will be the demand growth or the supply growth again because Supply grows that fast now here's how I use Aram in premium we've got various tutorial videos and one of those videos is how to find other influencer wallets so besides the officially tracked wallets by Alex Becker for example we've got a lot of other wallets as well that you found through those related wallet feature there's also a wallet alert mechanism of Aram so you can send yourself alerts to Discord or to telegram via Aram whenever any of those influencers buy and sell now why is this useful it's useful because very often influencers buy tokens beforehand or they get tokens from the team before then advertising it afterwards in YouTube now once they advertise it of course a lot of new people come into the token pushing up the price now if we buy the token together with the influencer before the video is published we have potential gains now in premium there's a lot of other tutorials as well there's hundreds of videos the link is down below it's the Bitcoin stay.com and so we've got dedicated telegram chats just for wallet research just to find other wallets so that we can then plug this into our alerting tool and that we can then know that Stan crypto for example is currently buying Bobo or that the pcoin based AI team is buying buy I got a message from one of our premium members that bought the Bowie token upon one of those tracking signals and that's then what subsequently happened and so of course there are also dedicated Chats on individual altcoins if you want to learn about onchain analytics if you want to trade altcoins early if you want to get a market Edge then feel free to check it out if you learned something about Arham if you got some value out of this feel free to subscribe again I publish videosly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the

talked about beam even before it was launched when was still called Merit circle now how long can this really last we are currently at roughly 3.3 cents and in the last month alone the price went up by 85% now here's a very similar looking chart compare those two charts the prices are different bio 100x because this chart is Merit Circle Merit Circle made a Rebrand went to beam and migrated to a new token with a 1 to 100 ratio and we talked about Merit circle before beam was even launched on September 4th so that was over here since then the price more than 10x so if this is your first time to hear about beam or about Merit Circle maybe you should be following channels like this now let's talk about demand and Supply because demand and Supply is what determines the price and we all want to know where the price is going how is the supply developing over time how much Tok unlocks are there how is demand developing is this only small retail that's buying or is the Smart money are the whales buying as well let's have a look at all of this what we've got over here is the page of token. unlocks do app for merit Circle beam right now we've got 767 million tokens floating now this is Merit Circle simply multiply this by 100 to get the number of beam tokens because again there's a 1 to 100 conversion one year from now the supplyer will be at 929 million so yes there is a supply expansion it does decrease over time and especially given the current momentum around the project and given that there's a lot of money flowing into crypto I don't think the expansion is too bad of course the ideal would be to never see an expanding Supply but then you also don't have any money for development any money for marketing that's also not that great usually for an altcoin so the supply side of the equation seems to be okay let's have a look at the demand who is buying here let's look at onchain analytics so so that's the beauty of the blockchain we can look at who's buying and who's selling is the Smart money buying is a smart money selling who's driving the current price value and to answer that question I have built a tool you can plug in any ethereum token into that tool and we can look at the number of retail wallets versus whale Wallets on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 30,000 beam tokens so at the current price that's roughly $11,000 that's the regular retail in the middle we've got medium siiz retail that's now minimum holding of $110,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the token those are very long-term charts they start in October of 2023 so that's since the Rebrand but since the price is going up 85% in the last month alone let's look at the same charts in the last month only the number of retail wallets grew by roughly 17 to 18% the number of whale wallets grew by roughly 7.7% so so all wallet cohorts are buying small retail is buying the whales are buying the whales aren't buying as quickly though as regular retail but still there is no selling whatsoever everyone seems to be accumulating this is very very positive now what about the mega whales though the wallets that hold most of the tokens are they buying are they selling what happens to the smart contract wallets what happens to the centralized exchange wallets what we've got over here is the token distribution pie chart and we've got 27% of all of Supply in a smart contract wallet another 133% again in a smart contract wallet another 12% in another smart contract wallet this is all related to the team but then the first wallet that's not team related is a centralized exchange wallet that's binance 11% over here another wallet that doesn't change its balance and then number six is a buybit wallet here is smart contract wallet number one rather accumulating smart contract wallet number two also accumulating or staying steady smart contract wallet number three nothing happening here is the binance wallet here is the buy bit wallet so everybody is accumulating here small retailers buying the whales are increasing in Number the centralized exchangers are buying more and more the smart contracts also scoop up more and more of the token I don't see anything negative fundamentally around the demand now that's not to say that there is nothing at all that could be said negatively about beam have a look at the table behind me here are crypto currencies ordered by market cap in the gaming sector and I think it's a fast stretch to call internet computer a gaming cryptocurrency immutable X definitely is though beam is already the second largest gaming cryptocurrency and it takes less than a 3X from here to become number one so that would hint that maybe at least in terms of relative performance to other gaming cryptocurrencies the upside potential might be a bit limited of course I do believe that the US doar valuations of all kinds of altcoins are going up especially of crypto gaming but within gaming I'm not sure how much beam can still outperform despite all of that demand and despite the relatively low Supply increase there are very smart people that are also heavily betting on IMX and not yet betting on beam it's going to be an interesting altcoin season and of course I will continue to cover beam in the future as well on this channel I've made several videos already and so again if it's a first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow to get

now let's see if this week long rally is finally turning around and if you're going to see a dump or if long-term adoption actually continues let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people are not considering now here's the price action in the last few days we are down from the top of almost $1 to now 63 cents a loss of 33% this might sound like a lot but in the grand scheme of things this could be a start of something potentially much worse because that 33% decline is this little blip over here in this longer term chart we have seen SPX 6900 going down by 95% now it's interesting to see that today the number of buyers is way larger than the number of sellers but still the buying volume is not equaling the selling volume thus we are down by 7% so it seems like a case of the Wales and of the early buyers now taking profit now the onchain analytics are a bit more complex because there are three versions of the token there's one on ethereum this is where most capital is with 16,000 holders but there's also a version on the base chain with 14,000 holders and of course the casino on Solana is running as well there we've got 18,000 holders now this is not the first video of SPX 6900 on this channel I covered it actually very early so the first video was published 2 weeks ago at a time when the price was 11 cents and even after that correct we are up almost 6X now here's what's interesting about YouTube when you talk about a token that's not yet popular but might become popular in the future the views are actually not that great so as said I published several videos on SPX 6900 and the first video with the lowest price it tended to be initially an underperformer nobody was interested the last video though where the price was much higher was an outperformer and so that's unfortunately how the algorithm works right it spreads whatever is popular but whatever is popular tends to be also high in price so if you don't want to miss the next video when I talk about something early feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various meme coins regularly on this channel now let's dive into the current metrics of SPX 6900 and let's start with the ethereum chain on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 1,000 SPX 6900 tokens at the current price that's roughly $600 we go a 10x for the middle chart that's $6,000 for the right the minimum holding is $60,000 so there's $7,500 small r Wallets on ethereum there's only 800 such Wallets on base and there's 4,800 such Wallets on Solana so it looks like we can pretty much ignore the numbers on base price Discovery definitely doesn't happen here now let's compare the price development in the last month with the holder development in the last month because initially we had our very beautiful rally but then we're turning around since the 13th of October now here's the last month on ethereum with the number of holders so now we don't look at the all time time charts we only look at the last month and so the number of small retail holders continues to grow despite the price retracing medium-sized retail so all the wallets with at least $6,000 at current prices also continues to grow if we then go another order of magnitude up though so $60,000 this is where we see the turnaround now that turnaround did not happen on the 13th of October it already happened around the 7th 8th and 9th of October this is where accumulation some what stalled and then the selling started happening on the 10th 11th and 12ths and so have a look at this again right since the 10th of October the price action is getting a bit more choppy and so if the whales continue to sell we probably continue to see heightened volatility now there's one Central metrics that's especially important for meme coins and that's new investors are there actually new people coming into the token and this is potentially also accelerating because the more new people jump onto a project the higher the price can sustainably go now here's that data again we're looking at ethereum and we see the number of new users per day and this peaked on the 12th of October since then is coming down and we have to ignore the last data point here on the 17th of October because the day hasn't yet finished so again that's the data on Eve and here's the same data on Solana pretty much the same picture the peak is happening somewhere around the 9th maybe 12th of October on the left side is the user count on the right side is a transaction count the transaction count peaked on the 12th of October now we can also compare the firsttime traders to the recurring Traders and a clear flip has happened after the number of firsttime Traders peaked so now we see the existing Traders battling against one another not so many new Traders coming in and I believe that the whales know about things like this that's why they're exiting crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the people that have better data the people that are better informed they tend to make the money right they tend to beat the market and so I like to look at what the people are doing that have most money that tended to make the best calls in the past and they're clearly not accumulating as quickly as they used to so yes the number of buyers tends to grow now relative to the number of sellers this by the way is again on Solana and yes in the last weeks the price of course could rise with that heightened trading volume but still just the number of buyers exceeding the number of sellers does not necessarily help when the whales on average have more than 100 times more holding than the retail investor right we've seen this at the beginning of this video the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers but the buying volume does not exceed the selling volume so the sellers simply have more money and so on the left we've got the token balance by holder size small and medium retail is getting more of the overall token Supply or in other words the whales are selling the small guys are buying and that selling pressure is pretty significant so the whale Holdings went from 60 million worth of value all the way down to 42 million while the value for small retail barely changed because they continue to buy and so there's the hope of some people that there will be more centralized exchange listings but I'm not sure if that's going to happen if the whales continue to sell the token is listed on mexc but the trading volume isn't actually that large price Discovery really happens directly on chain on radium for Solana and on Unis swap for ethereum that's where all the trading volume is and so this YouTube channel has a premium Community as well and we talk about all kinds of all coins and of course that also includes SPX 6900 a shout out to guok and Tokyo tracks who are very active in onair analytics in the channels here's aosst of some onchain data on October 13th where shared that SPX is likely going to Peak and so our members have taken profit again the 13th of October was over here was the perfect timing and so feel free to learn onine analytics yourselves there's all kinds of different tutorials in premium there's a whole course just dedicated to finding other wallets but there also videos on micro indicators on portfolio management Etc hundreds of videos now to improve your crypto game of course you use those onchain Antics not only to time the market we also use it to monitor other successful Traders and so have a look at all of those SPX trades made by Kyle chesse in the early days we've got 12 of its wallets monitored always giving us an alert whenever he buys and sells and of course all the graphs all the statistics that you have seen in this video are part of a tool set of Premium as well well so there's a tool for the ethereum based blockchains there another tool for Solana and of course also a tutorial video on how to use all of this there's even videos on how to build tools like this yourself now to sum it all up I don't have a crystal about either where SPX is going the only thing I can say is that the whales are actively dumping they are selling their tokens and that does depress the price our members are taking profit and are looking for the next opportunity I believe that's the right thing to do if you got something out this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and of course looking forward to seeing you on premium as well

opportunity to buy the dip or is the rally over we're going to look at data that most people are not looking at this is the crash I'm talking about we are down more than 18% the first time we talked about Celestia on this channel though was when the price was at $3.82 now it's at $15 so if you want to be early next time maybe you should be following channels like this now What's Happening Here did the team stop working on the project the answer is of course no on GitHub we see a code update just 1 hour ago another one 2 hours ago 4 hours ago there's still more than enough programmer activity the social metrics also look solid the Twitter following for example grew by more than 10% since beginning of this year alone now Celestia was one of the best performers in this bull run and one mro factor isn't turning too bullish recently something is turning around I'm talking about the stable coin market cap have a look at this this is the stable coin market cap of D and tether and usdc and B USD all combined since beginning of 2022 there are two major events indicated here by these vertical lines the first one was the implosion of teral Luna of the US stable coin of the anchor protocol with teral Luna imploding the stablecoin market cap went down crypto as a whole started to shrink now this then turned around at the beginning of October of last year and I believe that beginning of October of last year was the starting point for a lot of altcoin Ries because what are stable coins actually been used for they're mainly used for altcoin speculation right you deposit your Fiat into a centralized exchange like binance binance then sends that Fiat over to tether and tether then prints the token for you to swap against your stable coin tether versus stable coin so the more money we see flowing into centralized exchanges the the more stable coins are being generated and the higher this chart goes and when it doesn't grow that much anymore probably altcoin speculation is going down and here's that potential problem we don't yet have real confirmation but look at this in the last 10 days this did not go up anymore this is a chart with relatively low volatility and so if people are taking profit if people aren't depositing Fiat into centralized exchanges anymore then of course the tokens that made most gains are also seeing most of the sell pressure now this chart here is super important if we don't see this suddenly spiking up again then the whole crypto Market might be turning around for a while I always like to look at relative valuations to other cryptocurrencies as well because normally why do we get into an altcoin it's to outperform bitcoin and ethereum right if we just want crypto exposure we can simply buy Bitcoin or ethereum but by buying an altcoin we take on more risk we want to get more return now it's more common to compare an altcoin valuation to bitcoin than it is to ethereum but I think that's actually a take I think it's better to look at alt coins relative to ethereum and here's why what we've got over here is a correlation Matrix one means perfect correlation zero means no correlation minus Z means negative correlation now look at those altcoins over here and check their correlation to bitcoin it tends to be positive but look at the altcoin correlation relative to ethereum it tends to be higher right the numbers here on the second column they tend to be higher than on the first column in other words there are more price commonalities more commonalities in the price between ethereum and the altcoins than between Bitcoin and the altcoins and again that makes sense because a lot of altcoin tokens are traded against ethereum so in order to distill now the idiosyncratic movements of the altcoin we want to look at this relative to e and not relative to bitcoin and what we've got over here is Tia divided by eve since October of last year since the stable coin market cap started to increase and yes the outperformance of Celestia was was nice more than 300% and yes just from a TA perspective this does look like a nice buying opportunity the potential upside versus ethereum is easily above 20% but in order for this to happen I think this number here the stablecoin market cap has to go up as well Celestia has to be fueled by the General market I've talked about Celestia several times on this channel and I've talked about the fundamentals as well I want to talk about one data point that's new and that's this page over here this is the open job positions for Celestia and Celestia is currently looking for a CFO a remote position CFO Chief Financial Officer I'm not sure what happened to the current CFO the rest of the management looks very intact the CEO of celesia has been with the company more than four years the CTO has been with Celestia also more than four years the chief research officer came 3 months later and the COO has been with Celestia for almost 3 years and had been a co-founder of Harmony I've already talked about this in prior videos but I want to keep mentioning this again there will be a huge unlock of Celestia tokens in October of this year that's when the early Beckers the early investors and the core team gets a lot of allocation will they sell directly on that day nobody knows probably not but still it's an important data point to keep in mind if it's the first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also free telegram link is

longterm, ENS Tokenomics,  #Ethereum Name Service #ENS #crypto","what is going on with ethereum name service with the ens token it's one of the top performers today and in the last week who's buying here who's selling here and why let's look beyond the price action let's have a look at onchain data to figure out what's actually going on now here's a list of top cryptocurrencies it's ordered by the performance in the last 7 days this is the top 100 and enss is at number one now what's happening over here some people think that it's the upcoming launch of a new layer 2 blockchain on top of ethereum so there's going to be yet another layer two on top of Eve there's so many already there's polygon there is base there's optimism there's arbitrum now there will be name chain at one point the founder of ens Nick Johnson also gave several interviews about the topic but can that really explain that today the price is up by 34% or that it's up by 91% this week or that it more than 4 xed in the last year I'm not sure if it's the news that are driving the prices otherwise crypto journalists would be the richest people on the planet what's really driving prices is what the Wales are doing now let's have a look on chain on the ethereum blockchain what those 66,000 holders roughly are currently doing because not all of those 66,000 holders are created equally some of them might just hold a few cents of the token others might hold hundreds of thousands of dollars of the token let's have a look at the performance in the last month what happened in the last month on the left side we see the number of new wallets per day on the right side we see the ratio of new versus returning wallets per day so normalized to 100% And we can see very nice growth actually we went from around 60 new wallets per day to now more than 200 and today it hasn't even finished right today has just started we're probably going to end up with around 400 new wallets just today the ratio of returning versus new users tends to be somewhat stable though we had tens of thousands of buyers of sellers upon launch and we do see how after the launch we sometimes see those spikes in attention currently we tend to spike again now here's something very interesting and I believe that's the reason why the price is currently going up and why the price still stays somewhat stable it's the whales that accumulate over time so what we see over here are the number of whale wallets versus the number of retail wallets over time in the middle is something in between so to be counted for the chart on the left one has to hold at least 30 ens tokens so at the current price that's around $1,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle it's 300 tokens so $10,000 minimum holding on the right side another 10x minimum holding so a $100,000 worth of the token the small wallets tended to sell off their airdrop over time the large whales tend to buy it up now I personally I do not like to look at us dollar charts because over time of course the US dollar expands in Supply so over time pretty much every asset goes up in price what I think is more important is opportunity cost right so are we going to to buy ethereum or are we going to buy ens the thing that's more risky should bring more return over time because the assets are correlated with one another right when ethereum goes up then ens goes up as well when it goes down then the other thing goes down as well so since there's so much correlation in a diversified portfolio it makes sense to buy either of those two assets right it doesn't make that much sense to own a lot of both and so here we've got the ens price divided by the ethereum price how much did ens outperform ethereum over time and this chart starts in November of 2021 we have seen a slight underperformance but there is quite a bit of volatility from bottom to top we see relies of more than 200% from top to bottom we see crashes of 75% now here's something very interesting that tends to be a correlation between the price and the trading volume of an asset so at the bottom we see the trading volume whenever trading volume spikes up the price also tends to spike up whenever trading volume tends to trigger down the price also has the possibility to rather bleed we see this especially for meme coins that are mainly driven by attention but we can also see it for tokens like ens now in a situation where the current momentum is negative and where we suddenly see a crash High trading volume can also mean a turnaround because at this point in time a lot of tokens move hands so the small retail investors might be causing the crash and then there's new investors buying at that dip right and they've got a different reference price they can Digest more risk and that's normally when selling pressure sub seeds so it's always interesting to look at those spikes in trading volume currently we are rather High both on the trading volume and on the price that's not necessarily that great normally it's better to buy when nobody is looking when trading volume is very low when not a lot of new people enter the token now here's the thing I believe that most upside potential is in the small market cap tokens and it's especially in the meme coins have a look at this in the last seven days what performed the best it's all meme coins and it's hundreds of percent potentially we talked about chill guy earlier on this channel we talked about bully early on this channel we also talked about the tits token early on this channel so feel free to follow here because here's the problem once a token Rises to a certain market cap it takes a lot of capital again to double and triple the token and especially for meme coins that do have a lot of risk that can easily go down by 50 60% you do still want to see the up side potential and so when the market cap is already pretty high in the billions of dollars then there is not that much upside potential but there's still the downside potential so the risk ver beward isn't that great have a look at this this is the largest meme coins in the last week pretty much everything went down only Dogecoin went slightly up so once a mem coin has risen to a certain level it's time to be cautious it might make sense to go into the tokens that are not in the billions but only in the tens of millions maybe hundreds of Millions but the question is always how can we pick the right small meme coin right there are so many small mem coins how do we not get burned and I believe the answer to this is wallet tracking so the blockchain is 100% transparent and once we've got a wallet of a certain influencer of somebody that moves markets of somebody that is a top Trader of somebody that did do the right things in the past once we have those wallets we've got a very nice mechanism to filter what to buy and what to sell have a look at this so this is Martini guy and he bought the moon token when it was still at 466 so that was even before the listing on radium so that was directly on the pump. fun ecosystem platform when he bought his position went up by more than 4,000% of course it subsequently collapsed but that's the idea of trading right you don't just want to buy and hold meme coins mem coins are a rotation game you want to be in as long as the momentum is positive and you want to exit very quickly once that turns around I have a look at this year another alert by the martini guy he bought the fatest token again directly on pump fun and again a very similar development so the purchase happened directly on the platform subsequently the price went up by 1, 680% and then came crashing back down now what's important with buying tokens that early with tracking other influencers is that first of all we have to take profit but secondly also we have to be somewhat Diversified we can't bet half of our portfolio on a single bet this is very risk on so here again the martini guy he bought chippy and that was at 2022 here are his purchases now it's at 20 one6 so there are trades that don't necessarily always work out it is a game of Risk versus reward you want to buy when the upside is still there you don't want to buy the meme coins that are in the billions of dollars but when going risk on like this it's more important than with any other strategy not to lose everything right it's important to make small bets every now and then and then take profit when those make multiple X returns and so that's why I made several tutorial videos on the topic on risk mitigation on portfolio diversification of course also on onchain tracking Etc now I've talked about him now often enough so here is that guy this is Martini guy he's got 150,000 subscribers and we track 12 of his wallets we did this through onchain analytics we found out some of his wallets but check this out this is Alex Becka's Channel we also track his wallets he's got 1.5 million subscribers now when he talks about a token it puts that much attention on the token that of course the price has to rise we've got also 12 of his wallets we're also tracking Crypt Benta with 1.1 million subscribers we've got 33 of their wallets and so I really believe this is the way to get an edge in crypto it's not just buying random tokens that are funny that are in some kind of list of trending tokens I think it's much more important to follow the Insiders it's to follow the early money it's to follow the people that have more attention that can push prices higher I like this strategy of wallet tracking that much that I made a dedicated tutorial course on just that so it's eight videos in total it's how to find influencer wallets it's how to track them it's also how to interpret the signals that we get from the tracking once we have a signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to discuss our onchain analytics we have to compare what kind of conclusions we come to that's why we've got our dedicated chat on the individual alt coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for you and so does it still make sense to buy ens possibly because all of crypto is currently expanding and ethereum is very very depressed right now if ethereum can rebound then very likely ens will come with it what's very important though I believe is to watch very closely how much this layer two will get adoption because if it does get widespread adoption which probably the market is currently pricing in then everything is fine if it doesn't get that adoption though then the price might as well deflate again it looks like retail is selling while the whales are buying I personally prefer to follow the Wales right the whales tend to make the better calls they've got that much money for a reason they probably traded pretty smart in the past and it's more likely that those kinds of Traders are going to make the right calls in the future as well if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly a like would be very much appre appr as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

Nero on ethereum is struggling it's down this week let's have a look whether or not it makes sense to buy this dip or if you should rather stay away let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people AR considering let's see who's buying and selling here so we're talking about the first Nero on ethereum token the largest market caps of the neuros so it's at 0.16 cents today and it starts with the contract symbols 8 one Tob a lot of meme categories did pretty well last week so the AI memes went up by 38% the pump. fun ecosystem went up by 25% but again our neuro token went down 10% and that's after its phenomenal rally of almost 4,000% since listing on coin market cap is this R now finally over now I'm covering nuro regularly on this channel and usually those videos tend to outperform quite a lot indicating that there is retail interest so have a look at this video published a bit over 2 weeks ago the Blue Line indicates the performance of that video the gray area shows a typical video and among the trending tokens on ethereum Nero still holds one of the top spots it's got a liquidity of 12 million on chain now when it's one of the most liquid tokens on chain when it's got a lot of capital the question really is how much more upside is there we can have a look at Market size comparisons so the largest of the neuro tokens has a market cap of almost 700 million Bonk has roughly twice that dog with hat has a bit more than three times that but then the air gets thin right then we've got Dogecoin and Chino and pepe more than a 3X is rather unlikely for Nero and that might explain why the excitement around the token could be waning somewhat now as said I publish videos on Nero regularly here and the first video was published 1 month ago at the time the price was at 30 R 8 now even after the correction we are still at Double that price so I try to be early on this channel if you don't want to miss any video feel free to subscribe it's not just videos on Nero it's videos on various alt coins now as usual let's have a look at the onchain metrics because this is where you can get real insight we can have a look at who's buying who's selling now on chain we've got roughly 177,000 holders so that's on the ethereum Chain but not all wallets are created equally right some of those holders might just have a few cents worth of the token and so let's have a look at the holder development say in the last month for the last month the price in total still went up by more than 40% so yes we do face a price depression right now but for the last entire month in total we are still up now here are the onchain metrics that I believe matter and all of those metrics look at just the last month at the top left we've got the number of small holders so that's hold us that have $11,000 worth of nuro at the current price this number tends to decline at the beginning of the month it was at 3,800 now it's at 3,400 a drop of more than 10% now for the medium holders that's wallets that have at least $110,000 worth of the token that went from 1,420 wallets to ,200 wallets so again a drop of more than 10% and then on the right we've got the Wales that's the wallet that have more than $100,000 worth of the token that went from 426 to 366 so a drop of maybe 15% or so almost 20% the number of wallets declined across the board no one's accumulating while the price net during the same time frame went up what's exactly going on here this is a bit counterintuitive right it feels like there might be one whale or a few whales that buy a lot of the token and that push up the price despite all of that mass selling now let's have a look at the two other charts here on the left side we see the number of new users versus return earning users on any given day every single day we see more existing traders that get in and out of the token than new users and when we just look at the overall trend we tend to be going down right there seems to be less and less new users pretty much since the 7th of October of this year now the 7th of October is over here since then the price actually increased first and we are at very comparable price levels right now and so we do see how the interest in Nero is fading probably because the upside isn't really there anymore the market cap is pretty large at the same time the price did not yet correct according to how many people have sold and it seems like it's the very very large wallets that are buying here when we look at those largest wallets we actually do see how the balance is increasing over time have a look at this almost 60% of the entire nuro on E Supply is held by a binance wallet now here's that Wallet balance development over time it continues to go up it's binance that's buying here now not all of the tokens that are held by binance are held in the name of users right it's not just custody there's also balances that get held simply for Market making I think that is what's going on here because let's have a look at the trading volume on binance and especially at the Perpetual Futures Market at the market for the bets on the price have a look at the following this is the different exchanges ordered by trading volume and interestingly enough number one is gate IO however when we look at the Perpetual Futures Market we see that binance has traded 1.3 billion worth of the token in the last 24 hours alone now how does this work imagine the following imagine you offer bets on a game right Perpetual Futures bets derivatives you offer bets on a game you make money with those bets and at the same time you also have an impact on the outcome of the game so you are paying the referee this is what's going on I I believe here with nuro on Eve binance holds most of the supply binance can dictate where the price is going at the same time they offer all of those derivative contracts in other words if a lot of people bet on Rising prices then they might be crashing the price and vice versa they will liquidate their customers of course because they want to maximize profits I believe it's too late to get into Nero I don't think there is organic growth in the token there's simply manipulation by binance and I don't dare to predict where binance will manipulate the price right they can move it up and down and in circles they can create a lot of volatility and it's very hard to predict in what direction that volatility will move crypto is all about timing it's all about being early and Nero is not early anymore right we are in the hundreds of millions of market cap but there is a way to be early there is a way to buy over here have a look at this this is our wallet tracking in premium and we found out how various influencers for example Kyle chesse bought a lot of new on the 30th of July already now the 30th of July was over here let's change this from a linear scale to a logarithmic scale here's the 30th of July since then the price went up by 56,000 per. and so that's how influencers and top Traders make money they follow other wallets and they're obviously also well connected so here's KY chesse he's got 133,000 subscribers but it's not just Kyle chesse that bought right we also have Unis dong over here but let's go go back to KY Chessie we've got 12 of his wallets we are tracking in total more than 400 wallets and of course not every signal is profitable like this but that's why we also have the chats right we've got dedicated chats in premium discussing various alt coins when to buy and when to sell in premium there's also a dedicated tutorial course so there are eight videos just on how to find other wallets and how to track them and how to then afterwards interpret those signals so that's over here fear free to check it out fear free to binch watch that but it's not just wallet tracking we've got also portfolio management we've got micro indicators Etc it's more than 100 videos right now in premium all tutorials so feel free to check it out there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first seven days and I'll refund you 100% I'm currently not bullish on Nero I think it's better to rather stay away there's too much manipulation going on by binance binance is not going to crash the price by 90% but I also don't think that the price will suddenly 3 or 4X from here if it's a first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in

Brett Price, Brett Price Prediction, Brett longterm, Brett Tokenomics,  #brett #memecoin #crypto","the Brett mem coin on the base blockchain had a quite nice week it ran up more than 25% while Bitcoin didn't go anywhere now let's have a look at how much longer this really can last let's see who's buying here let's see who's selling here let's look at onchain metrics most people are not considering so here we are we're currently at 11 cents a gain of 26.5% in the week and here's Bitcoin during the same time period now on chain Brett has almost 700,000 holders but not all of those holders are created equally just the minority of those holders has $11,000 just in the token now this is not the first video on Brett on this channel I publish videos on various meme coins regularly here and on average those videos tend to perform pretty well so the average video is here in Gray and in blue we see the performance of one of those bread videos published roughly 4 months ago here's another bread video also an outperformer and here's another one published roughly half a year ago also outperformed so appears as if there is a lot of attention on Brad and once we look at the onchain metric we actually see quite constant accumulation by retail now the onchain metrics won't tell us the whole story but they're at least a part of it because there is quite a bit of trading also happening in centralized exchanges which are black boxes we don't really know what's going on over here but there's trading on Unis swap there's trading on Aerodrome and that makes In Sum roughly 20% of the trading volume and so let's have a look at those 700,000 holders on the left side we see the number of holders that have 10,000 Brad tokens it's currently 35,000 wallets it's roughly $1,140 so roughly 95% of holders have less than $11,000 in the token now let's look at the holders that have even more let's go at 10x in minimum holding or $10,000 worth of the token now we are only looking at 6,666 wallets so by going another 10x in minimum holding we are reducing the amount of wallets by around 80% if you go another 10x so now we're looking at $100,000 worth of the token then we're reducing the number of wallets by another 80 to 90% now here's what's interesting right we see very constant accumulation by small retail we also see accumulation by medium-sized retail the very large whales did not necessarily grow that much they still go up in number but not as quickly so whatever long-term price appreciation we see is mainly driven by small retail now let's have a look at the last month where the price went up by roughly 40% and we see how that appreciation in price did not necessarily happen very smoothly let's go from the alltime charts to the charts that only have the last month again retail accumulates very consistently mediumsized retail doesn't necessarily so here we have seen selling in the last 2 weeks which kind of coincides also with the price going down by roughly 20% what we now see with the final leg up is that both small retail but also the Wales are accumulating again so this recent pump here is also driven by the Wales it's not just retail now how much more upside potential is there let's have a look at relative variations to other meme coins but before that feel free to subscribe I publish videos on Brett regularly I publish videos on other meme coins also regularly on this channel now let's make the comparison Brett has a market cap of roughly 1.1 billion if it was to 2x from here it would become part of the top five meme coins only do with Pepe Shinu and Dogecoin would be larger a 10x from here would flip everything but Dogecoin so would put it in the second largest of the meme coins and a 20x is pretty much unrealistic unless the market as a whole is going up just for outperformance it's unlikely that we're going to see $2 per Brad because that would flip the OG which is Dogecoin now here's something very fascinating it seems like in the early days of Brad there was some kind of manipulation by some holders happening because have a look at the number of buyers and sellers per day usually the ratio is somewhat balanced but we've got these spikes over here what happened here and let's also check out this over here the 3rd of July now what's interesting here we don't see that the trading volume on those those days was particularly high so apparently there were a lot of buyers more than 100,000 per day but the bread tokens that moved on those days didn't really increase and that's a strong sign for manipulation it seems like somebody wrote a script to buy and sell the token very often with a lot of different wallets with very small amounts to inflate the transaction numbers to then get listed on dexc screen.com on Dex tools on all of those screener sites because when you're trending token on those pages of course this also generates more attention potentially more buying but see what happened afterwards afterwards the price tended to go down so the day of the manipulation was the top and subsequently we saw a drop of more than 55% over here on the 3rd of July we also saw subsequently selling pressure usually it's good to see on a given day more buyers than sellers but when it shoots up that much and it becomes unrealistic and when actually not more tokens move hands then it's rather a sign to be called es and so I want to share this over here it seems like currently something very similar happens for the gme token so the gme token on Solana has seen 146,000 wallets active in the last 24 hours this is extremely inflated especially given that the trading volume was only 6.1 million so it seems like something very similar is happening it seems like gme is going to see a very nice dump now something similar to what happened in the early days of the bread manipulation so how can you spot this your s whenever you're considering to buy a token have a look at the number of transactions have a look at the number of makers have a look at the trading volume and let's say you're looking at the top trending tokens in the last 24 hours and you're ordering by the number of makers and you see that the trading volume is actually not that high then this is reason to be cautious have a look at this this is another pump and dump the PO token lost 50% or over here retardo solami index lost 60 6% GameStop is about to lose probably this match token isn't too great either so what you want to see is something more realistic now is this here more realistic 25 million 400,000 wallets it's also not realistic because here the liquidity pool is only 150k so there's barely any liquidity here so this also makes no sense let's have a look at the largest tokens let's order them by liquidity now we seem to have mainly more legitimate tokens MIT gigachad frog and we can see the number of wallets that are actually involved in a regular day 2,000 3,000 maybe 4,000 but definitely not 146,000 as we can see now on GameStop so I hope you're learning something out of those videos that goes beyond just buying or selling bread if you're researching your favorite crypto token make sure that the numbers all align and that nobody is manipulating to then create attention to then afterwards dump the price now we learned about Brett very very early there's the premium membership and we are tracking various influencer wallets and we have seen the first transactions happening in the middle of March when it wasn't even listed yet on coin market cap and we can see how the Dogecoin millionaire how crypto lifter how handsome Finance got involved in Brett and again that was when the price was over here since then we went up by 200% and to the top even by 400% so here's the Dogecoin millionaire has 15,000 subscribers here's handsome Finance 34,000 subscribers and here's Crypt lifter said 72,000 subscribers overall we're tracking more than 419 wallets here are the wallets of Kyle chesse here are the wallets of poo. Sol and we then discuss those signals in our altcoin chat groups to be early to then buy potentially with the influencer before they then afterwards promote this on their channels so again link is down below the Bitcoin trade.com if you're not that deep into memec coin trading though if you simply just want to discuss about Bitcoin there's also a free telegram that link is down below as well looking very much forward to seeing you there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrJCoWECW0,"['Bitcoin', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'Pepe', 'JUST', 'Gigachad']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFrJCoWECW0/hqdefault.jpg,2024-10-14T11:27:46Z

going to look at onchain data we're going to look at who's buying who's selling here because unfortunately in the last few weeks water didn't do too well is this potentially an opportunity to buy low and sell High because obviously we are no low it's not necessarily always right to just write the current momentum sometimes it might make sense to be contrarian let's have a look so the price of water is currently 364 we are down 72% since listing on coin market cap and that was roughly 3 weeks ago and despite this very bad price action water is still one of the largest meme coins on Solana so have a look at this this is Dex screener this is the Solana chain and we are ordering all coins all tokens on the Chain by liquidity so how much money is actually in the liquidity pool of a token and the water token even after that drop is still the fourth largest token and have a look at the performance in the last 24 hours it's still one of the worst performers crypto isn't doing too bad recently but water is and so that's then the long-term chart let's take away the initial dump just look at the recent price action we are relatively low in that negative Trend but if you just look at the pace of this downwards Trend it's almost 50% in the span of 2 weeks so on the chart it looks relatively harmless but actually this is quite Steep and it's not because there is not enough buyers right just have a look at this the number of buyers actually exceeded the number of sellers in the last 24 hours still we are down 20% that's simply because the sellers tend to be selling more than the buyers despite the price going down usually we see the exact opposite when the price is rising in a mem coin then the sellers tend to be selling more in terms of US dollars because they take profit right they maybe turned $1,000 into $3,000 and then when they exit of course there's more sell pressure when the price is going down usually it needs more sellers than buyers for the price to continue to go down but right now we actually see more buyers but the sellers still sell more the amount per transaction when there's a sale tends to be higher than when there's a buy my impression is that the team and the early adopters they continue to sell hard because even on days where there are more new investors versus recurring investors we still see the price going down check out this graph we want to see more firsttime Traders than recurring Traders because new firsttime Traders means that the investor base is growing and so there was a lot of adoption on the first two days and then on the 8th of July we saw another influx of first-time Traders the 8th of July is over here where we initially got our dump and then a subsequent pump but still overall the negative momentum prevailed this is very atypical usually we see the price reverting getting bullish whenever there's a lot of new people coming in because that often means that there's some kind of marketing going on some kind of positive news and that normally bleeds into several days and that normally leads to positive price action not so for water we saw a pump and a dump and all of those new firsttime Traders roughly 10,000 new wallets in a single day did not help the price and so all of this looks very bearish there is one interesting metric though that says the opposite check this out this is the number of retail investors versus whale investors so we are counting here the wallets with different holding thresholds on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 1.5 million tokens that's currently $1,000 worth of the token so that's retail that went down since launch in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now at 10x so that's minimum $10,000 worth of the token on the right we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $100,000 worth of the token usually we do not see this Dynamic usually we see accumulation by retail and dumping by the Wales not this time the smart money is accumulating the heavy weights are buying because this is how I see crypto right crypto is both a game of skill and of luck and the people that play the game for long enough they accumulate more and more Capital so the whales tend to make the better calls than just your average retail Joe and so when very deep pockets are buying this is a potentially good signal there are 45 wallets out there that have at least $100,000 worth of the token it might make sense to Simply get into s so scan and have a look at what those kinds of wallets are one explanation could be accumulation by centralized exchanges right gate iio has 20% of trading volume and maybe they want to manipulate the token at some point is not easy to manipulate the token because again the liquidity pool on chain is relatively large but in case you're considering to short this token because of the negative momentum think again right there is potentially some danger there's a lot of volatility here as well if you're betting on falling prices at the wrong time you might wake up to a price pump of almost 300% I personally like shorting alt coins in this market I do not like to short water because again smart money is buying but the problem is that currently crypto as a whole is not expanding anymore the stable coin market cap is simply going sideways since the end of April of this year so it's 100% a player versus player game and especially inflationary tokens have a very hard time in this market for example have a look at this token it expands in Supply continuously and thus the relative performance to bitcoin and ethereum looks like this this is what I personally currently bet on I bet on falling prices of this asset I'm sharing what that asset is in premium premium so feel free to check it out it's the bitcoin.com there's also a dedicated tutorial video on how to set this all up if your crypto portfolio is at least $5,000 you should be making your money back just by depositing parts of that portfolio into the short so you're betting on this graph to simply just continue what it always did and again there's a justifiable reason for that it's the token inflation this is I believe where currently the alpha is it's very hard to make money with mem coin trading when there's no new players entering the space and when the Insiders are dumping on your joiners it's not so hard though to bet on falling prices again because most altcoins underperform Bitcoin and ethereum most of the time most returns are concentrated in just a few assets and if you avoid those assets then Alpha then outperformance is almost guaranteed I will continue to make updates on various meme coins so feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciated

Curve DAO Token (CRV) Crypto Price Prediction 2024,"Curve (CRV) is an Ethereum token that powers Curve.fi, a decentralized exchange and automated market maker protocol. The protocol is designed to make it easy to swap between ERC-20 tokens, such as stablecoins (like USDC and DAI) and Ethereum-based Bitcoin tokens (like WBTC and renBTC). In order to minimize impermanent loss, most of the protocol‚Äôs liquidity pools are made up of similar assets, although in June 2021, it introduced a USDT-WBTC-ETH ‚Äútricrypto‚Äù pool. The CRV token can be locked for various periods of time (up to 4 years) in order to vote on governance and claim protocol fees as a reward.",Transcript not available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyNsMobKTIk,[],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FyNsMobKTIk/hqdefault.jpg,2024-12-03T12:52:39Z

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #lievepper #lpt #crypto","one week ago we had a massive rally in the lpt token in life Pier the price shot up it then corrected somewhat now it's stabilizing is this potentially an opportunity let's have a look at the data that most people aren't looking at let's look at the data on chain now here's the rally I'm referring to with the subsequent correction we are currently at roughly $15 and two months ago I already made a video on live Pier at that time we were a bit over $9 nobody was interested in the video whatsoever it massively underperformed the gray area here is a typical video but then with the rally it caught up somewhat and this is then when people subscribed so maybe if you want to be early next time consider following channels like this I publish videos regularly now let's zoom out a little bit let's have a look at live Pier over the long term and let's compare the live Pier price the lpt token price with ethereum because that's in the end what we're all aiming for right we're looking for outperformance versus ethereum or versus Bitcoin otherwise we could simply just go low risk right why do we take on the high risk of an altcoin it's to get more return more risk has to be compensated with more return otherwise it's a bad investment let's have a look at this this here is the long-term lpt chart the long-term life perer chart divided by the ethereum price so the relative performance and we can see that since June of 2021 to today life Pier despite the recent rally underperformed ethereum by 55 .8% roughly now where does this underperformance come from very often for most altcoins it's token inflation it's not necessarily that the product is bad it's not necessarily that we don't get adoped it's simply that too much Supply gets issued and I believe it's the same here for Life peer have a look at the chart behind me this is misari IO it shows the number of circulating life peer tokens over time we started off with 11 million in December of 2018 now we are at 30 million if your 3x the supply that is no surprise that the price underperforms by 55% it probably should even underperform more when you look onchain you see a slightly different chart I believe that the tracking here is not very clean right we get these data glitches but on chain this looks way cleaner the numbers are similar we are starting at 10 million this time in May of 2018 and now we are at 24.8 million this is only the tokens on the ethereum chain in the last year alone the supply increased ined by 133% now what's causing this price ready who actually bought here was this small retail or was this the Wales or was this potentially manipulation by the centralized exchanges let's dive a bit deeper let's have a look at retail investors versus whale investors I look at these kind of charts regularly on this channel on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 100 live peer tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,500 in the middle we've got the medium-sized retail this is now $15,000 on the right we've got the Wales this is $150,000 so a 10x with each chart those are very long-term charts they all go up into the right let's have a look at the exact same charts but only for the last month no accumulation by any wallet cohort in other words this price value here did not happen on chain all of the demand came from the centralized exchanges now did it come from the centralized exchanges themselves as in for Market making or did it come from the customers of those centralized exchanges but I do have a hunch that this might be manipulation because otherwise we would see some kind of Demand on chain right we wouldn't see Zero and so let's have a look at the token ownership let's see who's holding lpt right now there is an escrow account by the team let's forget about that let's look at the rest we've got the largest holder as in binance 8% of all of Supply is on binance then we've got okx with 2.5% another binance address with 2.1% here is the binance wallet the balance is going up and they bought quite a lot already in November of last year here's the okx wallet also going up 600,000 tokens and here's the other binance wallet going up as well and so this is all supported with the trading data as well a lot of trading volume happens on binance and in the last 24 hours alone there was more than 200 million worth of Perpetual Futures exchanging hands on binance that's half of the entire market cap of Life pier and again this happened while binance only holds 10% of the supply I personally pass and I do not buy but please make your own decision here there are many cryptocurrencies out there and I prefer simply more visibility live peer could go up I personally though I have a hard time estimating the risk if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I probably you this regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the

particular emphasis on Sheba Inu and Dogecoin the two largest mean cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization a value Doge army sets the tone for future mean coins in its Dogecoin recap Robin Hood reminded the community that the original mean coin was created in 2013 as a parody of Bitcoin inspired by the popular doge meme Doge began to exist via the Litecoin Fork the Tweet stated and it had a mission to make cryptocurrency more approachable and fun after that despite the humorous idea on which it was based Dogecoin gained traction and eventually became WI used for tipping and charitable donations Robin Hood reminded readers that it was even used for funding the Jamaican bobsled team for the 2014 Winter Olympics the Tweet concluded that eventually the biggest achievement of Dogecoin was that it manages to set the tone for future mean coins over time Resurgence of mean coins meta thanks to sheep another tweet in that thread was dedicated to the Sheba a new meme inspired coin which was created in 201 20 Robin Hood's post said that she was designed to be even more community-driven token than Doge and released without any direct leadership after the launch within a few years she expanded onto platforms like Sheba Swap deex and became listed on various cryptocurrency exchanges including such monsters as binance the emergence of Sheba in new caused the Resurgence of the mcoin meta Robin Hood said ultimately Sheed marked a new precedent for mean coins the post stated 1.45 billion Doge transferred to Robin Hood popular blockchain sleuth whale alert has spotted several consecutive Mammoth siiz transfers that move almost $250 Million worth of do chin to Robin Hood they were five transactions each carrying 290 million Doge to the investment sltrading platform they were all sent within a single hour however due to the quickly changing exchange rate the fiate equivalent slly changed but overall each Doge transfer moves slightly more than $49 million making

helps support the channel but keep watching to find out the latest Sheba Inu updates and what the future could hold for the Sheba Inu coin she Burns spikes 24271 as Sheba and New Leads Deb discuss she's substantial growth the Sheba Inu Community recently observed a notable rise in its burn rate it surged 24271 within a single day this increase reported by the tracking platform shiber comes as the cryptocurrency's lead developer Shoshi kusama issued a statement about she's substantial growth since its all-time low four years ago shurn shared data showing that the assets daily burn rate surged 24271 within 24 hours destroying 5 b674 m617 337 sheep tokens earlier in the week there was another optic in sheep burn activity with a reported 305% increase that eliminated 39 m593 693 aeve tokens however the most substantial burn rate increased this week was recorded over the weekend reaching a high of 65529 per. despite this remarkable rate the amount burned was relatively small with only 2,6 15295 sheep removed from circulation Shoshi kusama highlights long-term growth alongside the recent activity Shoshi kusama addressed the token's long-term growth in a recent state on social media in response to a post highlighting Bitcoin status as the top performing asset of the past decade Hama pointed out the assets exceptional growth trajectory since hitting its lowest price on September 1 2020 according to cama the token has surged by an extraordinary 33 m774 726 per since that date hus sama's post also compared shiv's growth to other major cryptocurrencies Dogecoin another popular mean-based cryptocurrency Rose by 20258 3% over the same period while salana increased by 35715 and binance coin experienced an increase of 1,521 482 kusama remarked that despite the assets impressive gains the development team remains committed to further progress and aims to strengthen the ecosystem's reputation within the broader crypto Community price and market trends although the token has achieved extraordinary growth over the long term its recent price movement has been more volatile the token's price decreased by nearly 0.64% in the past 24 hours following a 5.05% surge earlier in the week this recent activity shows the continued interest and the tokens susceptibility to short-term fluctuations in line of these developments Hama emphasized the need for ongoing work to solidify the ecosystems value and credibility while recent burn rates demonstrate efforts to curb Supply and potentially support price stability market dynamics and investor sentiment remain critical factors in the tokens future now it's time for the main story of today's video data shows when she will reach 0.002 leading on chain metrics and price prediction firm coin codc has painted a bullish picture for the dog themed mean coin according to the price forecast sheep could hit 0.00 to not in the short term but in the long run investors who hold on for the long term and can wait for 25 years might see the token reach 0.002 the data analytical firm has projected that Sheba in new could reach 0.02 in 20149 that's another 25 years from today and only investors with diamond hands can wait that long the following 2 and a half decades could make she delete two zeros and hit a new all-time high Sheba in new would need to gain 53,723 per to reach 1 cent according to our prediction algorithm the price of sheep will not reach 1 cent the highest expected price our algorithm estimates is 0.002 by 249 read the forecast the estimate indicates that she would need many more years or even decades to consider hitting the one C shba Inu has set a new record for the first time in 2 months which is good news especially considering the state of the market however how exactly this new Improvement would affect Sheba enu in the following weeks and months is yet to be seen could this be a precursor for massive gains keep watching this video and you might be able to come come to your own conclusion hey there Sheba Army and Sheba Inu newbie and thank you for joining in for today's video if you've not yet subscribed to this Channel or you don't have your notifications turned on consider doing that because I give regular updates on Sheba Inu and the general crypto Market I'm sure you want to be kept in the loop so go subscribe and hit the notification Bell right now done now let's get on with the video before we get to the Crux of the video let's go through some quick updates first off analysts have given what they believe to be the best tip for sailing through this crypto winter and the tip was directed at cheap holders for those who don't know what a crypto winter is it's this period that we're in right now where the market is bearish the tip which might not seem like much to some is patience or in crypto language hling analysts seem to believe that hodling instead of selling off in a panic is the better action to take even and probably especially considering current circumstances they seem to believe that those that are looking to make a quick Buck are unlikely to get it from Sheba Inu but those that are in it for the long haul might benefit from the waight according to M crypto swing Traders and intraday Traders will have massive opportunities even though ship continues its range-bound movements in the coming weeks a proper trading system with strong psychology can ensure success provided the top losses are respected and the Target price isn't taken for granted that said it's important that you do your due diligence before making any sort of decision with your portfolio to hold or sell off should always be your decision after doing your own research nonetheless probably one indicator that holding ship might be a good idea even considering the crypto Market is the fact that there have been lots of ship Burns in recent times according to you today ship burn tracker has reported that over the past 24 hours an astounding half a billion Sheba Inu coins have been burned and moved out of the circulating Supply a total of 8,8 25,8 123 Sheba tokens were destroyed within the last 24 hours a result that took merely 15 transactions from the ship Community it is important to note though that trading activities have been noticed among ethereum whales who have shib in their portfolio that is while these whales have been purchasing the token in significant amounts it looks like they've also been selling speaking of purchasing blue hail 73 is reported to have purchased up to 147 billion ship just a couple of days after purchasing about 143 billion shib but on the other hand whale holding Holdings of shib have dropped to below 11% indicating that these whales have been selling off some of their Holdings the bottom line is that there are indicators that the Sheba Inu Market could swing either way more bearishness or array of bullishness whichever it is it would benefit you to do your research before committing to any course of action now to the main news just yesterday Sheba Inu trading volume hit and surpassed the 70% Mark for the first time in two months and the bulk of the trading activity was ship investors adding more ship tokens to their portfolio according to Cohen Kora 77% of shib investors on coinbase have put the token on buy width only 23% keeping it on sale this could be a sign of good things to come don't you think a little more than 2third of the market is interested in not just holding but actually buying the token this could mean that a price pump could be a possibility but we'll have to wait and see now to the general crypto Market Financial Market experts are starting to promise an interesting concept that they believe could move the crypto Market forward the concept is B metalism and the idea behind this concept is to have similar assets with each of them offering different values apparently this would help to offset the price inflation rate of either of the assets for instance with current crypto something similar that offers a different value could be privacy coins crypto is generally Anonymous but transactions can be traced back to their wallets of origin which definitely has its uses however privacy coins would make it practically impossible to trace the origin of transactions offering something that crypto does not now because both crypto and privacy coins offer something that the other cannot and also have gaps that the other fills they would each prop each other up which should help the crypto Market the whole thing is still kind of new but that's the basic idea so is b metalism a concept that can work for crypto please tell us what you think in the comment section with that we come to the end of this video if you enjoyed the video then please like the video and don't forget to leave a comment in the comment section this really helps me with the YouTube algorithm also please share this video to as many people as possible let's get this news out there if you are a true Sheba Inu fan then you must check out this video",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9c-9SNU8I,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Dogecoin',

rally historically if we zoom out this might look pretty bad however once we look behind the curtain on chain there's actually some interesting statistics most people aren't considering so this is the r I'm referring to we're currently at 0.7 CS the price is up 82% this week and I've published videos on the mute token a long time back 120 days ago over here another video 102 days ago and at the time the price was only at 0.4 I publish videos on Meme coins regularly and I try to be early and so if this is your first time researching the M token maybe consider following channels like this right again I try to publish videos when most people aren't yet considering a token now here's the potential problem with the price chart this is all the history we've got on coin market cap in we are very close to all-time highs in the price and this because historically we dumped afterwards could be a potential warning but the rally that we're seeing recently is somewhat different let me show you some interesting onchain data here's the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on any given day for the M token and on the 20th we've seen a massive influx of firsttime Traders on the 21st we even saw more firsttime Traders than recurring Traders on a single day the 20th was over here the 21st was over here now why does the number of first-time Traders matter it's because it shows that the investor base is growing right and the more people get into a token the higher the price can potentially go right it's new capital it's new people getting into a token that in the end increases the price long term and so I always like to look at charts like this on the 23rd unfortunately we've seen more recurring Traders than firsttime Traders and since the 23rd we aren't growing that much anymore and of course today has just started so we can't forget about the 24th this data is not yet complete now here's another very interesting chart and especially this part of the chart is interesting this is the retail investor as in how much of daily trading volume is generated by the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the me token that tends to increase over time and that's health because retail investors tend to not sell as quickly compared to large retail or Wales thus when the retail investors are now buying in more and more I believe that the price flow is also likely going to increase over time now this is a normalized chart right the simply just looks at the percent of trading volume done by those different cohorts here's the same chart but not normalized to 100% here it's shown in raw US dollar amount and we can clearly see again on the 21st attention peaked massively for mu and it stays at that elevated level now there is something interesting though and that is that the number of holders interestingly enough isn't growing so even though there were a lot of new firsttime Traders when we look at the number of wallets with 100,000 tokens here on the left so that's roughly $762 worth of the token we actually don't see that going up and we go another 10x from that so a minimum holding of $110,000 we've seen how this has stabilized a bit so that's in the last 2 weeks when we look at the number of Wales so that's a minimum holding now of $76,000 roughly that has grown in the last month but the growth had been relatively modest relative to the dump that preceded so how is it possible that the number of Wales is shrinking by more than 20% while the price is close to all-time highs I think it's because trading volume is moving from directly the Solana chain to the centralized exchanges so have a look at this we've still got 133% of trading volume on chain on radium but we do now have bit hump and bybit and okx also within the mix htx and gate.io are also involved there's also Perpetual Futures and that's especially active on binance so the very big boys are now entering as well and they're likely going to potentially manipulate the price especially in the direction most people aren't anticipating in other words if most people are now betting on falling prices on those centralized exchanges of this token if most people think that this is again a peak and that we're going to dump in cat in a darkg world and the centralized exchanges might simply buy up the token more and manipulate this upwards making money with liquidation fees so what happened in the past with the token might not be indicative of what's going to happen in the future simply because the nature of the trading is not changing as it's shifting from Solana onchain to the centralized exchanges if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly I try to be early feel

I'm going to give the actual information 100% accurately technically we'll talk about I don't have any preconceived notion in my head it'll go up it'll come down no what's in the chart let's start from the Fresh what happened it was fluctuating it was extremely bullish I want to give an example right now peper man classic example we we we all have an idea you have an idea about peper man that what happened in the past last two years that's this this is the this is the one token which pumped last two years Pepe is one of the most pumped token in the world it was an accumulation phase price pumped the most in the world same goes with clb it was an accummulation it's pumping a lot but then then then there is this one thing which comes into play we have seen double top 15 cents if you want to take a trade in this token man clv buy after breakout after breakout take a trade but if you are buying now if you are buying now you're going to lose everything in the market I can write it down in a piece of paper Frankly Speaking you will lose everything 100% money you will lose why because you are gambling with your money people who bought earlier they lost money people who are buying now they will lose money because see how many ways do we have in the market to make money we have two ways to make money in the market either buy at the day if I draw a horizontal R either buy at 30 cents if it'll be back to this level 30 cents take a trade over here at the bottom that's how you're going to make money in the market but buying the dip the other way we have after breaking out once price breaks 15 cents once price breaks 15 cents closing above it 0.16 take a trade over here either buy after breakout or buy the bottom that that's how you're going to make money in the market people who bought the top at 14 at 12 and people who are buying now they will lose because once they have lost money and people who are buying it they will lose because it'll be trying and if it and if you don't see if it don't break it'll be back I want to like remove this one to explain you clearly man clearly guys this is how crypto works so we are oh here it'll be going to it'll be breaking it'll be trying to break if it if it can break closing above it it'll be massive okay that's one of the scenario but if it don't if it don't break then it'll be back eventually so so so so that's why man whenever you take a trade play professionally either buy after breakout after confirmation 10 out of 10 times you're going to make money but this thing what I'm explaining you this will come with time where you are trusting yourself and you are thinking that you don't want to lose money and then make money people who are buying now they are keeping this thing in their head they want to make money but what if it goes against you you will lose everything did you think about that no I did not uh you will lose you deserve to lose money because you are lacking knowledge when you buy after breakout $0.16 good to go or maybe it'll be back to 3 cents good to go both ways you're going to paint money in the market oh before we de dive into this token price prediction I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which want to buy today I have a VIP when I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I give a coin that Buy ad 0.3 was our buying price since we bought what happened if I remove Pepe also we have bought and we are sitting at 7x profit Ada 3x profit your $110,000 you could have turned $330,000 by now haven't joined the VIP on the screen you can see my whats number DM me I'll be adding you into my VIP when to buy when to sell complete guidance crypto alerts if you are using coin base binance this group is for you why because all the information there's one coin which launched in the market USU did we buy if I so I give an update us us UL launched when to buy when to sell we'll let you know don't bu the top okay what happened price dropped it's dropping it was was at 38 I said that don't buy I'll let you know when to buy when to sell professionally we take trade we make money you name a coin which pumped in the world even xrp or maybe any coin we always buy the dip that's how we make money in the market xrp Pepe bong shba Dodge you name a coin man you name a coin it had 5 Z 341 bro it pumped a lot Dodge it pumped we are sitting at 7x profit in Pepe Dodge did we buy bro you name a coin I'm saying and I'll show you we have taken a trade at the bottom always always at the bottom that's how you're going to make money in the market and this thing like I have been doing for 10 years now so you need experience man you must be in the market for a decade for 5 years at least to have an idea I wish you all the best price prediction we have for clb that's approximately $10 $10 will come into the picture once we see price breaks $1 for short for long-term $10 us110 yes my friend you heard it right man after breakout it'll be massive 0.16 take a trade okay let's talk about few fundamental part about this token which really makes an impact in the market clva open over here it's a big one man indeed we all have an idea I have talked about this token earlier as well $93 million of market cap extremely low 159 like twice the market cap that's a real 1 billion coins we have in the market everything is top notch man it's a substrat okx venture portfolio BNB chain part of oh my God it's a really big binance coinbase okx c you name a platform it's available everywhere in the world it will be massive man price prediction for this bull market over $10 for shortterm man that's for sure for for bull market possibly $20 for bull market for shortterm $10 bare minimum bare minimum that the least I can think of $10 I wish you all the best have a nice day Che guys",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfB9fC3Dljs,"['BNB', 'XRP', 'Pepe', 'WHY',

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #mogcoin #mog #crypto","mop coin is a prime example of how Wales make money in crypto Wales manipulate the price in both directions up and down creating attention with that price movement attention translates into potential purchasing orders potential purchasing orders create an exit opportunity for the Wales let's have a look at how this exactly works we are not just talking about Theory here we are going to talk about data most people aren't looking at we're going to look at onchain data data that's available on the blockchain so let me show you the first video I made on mock that was pretty early before we had all of that price rally and so initially the video didn't perform that well it was an underperformer relative to an average video but now it starts to outperform as mock grows in price a second video followed why mock might crash that was on the 15th of March and have a look at this this is the 15th of March this is when mock went down by more than 50% but where are we going from here the nice thing about mock is that a lot of the trading volume still happens decentralized so directly on the blockchain we can actually see what's going on there and so let's have a look at retail versus whales and let's see what the retail investor is doing with mcoin let's see what the whale investor is doing with mcoin is one accumulating is the other one dumping what's actually going on to answer that question I have built a tool that I make available to the premium members by the way it's down below the Bitcoin trade.com you can plug in any ethereum token into this tool and look at the data on the left side we've got the number of wallets that at the current price hold roughly $1,000 worth of mck coin this is what I'd consider small retail this tends to push up sometimes during marketing efforts then slows down but it rarely drops a lot in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now a 10x from the left chart we've got at least $1,000 worth of m coins over here this isn't growing as consistently right just compare those two charts on the right side we see more dump pitch this is now the mega Wales this is now the wallets that have at least $100,000 worth of more coin those are all very long-term charts we can see that retail tends to accumulate over time doesn't tend to sell that much but in the last month specifically there was a lot of ups and downs what happened here why did the price from Peak to bottom suddenly Fall by 50% to then again double this is not driven by retail let me show you here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month and we can see a lot of accumulation happening since the 13th of May but the number of retail investors didn't really decline before that the number of medium-sized retail slightly grew not by much but maybe by 2% or so over that time frame the number of whales is pretty much constant maybe went down by one or two that's less than a percentage Point fluctuation here so how can the price double and get cut in half again when the number of holders isn't fluctuating that much I believe that's manipulation by the ultra big guys because have a look at what happens when mock coin suddenly goes up 50% in a day because that is what we are seeing right now have a look at this suddenly people are searching for mock coin again and this is a very old video there's also more traffic on this video so price volatility creates interest and interest translates into purchases and purchases translate into potential exits for the Wales so the Wales can manipulate the price up they can buy up more of the token so that more eyeballs get on the token to then sell that's how those ups and downs are generated in the price so what do I believe will happen over here I believe at some point we will see a crash again one way to time this is to Simply look at trading volume have a look here at the bottom whenever the trading volume is high the price tends to be very high as well whenever the trading volume tends to be low the price also tends to be rather low so if you're really interested in this long term I would not buy when trading volume is high buying when this is high is ultra dangerous because that's then when the price can go down again you want to be buying doing low attention you want to be buying when the whales feel like they need to manipulate the price again I will keep making updates on mock so if you want to see those feel free to subscribe I publish here regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow feel free to check out premium if you want to know what I'm currently buying feel free to also join our telegram the telegram is 100% free link is as well down below",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N95u44TUI5M,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'JUST', 'WHY', 'Ultra', 'MCOIN']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N95u44TUI5M/hqdefault.jpg,2024-05-21T05:30:05Z

#cryptotrading #bybit #OKX #bitcoinholders","what's up guys and welcome back to another video in today's video I'm going to be talking about five altcoins and one meme coin that you can't be missing out on right now as you know mem coins are actually absolutely exploding altcoins are absolutely exploding and there is money to be made if you're sitting in Bitcoin of course Bitcoin is one of the best assets in the world if not the best however I think there could potentially be more gains from another altcoin or a different meme coin potentially of course this is inherently very risky and do your own Financial research but in today's video I'm going to give you the five altcoins which you cannot afford to be missing out on in this market as of right now because in December they could be seeing a massive massive pump as we can see on the Bitcoin dominance chart right here guys we can see it is breaking out of this potential Rising wedge formation right here to the downside that means all the money is going to start flowing out of Bitcoin into altcoins into mem coins that is where the money is made as you know from the previous bull cycles the altcoin seasons are absolutely beautiful I wait for these moments for years simply because the gains are absolutely unmatched when it comes to bitcoin so let's get into today's video let's talk about first of all the total market cap we can see the total market cap of all crypto is exploding towards the upside not only that but the total market cap the total three market cap is also coming to its all-time high we can see right here it's getting very very close from an all-time high of about 1.13 trillion and this is the market cap excluding Bitcoin and excluding ethereum as you know ethereum is also a very very good project however you may be not going to get the gains which you're looking for if it's your first cycle or maybe it's your second cycle or third and you just want to make some more money probably Bitcoin or ethereum is not for you let's first of all talk about this first one which I want to talk about which is pyth Network as you know you've probably heard me mention this many times before is currently sitting at a market cap of about 1.83 billion with volume pretty pretty Prett decent volume to be honest and of course it's listed on all the major exchanges now why do I like this well first of all it's basically very similar technology to chain link in the previous runs chain link did really really well however I'm a little bit worried that chain link is a little bit of an old narrative coin and I want to be putting my money my Capital into new narrative coins and although the technology may not be as good as chain link I think the price and the chart could way way exceed it and again in the short term I really do think we are going to pump to the upside and reach this target right here of around 80 to 85 C which is in the golden pocket guys I really do think this is a good play if we look at it on the daily chart as well and take a zoom out it's also looking very very nicely it's looking very very bullish guys I've been talking about it on the channel ever since it was down here in this um bullish pattern right here about to break and also all the way back here before it pumped so I really do think it is good I do hold a a decent amount of pip however I will be buying more in the near term the second one which I want to talk about is a meme coin guys but before we get into that I want to update you about my trade over on bch X So currently right now I am in a t Tia long position and it's not a crazy amount a crazy trade however I really do think when we take a look at this it's going to do really really well we can see it's been very bullish over the past few weeks I think it's going to go on and outperform many different altcoins that's why I'm in this long position and that's why hopefully my liquidation price right there is going to be good enough to last and see the pump coming very very soon guys of course as you know I'm using bonex for pretty much all my trades right now it's no kyc and also you don't have to submit any documents you don't need to submit your ID your passport your driver license your utility bills all this headache you don't need you literally just need a name and an email and guys there's a massive bonus going on right now not these crazy bonuses where you see 30 or $50,000 because actually to get those bonuses you have to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars this is a realistic bonus that you watching this at home can go ahead and get there's only 100 uh available and probably most of them already gone as well so right here if you deposit only $1,000 you can get $200 in a trading bonus which is really really nice and if you don't want to deposit $1,000 $100 gets you $20 so you're getting a really really nice deposit bonus your name and your email or not not even your name just your email and your password and you can go ahead and get yourself an account and to start trading today so the second one I want to talk about is Bone book of meme now you may be saying Jack why are you bringing me a mem coin with a 650 million market cap that's already very very large well you will see exactly why I'm bringing it to you guys and I've been talking about it in in the charts because when you take a look at the chart right here guys and we take a bit of a zoom out it's starting to look very very bullish we can see this almost falling wedge like situation right here going towards the downside and when that breaks we're going to see a massive explosion in the price up to these price levels right here even if we pull out the FIB right here and we take a little bit of a look right there we can see that these key levels right there are in fact having levels of resistance right there right there and also right there combined with the downward sloping level of resistance and the 236 we can see that when we do in fact see a breakout from here we're going to see a push up to the 382 and then follow upward to the go run pocket now you've got enough time right now if you were going to go ahead and buy this of course do your own research but there is potential right here from the current price of around 120% just to that golden pocket and if we do see meme meme season take off like a lot of people are expecting it could fly even higher so I really really do think this one is going to do very very well in my opinion the next one which I want to talk about you may have seen it featured in videos recently it's called Zeta chain Zeta now I'm not the biggest believer in the tech of Zeta chain I'll be completely honest I don't know a crazy amount about it I'm just talking to talking to you about it from a technical standpoint when you're taking a look at the technical analysis on the charts because it is looking really really good with a market cap of only 5133 million it's not even too crazy to be honest and if we take a look at the uh Twitter socials right there it's got a nice big following right there over on Twitter so we can see that also when we take a look at the chart right here on Zeta we can see that it's looking really really nice so look at this chart right here it looks like it's about to go ahead and see a push towards the upside because it's about to break this 236 honestly this is one of the best charts in crypto right now if we are going to see a push towards the upside it's going to be looking really really nice right here we can see that if we just go ahead and break this level right here it's going to see around a 40% gain or to the golden pocket over 100% And it's really looking nice in my opinion I'm going to be buying this on spot and also entering a trade with it probably on bit next of course the link is down below no kyc no restrictions I'm going to be opening a very very nice trade on this probably a 2 to 3x so that my uh liquidation price can actually be under this level right here so if I can use the chart correctly if the liquidation price is going to be under here or at least under this kind of 50 c range probably it's going to be safe for the bull market so I think it's a really really good play we're seeing higher highs right there look higher highs all the way there and I think it's looking very very good the next one which I want to talk about the fourth one is in fact fat OD arcial super intelligence Alliance this has a massive market cap however I think it could do really really well this bull market of course we can take a look and it's been around for a while however I think it could do really really well with a massive pump in the O coin kind of mini market mini high right here back in March April of around $310 currently sitting at a187 and when we take a look at the chart it's looking pretty good because again we take a zoom out and take a look at the chart it's looking pretty nice so we got a lot of levels to look at and work with here first of all we just broke out of the 382 right there I am uh expecting some kind of a pullback to the 382 like we can already see right there there's a red Candlestick if we were to zoom in and take a look at that and then I'm expecting a further test of the 0. five and then the gold and pocket right there before going on to to reach the resistance right here at around $2.70 so I really think it is a good play probably not the best one on this list but definitely a good token to have in a well balanced portfolio in my opinion and I really think it could do well if we take a look at the price to the the percentage to the all-time high around 90% which is very good and I think potentially it could go higher with this bullish narrative this bull market the final one which I want to talk about guys is Aerodrome Finance now you probably heard me talk about this many times on my Channel or even on my second Channel allcoin Jack where I really get into some djm plays this is not so much to dgen with a market cap of over a billion however I think it could do really really well now if we take a look at the chart right here of Aerodrome Finance we can see that it's in a pretty good position right now actually it's inside already the golden pocket which definitely is not bad news it means that the price um I mean obviously buying below the0 236 would have been amazing and some of the coins on this list like Zeda are below that level so potentially they could do exactly what Arrow did right here however they haven't yet so you can catch them and hopefully see a little bit of a return but we can see right here it is in this golden pocket and it is looking to push higher and I think it can easily push the all-time high of about $240 from the current price it's around 55% till we get there and I really do think it is bullish right now and again I think it's going to do well over the next few months and uh weeks and of course it's uh on the base chain which I'm very very bullish on if coinbase decide to have an air drop on the base chain I think it could do really really well and um aerodrone finance will absolutely explode like pancake swap did back in the altcoin uh defi summer which we saw few years ago so I really think this is a good one and let's just recap and go over what we were talking about we got pyth right here and this is in no particular order we' got bom book of meme right here we've got Z chain right there we got artificial super intelligence Alliance fet right there and we've got aerod drone Finance right there and of course we've got that massive bonus right here on bitex if you did want to go ahead and trade and get a nice bonus right there I really recommend doing it no kyc no documents nothing you can trade without anyone knowing whether that be your wife or the government I don't know who that might be but you can leave that I can leave that up to you right there so go ahead and sign up to Big next and um go ahead and take a look at the charts of some of these o coins and I'll catch you in the next one",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFNB_fMVs0Y,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Safe', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FFNB_fMVs0Y/hqdefault.jpg,2024-12-01T10:32:25Z

top $1 in shortterm price going to hit the top $1 I want to talk about the accessibility from where we can buy it's available everywhere in the world yesterday when I checked and I was amazed man it's available everywhere you name a platform binance coinbase okx Co coin htx Bing X mxc bro available everywhere in the world it got the accessibility it's just like one breakout once price breaks boom this volume that we guys can see over here we all can see I mean like a billion dollars of volume we have in the last 24 hours it'll be five time highers it will be five time higher than the volume we have at the moment 5 billion in a day market cap $128 million we have which will be like 5 times to 10 times in upcoming days in short term for longterm over $10 it's a really huge crypto it'll take some time and once it breaks bro boom parabolic move a new alltime high we're going to see in the picture let's talk about this to clb technically what's going on and then we'll be back again to the fundamentals the use case um how it going to play out for long term everything in and out we going to talk about this one okay but before we Deep dive into to clb I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I give a coin that buy xlm and within 12 hours we double our money from xlm within 12 hours I don't know how many of you have joined my VIP if you haven't joined my VIP on the screen you can see my WhatsApp number DM me send a message hi hello on WhatsApp I'll be adding you into my VIP daily signals daily profit join right now all the information about the ones which are going nonstop in the market you'll be finding in my VIP if I just search oh see what was that uh token which launched the AC bro it launched 80% profit we made my friend with this token man it launched we took a trade it 70 80% profit within 24 hours two days back join right now daily two trades daily you can make money let's come back to our topic clv how we should go about it so now people who are watching this video guys want to take a trade in clv watch this video we are away from one breakout horizontal line if I draw from here it dropped massively we have seen a flash sale from 15 cent so we need closing we need closing like this we need closing like this closing above the resistance from where price dropped price dropped from this level 0.1 15 it dropped massively and now it'll be trying to break but we have to wait if you are buying now at 12 cents if you are buying now at 12 cents 14 cents 10 cents you're going to lose everything in the market you deserve to lose money you are buying solely because oh I'll I'll buy I'll make money in the market bro don't go that way you will lose when we zoom out the graph it pumped a lot it's at the top and if you are buying the top somebody has to lose money to make money in the market like I took a trade let's take an example let's take an example I took a trade at 0.03 I want to sell somebody has to buy the top trading means what buy and sell I don't want you guys to be exit liquidity no I don't want that so whenever you take a trade we only have two ways to make money in the market it's extremely bullish I read in and out about clv but we have to wait for breakout once price breaks this level breaks this level closing above it 0.15 good to go nobody in the world will resist you to take a trade on clb after breakout after breakout I going to make videos I myself will add into my portfolio after breakout because after breakout it won't be staying it won't be staying fluctuating over here no it won't be it'll be pumping on stop after that if I zoom out the graph what going to happen it going to pump up to $1 in short term for longterm $10 $10 us yes my friend you heard it right $10 it got that much potential CV don't take it for granted oh it's a project which one no my my friend it's matter of time and we need breakout man once price breaks this level from where price dropped 15 cents once we see closing a it man 0.154 take a trade buy technically chart is indicating you're supposed to take a trade it's not me I'm not projecting something no I'm just explaining what's in the chat that's my job it's a big one don't take it for granted it going to be massive massive bro it'll be parabolic it'll be pumping parabolic man with back to back marabo candles in upcoming days a big really is on but if you are buying now bro it'll it'll drop and you will lose everything in the market if it if it don't break if it don't break it'll be back it'll be back to where it started off and that's how you're going to lose everything in the market mark my words if you are buying and if it won't break it'll be back I have talked about over 6,000 videos I have like 6,000 coins I have talked about I have made over 6,000 videos as of now in crypto specifically I I have the experience man have been doing for 10 years now and if I'm saying something I told totally minute man I not sugar coating something no if my job is to like say something Crystal Clear if it's bullish I'll say as simple as that it's a big one we just need breakout if price breaks 0.15 4155 B it'll be massive $1 price prediction put a stop loss 0 13 a stop loss after break out but take a trade I wish you all the best have a nice day cheers guys leave your thoughts in the comments you have regarding clb have a nice day cheers

Cryptos I&#39;m Buying Before they Explode! #cryptocurrency #altcoins #crypto,This is a short list of altcoins I'm buying before they explode. I believe these coins have a higher chance of outperforming bitcoin before the end of the crypto bull run.,at the start of the year I began tracking 11 specific coins while many have already rallied some are still building up for their big move so far only Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high salana jasmi and render have performed well year-to dat with salana even reclaiming its 52- we highs meanwhile cardano and xrp have started pumping and seem poised to continue their upward momentum however Avalanche Gala hadera polka dot and ethereum have yet to show significant progress for this reason I plan to keep accumulating these coins in the coming days stopping only once they recover their 52e highs Avalanche polka dot and hadera are currently trading at roughly 2x below their 52- we highs while Gala lags further behind needing nearly a 3X move to reclaim its 52- we High,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxNpm_Htbs,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Cardano', 'Avalanche', 'Render', 'Gala']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WqxNpm_Htbs/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-15T16:17:18Z

space the market valuation of Corum hovering at approximately 8 cents presents a noteworthy observation as the coin reflects a pronounced downtrend from its historical Peak the desent from its all-time high raises legitimate concerns among investors prompting a closer examination of the underlying factors contributing to this decline one significant aspect to consider is the influence of broader Market sentiment the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile susceptible to Rapid shifts in investors sentiment and market dynamics the downward trajectory of corum's price may be intertwined with prevailing market conditions where height in uncertainty macroeconomic factors or fluctuations in Global Financial markets impact the valuation of digital assets moreover external economic conditions play a pivotal role in shaping the performance of cryptocurrencies Corum like the other digital assets is not immune to macroeconomic Trends regulatory developments or geopolitical events that can exert substantial influence on the entire crypto landscape investors often closely monitor these external factors seek and science of the potential Market movements and adjusting their strategies accordingly examining the internal dynamics of the quum project is equally crucial specific issues within the project itself ranging from developmental challenges to communication gaps could contribute to the observed downtrend investors May scrutinize the Project's updates Community engagement and adherence to the outline road map to gauge the Project's health and potential for Recovery to gain comprehensive understanding of Corum curent market performance it becomes imperative to conduct a thorough analysis of both external and internal factors Market sentiment economic conditions and Project Specific developments collectively shape this Co trajectory necessitating a new one's approach to interpretation one of the prominent concerns surrounding Corum revolves around its perceived deficiency in marketing efforts despite boosting a project with substantial promise there is a prevailing sentiment that the Corum team has not effectively conveyed its value proposition to the broader crypto Community this inadequacy in communication is posited as a potential contributor to a decline and investor confidence subsequently influencing a reduction in the token's overall value the cruxs of the matal lies in the imparative need for the Corum team to elevate its marketing strategies it's not merely about showcasing the technical PRS of the project rather it involves creating a compelling narrative that resonates with the larger crypto audience engaging in proactive Outreach social media campaigns and Community involvement are essential components in enhancing the visibility of Corum establishing a robust online presence coupled with transparent communication becomes Paramount in cultivating trust and confidence among potential investors the absence of Corum from major cryptocurrency exchanges such as coinbase qoin cracken and binance is identified as a substantial missed opportunity this underscores the potential benefits that could Ur from securing listing on these high-profile platforms such listing not only amplify the Project's visibility but also have the potential to trigger a positive shift in its market dynamics the Strategic imperative is clear the Corum team must prioritize efforts to secure listing on reputable exchanges beyond the sheer exposure being listed on wellestablished platforms lends a certain credibility and Trust worthiness to a project investors often view exchange listing as a vote of confidence in a token's legitimacy and potential for future growth therefore navigating the complex landscape of exchange Partnerships should be a central Focus for the Corum team to bolster the project standing in the competitive cryptocurrency market Corum standout feature revolves around its innovative concept of smart tokens a distinctive breed of programmable tokens designed to execute predefined functions autonomously this expresses admiration for this Forward Thinking approach loading the project for introduction a nowh dimension to token functionality the ability to program tokens to carry out specific task set smart token support offering a level of customization that surpasses traditional smart contracts and aspic is the potential for Swifter transaction execution facilitated by smart tokens the efficiency gains especially when compared to Conventional smart contracts signify a notable advancement the programmability of corum's token not only introduced a layer of automation but also promises a more streamlined and expeditious transactional experience catering to the growing demand for faster and more efficient blockchain operations equally praiseworthy es scorum strategic integration with a cosmos ecosystem through the inter blockchain communication IBC bridge this underscores the positive implications of this connectivity emphasizing its potential to enhance scalability and Foster broader integration possibilities by aligning itself with a cosmos Network Corum positions itself at the Crossroad of a diverse and interconnected blockchain landscape the IBC Bridge facilitates a seamless communication between different blockchains within the cosmos ecosystem opening up avenues for interoperability this strategic move not only aligns Corum with a wellestablished blockchain framework but also signifies a commitment to staying a breast of technological advancement within the broader crypto space the Strategic decision by the Corum project to distribute its token through a Fair air drop rather than resorting to an initial coin offering Ico this approach is viewed as commendable measure to ensure an equitable and widespread distribution of tokens by opting for a fair drop the project not only promotes inclusivity but also mitigates the risk of concentration of tokens among select few fostering a more decentralized ecosystem the total Supply being kept at 500 million is emphasize as a critical element contributing to positive tokenomics this limitation serve as a safeguard against potential issues like rug pools instilling confidence among investors that the project is committed to maintaining a stable and sustainable token Supply these

meeting the outline Milestones but also for maintaining and bolstering investors confidence the ever evolving real of cryptocurrency where developments occur rapidly regular updates and clear communication become the Bedrock of a robust Community despite prevailing challenges in the current bearish market sentiment I hold positive and optimistic stance on Corum the Project's Innovative token features coupled with favorable toomics and promising upcoming developments form the Bedrock of this optimism however it's crucial to underscore the imperative for more proactive marketing efforts securing listings on prominent exchanges and maintaining transparent communication these strategic elements are deemed essential for quarium success in navigating the highly competitive

is going down most altcoins are going down but kaspa is doing pretty well let's have a look at some data most people aren't considering let's look at onchain data let's look at long-term toomics let's also look at the recent news why Kasa is going up today so right now we are at a bit under 18 cents the price went up by 11% today it increased by 20% this week anded more than 7x this year the reason for the price increase today is in Announcement by Marathon digital 9 hours ago they tweeted that they've been actively Mining kaspa and Marathon digital is the largest of the crypto miners by market cap which very likely means that other crypto miners are also going to jump on this will'll build dedicated Hardware just for kaspa and that of course gives the whole project more legitimacy but let's zoom out a little bit more let's have a look at the long term on this channel I've already published several videos on kaspa and the video published 9 month ago discusses a lot of fundamentals usage statistics token inflation Etc feel free to check it out kaspa many things to like but it was one of the better performing videos on this channel so have a look at this this is the blue line that's the performance of that video in Gray is a typical video and so I talked about K when the price was still at 4 cents again now we are above 17 cents so if this is your first time researching about kaspa maybe consider following channels like this I try to be early and I do publish videos fairly regularly now on this channel I try to be as objective as possible I don't just randomly sh cryptocurrencies I try to look at both the pros but also the cons let's have a look at some cons for Kasper one thing I don't like is the onchain usage statistics so this comes from Casper litics tocom this is the number of transactions over time the chart starts in October of 2023 and we don't really see much growth here unfortunately here's the number of unique sending addresses also unfortunately not really any clear growth same is true for the number of unique receiving addresses or the average number of transactions per accepting block so it doesn't seem like there is a vast influx of onchain usage right kaspa is its own blockchain or rather block deck right it's the improved version of a blockchain there isn't that much usage of the kaspa technology so far because unfortunately there isn't any smart contract capability you can pretty much only send Casper tokens from one wallet to the next the kaspa team is targeting to launch Smart contract capabilities but that hasn't yet happened the momentum around kaspa though is super super impressive what we've got behind me here is not a kaspa chart what we're seeing here is a long-term Bitcoin chart right on a logarithmic scale starting in 2010 and kaspa is very often compared with Bitcoin because it's also proof of work because it's also fairly distributed right with a fair launch all the tokens went to the minus and so this is the long-term Bitcoin chart now this here is the long-term kaspa chart a specific kaspa chart it's kaspa relative to ethereum there are very very few altcoins that have such a nice chart this as well is a logarithmic scale so each time we go up by roughly this distance here we double in the price so the kaspa price has doubled several times it continues to double and of course every now and then we have our crashes similar to bitcoin but this is a very very nice long-term chart according to this chart we've got a potential risk of losing 25% roughly versus ethereum but a potential gain of almost 3 Xing from here there are a lot of comparables also in terms of tokenomics this here behind me is the inflation rate of Bitcoin over time so we all know how the Bitcoin Supply gets cut in half every four years and we are currently at 0.85% per enm of additional Bitcoin hitting the market through the minus here's the same kind of chart for kaspa the reduction here happens every month it doesn't happen every four years so it's a smoother line that's then how the supply develops over time so instead of looking at the newly issued tokens at every point in time we look at the total Supply and at the point of recording of this video 84% of all of kaspa is already circulating there isn't that much inflation anymore at least in terms of percentages there is a bit of a problem though but more on this later let's have a look at the inflation in the next 12 months so it's currently June of 2024 let's have a look at the total Supply in June of 2025 that's 26.7 billion and the Supply right now is 23.6 billion so one year from now we will have roughly 10.3% more Supply the market cap of kaspa right now is 5 billion so in order for the price to stay stable we need to have at least $500 million of purchasing in the next 12 months every day 1.3 $1.4 million has to flow into kaspa now there's many ways to buy the KAS token right again kaspa is its own blockchain so most people will simply just use centralized exchanges there is a reped version though that can be bought on the ethereum Chain so on ethereum you have KAS to be bought on Unis Swap and the liquidity pool is almost 2 million in size so there is some liquidity here the nice thing about ethereum based tokens is that we can actually do quite nice onchain analytics have a look at this this is the number of holders over time for the ethereum based wrapped K token on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 10,000 k at the current price that's roughly $1,800 that's what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail it's another 10x from the left so that's now1 18,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's $180,000 all cohorts are increasing their Holdings over time that is good but let's see how much buying pressure there really is maybe starting from beginning of the year where we had roughly 700 holders to today roughly 900 a Delta of 200 new holders that have at least $1,800 in the token that's 360k worth of purchases we've got 10 times the amount over here in the middle but we also only have 30 to 40 wallets that increased over here so maybe that's another 500k or so and for the fun of it let's also double this here on the right so maybe in total on the ethereum Chain we got roughly a million dollar worth of purchases of KAS again since beginning of the year so that would be roughly 2 million of purchases over the span of one year but as said we need at least 500 million for the price to be stable now the big question is how much of purchases happen on ethereum versus on the centralized exchanges this is incredibly hard to answer because unfortunately the decentralized exchanges aren't even listed here most trading volume happens in Black boxes in gate.io and in mexc and in bybit qoin on top of that we've also got some leverage through Perpetual Futures through binance and bybit again Mexi and so that makes it very hard to estimate how much of this purchasing is actually natural versus potentially inflated or manipulated we can definitely say that momentum is positive we can definitely say that people are buying and the long-term relative valuation chart to ethereum is very very pretty and the token inflation with 10% per enom relatively speaking isn't that bad the only question is since the market cap is already 5 billion 10% of that is 500 million and that Supply expansion needs to be absorbed by all kinds of purchasers so of course by retail but also by the larger institutional players casine isolation looks quite nice the problem is that all of crypto doesn't look that great right now this is the stable coin market cap over time it's either Contracting or expanding this here by the way was the Tera Luna collapse so this is when the anchor protocol failed money afterwards was flowing out of crypto that then turned around in October of last year but since April of this year we barely see any more expansion unfortunately and we have seen what happens when there's no expansion for a while right D5 protocol could blow up if history was to repeat itself oneon-one again then we would see such an implosion in July 10th of July of this year I doubt that this will happen but still I prefer to be in a market that expands when the market isn't expanding it's 100% player versus player right you need to make better calls than the average Trader and most people don't make better calls especially when you've got a diversified portfolio right there's very few alt coins that did well in the last month and so fundamentally I personally approach the market differently at the moment I don't try to find the one or two winners that might do well Kasper could be among those winners but what I rather do is I try to bet on falling prices since the majority of altcoins is likely going to underperform in a market that's not expanding why not simply just bet on the Hast deck instead of trying to find the needle in the Hast deck right the one winner among all of those losers so I personally I am shorting alt coins right now and I like to short alt coins that have a very quickly expanding Supply that expand quicker in Supply than kaspa this is one of the alt coins that I'm shorting this is again a relative performance this time to ethereum and I'm currently making money as this chart continues to go down since beginning of the year this went down by roughly 50% and so this channel has a premium membership where I talk about how to short altcoins where I've got tutorials how to use web 3 to short altcoins but also disclose what altcoin this specifically is to Short so I ran the numbers if you've got roughly $3,000 in the short then premium is 100% for free so you need to have a few th000 in order to make this worthwhile if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough there's also a free telegram feel free to check it

again it's already very painful just watching the presidential debate between Biden and Trump seeing now even an assassination attempt on Trump is just the cherry on top now in this video I don't want to talk about the implications on Democracy Etc this is in the end a crypto Channel I want to talk about what kind of impact this had on the M token because here's the thing with global events Like This Global News create attention and attent turns into purchases of related tokens as we have seen with ma the price went from $6 all the way to above $10 in a matter of a few minutes but now we are coming back down could the price potentially continue to rise from here given that the chances are pretty high that Trump will win this election I want to look at onchain metrics I want to look at the buyers and sellers so let's start off with the balance that's been held by Mex C that's the main centralized exchange of MAA which holds currently 3.3% of the token here's the balance development over time Mech C is accumulating potentially because customers simply demand for the token right they want to buy the token on the centralized exchange and then the centralized exchange goes on chain to actually do the purchases and so we are at an all-time high in the Mexi Holdings and the tension on MAA is large especially r relative to the liquidity on chain because have a look at this this is the ethereum chain and the Trump token is the 17th largest token on chain it's got 9 million worth of liquidity half of that is W ethereum the other half is the Trump token so there's currently 590,000 tokens on chain in that pool on Unis swap Maxi holds roughly three times of that now when I looked at the onchain holder development when I looked at the buyers and sellers detail but also the whales I noticed something that is a bit off that is a bit concerning at the first glance everything looks very nice as in the number of retail investors is growing over time mediumsized retail as well and whales as well so what we see here on the left is the number of wallets that hold at least 100 ma tokens so that's $770 worth of the token in the middle we've got a 10x in minimum holding so that's at least $7,700 worth of the token and on the right we've got $77,000 worth of the token so it's always a 10x from one another the Wales have stopped purchasing since the middle of February of this year but the number of Wales is actually not going down it's simply just flat but since February of this year the number of retail wallets grew by almost 3x so it's really a retail driven rally however here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month and here is what's concerning the number of whale investors didn't really change much medium-sized retail grew by roughly 10% and small retail grew by roughly 20% so one would expect that in the last month this is where those charts start that in the last month the price should have gone up there was mainly adoption right there was more and more people jumping on the token but in the last month the price unfortunately went down by 37% so Mexi is accumulating small retail is accumulating as well the number of whale wallets is pretty much stagnant where does all this selling pressure come from I do not have an answer unfortunately I do not know who's selling here but there's some kind of selling happening that's not that visible on chain I thought maybe it's leverage maybe it's manipulation via derivatives via Perpetual Futures but there's also very little trading volume on those Perpetual Futures right there's no action here either and so because of that question mark because I don't know why the price went down in the last month while Bitcoin went in aggregate almost flat right it was only a loss of 5% while at the same time we see how the investor base is growing because I can't explain this poor performance I personally have to stay away unfortunately I'm not going to buy ma but if you've got an idea why the price performed so poorly and why it might not in the future where the selling pressure was coming from and why this might stop then please please let me know I want to see the data that shows what's actually going on I'm really looking forward to any kind of comment that might reveal what this puzzle is all about if you've got telegram I'm also very much looking forward to discussing this

now it's the Bull Run of meme coins and mother iy is running very well let's have a look at the onchain data most people aren't considering to find out how much longer this really could last because here's something very useful about the mother igy token most of the trading still happens in decentralized finance it still happens on chain thus we can directly look at the data the data is not hidden in the black box of centralized exchanges it's all open at the public Ledger So currently the mother token is at 16 cents we more than doubled in the last week this month we more than eight X and the fully diluted market cap is still just at 161 million now what does that mean 161 million let's have a look at meme coins ordered by market cap we have to scrore quite a lot down all the way to the tokens that are in the 300s Apu is slightly larger Co Eno is slightly smaller but why am I then discussing a token that's that small what's interesting about this that I'm looking at something that low in the ranking the answer is over here what we've got here is dexc screen.com and we are looking at the Solana chain and we all assets on the Solana Chain by their liquidity pool size so how much capital is actually on chain locked up in various tokens and the mother Iggy token is at rank number 10 it's actually the 10th largest token on chain it might be at rank 300 something in terms of market cap but what really matters is how much liquidity is locked up in the token and there we are at Market Rank 10 on Solana now let's have a look at a few onchain metrics let's find out how many new investors versus recurring Traders there are in the token because if a lot of new people jump on the token that would be good that means that the investor base is growing and a growing investor base means potentially a rising price unfortunately right now we do not see a lot of firsttime Traders we had a massive influx on the 29th of May so that was over here subsequently the price Rose by more than 10x but then this somewhat flipped the number of recurring Traders and first time Traders were pretty equal most days and on the 7th of June we mainly had recurring Traders we didn't see that many new people coming in anymore today the data hasn't yet finished so we're actually not that inactive in the token so the 7th of June is a bit problematic here's the 7th of June on the chart this is when the price stopped Rising somewhat ideally we also want to see how the very large investors get into a token right the Wales they tend to make the right calls if there's a lot of trading volume happening among the larger wallets the wallets that have more than $100,000 worth of the token that would be good unfortunately we don't see this here yet the trading volume by large retail tends to rather Decline and the trading volume by small and mediumsized Retail tends to rather in increase and so here's the big question it looks like the growth so far had been quite organic and not manipulated as in the amount of view seems to be relatively reasonable relative to the number of followers on Twitter the number of subscribers in telegram also is pretty much aligned with 15,000 the number of holders on chain is at 27,000 so that also makes sense and again most trading volume happens on decentralized exchanges which is good this does give us some upside potential in case we do see a listing on centralized exchanges that of course tends to push up the price and so this is usually how it starts there's a lot of liquidity on chain and over time the centralized exchanges tend to buy into the token as they buy into the token at some point there will be a listing when there's enough tokens for Market making available and with those listings interest of course also increases and with increased interest we see a rising price so I believe there is a lot of potential upside here still the number of holders isn't huge the liquidity on chain is already established but currently there isn't a lot of momentum we do need to see another push so that's true for the number of investors that aren't growing quickly enough but it's also true for the General altcoin market unfortunately we do not see a lot of new inflows of stable coins so what we've got over here is the stable coin market cap over time we had an expanding crypto ecosystem up until the middle of April since then there isn't too much Fiat getting converted into stable coins anymore so the expand has halted and that of course also hurts altcoin prices there's one more interesting thing that I noticed in the data today have a look at this here today the number of buys was 19,700 the number of sales 8,000 the buying volume and selling volume was pretty much balanced out so there was a bit more selling that's why we see the falling price the number of buyers and sellers is also relatively equal with the sellers somewhat overhanging so what you can see here is that the buyer tend to buy much more often than the sellers so there are people or specific wallets that are currently buying several times so there are dollar cost averages in here this could be a sign of centralized exchanges buying low here under low volume when there's not a lot of activity so yes this is a very risky token it does have a lot of upside as well but there's definitely a bet on centralized exchange listings I am planning to buy some of the token as well not a lot but a bit I'm planning to I haven't bought yet right so this is not a channel where I buy beforehand and then release a video and then pump and dump a coin I'm not doing that I don't like this conflict of interest I might potentially buy some after this video several hours after releasing of this video I will continue to make updates on the mother token on this channel so feel free to subscribe a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow in case you've got telegram then feel free to check out the channel the

6900 Price, SPX 6900 Price Prediction, SPX 6900 longterm, SPX 6900 Tokenomics,  #spx6900 #memecoin #crypto","SPX 6900 one of the main meme coins on ethereum is not having such a great time it's down almost 30% in the last 7 Days the question is does it make sense to buy this dip now let's have a look at some onchain analytics let's try to figure out how much longer this crash potentially could last or if it makes sense now to take opportunity of those low prices now here are the leading trending tokens on ethereum ordered by their liquidity pool size and SPX 6,900 is at number five with 10 million worth of liquidity a market cap of 650 million and so we are currently at roughly 70 cents we are down slightly today but this week we are down 27% as so many meme coins are yet in the last month if you were early you made more than a 3X and in the last year it was almost a 50x now this is not the first video on SPX 6900 on this channel I published several videos in the past and yes you're right my thumb na game is not necessarily the best in crypto but the reason why I talk about this is I want to share some YouTube statistics so the very first video on SX 6900 on this channel was published on the 30th of September that video though did not get that many views it even got a few dislikes subsequently the follow-up videos got more views the recent video is still relatively fresh and has to do some catchup and so have a look at this the first video performed pretty average so that video is here in blue the average video is in Gray the follow-up video however outperformed and so that's the dilemma with YouTube right when I publish a video on a cryptocurrency that's not yet that well known and the video doesn't perform that well either when then at some point the price appreciates and the attention appreciates and then potentially the upside isn't that much there anymore that's then when the video outperforms and that's probably why a lot of tokens that you see on YouTube aren't necessarily the best buys the algorithm is simply working against us so if you want to get those videos very early feel free to subscribe potentially even hit the notification right if I make a video on a cryptocurrency you've never heard before maybe it might be worth watching because check this out the first video on SPX 6900 was when the price was still at 11 cents and after that we went up by 800% roughly the subsequent videos when then the price doesn't do that well anymore of course it did get more YouTube views now I believe that crypto is currently splitting in two direction we've got on the one hand the very serious Bitcoin investor the people that simply buy Bitcoin spot that believe in Bitcoin being the hardest money some people also buy via the ETF then there are the other investors the more speculative money that want to get the 10x maybe 100x returns those are the people that buy the meme coins now the issue with that split is that the middle pretty much gets decimated so the large D5 protocols they all underperform Bitcoin the very large meme coins also don't tend to to do that well have a look at this table which shows only meme coins and they are ordered by their market cap every single of those meme coins lost in the last week however when we look at the meme coins that performed rather well last week all of them have small market caps so we've got 50 million over here 50 million over here 40 over here we do have some meme coins that have a few hundred million market cap but it's definitely not in the billions and SPX 6900 unfortunately is also over here it's already got 7 100 million so 0.7 billion it's unlikely that it's going to make a 10x from here and rival Sheba enu I'd go so far to say that it's even unlikely that we'll see a 3X from here at least relative to the rest of the memec coin Market because that would put SPX 6900 even above Bonk now on this channel I like to look at onchain metrics I like to look at who's currently buying and selling where is currently the momentum shifting so let's have a look at that data on ether scan we've got more than 20,000 holders now not all of those holders are created equal let's have a look at the people that actually move the price what we've got over here is a wallet count based on minimum holding thresholds on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 tokens in the middle 10,000 tokens on the right 100,000 tokens now 1,000 SPX 6900 tokens is equal to exactly $700 at the current price in the middle we've got a minimum holding of exactly $7,000 on the right a minimum holding of $70,000 now we see how the rally that started in September of this year was mainly driven by small retail the number of small retail investors almost forx the number of whale investors only grew by maybe 20% or so now in the last month we still 3x in the price here's the same kind of charts with the same thresholds but cut off only for the last month we again see how retail buys how this buying is now somewhat slowing down we see how mediumsized holders also buy but here the buying is slowing down even more and the whales they rather tend to hold maybe slightly even sell now let's have a look at the pace of retail holder growth let's assume that the growth continues compared to what we've seen in the last two weeks so we are slowing down obviously let's say we stay at the current level then we are growing by roughly 10% within 2 weeks or 20% per month that's still quite fast a lot of meme coins don't have those numbers the current drop is obviously driven by the General market but we can also see that returning users are taking some profit so the number of returning users is higher than number of you users per day we can see that on average 60 to 70% of trading volume is generated by returning users not by new users entering the token now it's nice to see that the number of retail investors is growing it's also nice to see that especially recently the number of buyers outpaces the number of sellers so when we see the price going down it's just because some whales take profit but just have a look at this in the last few days we pretty much every day saw 60% buyers versus maybe 40 % sellers a real shift towards buying and so I will buy some SPX 6900 after publishing of this video as well I don't hold any right now but I will buy some after this video several hours after publishing I never buy a token before publishing a video so I don't pump and dump on this audience I don't buy secretly to then afterwards publish to then sell when you are buying I always buy after publishing because I don't like that conflict of interest now there's one more data point that makes me very optimistic about SP x6900 and that's the influencers they are buying now as well so in the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin st.com we're tracking various influencers and have a look at this Kyle chesse bought regularly into SPX 6900 across the rubikon also just recently bought again we track in total 12 wallets by Kyle chesse he's got more than 100,000 subscribers we also tracking Alex Becka with more than 1.4 million subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets not all of them are wellknown we also tracking Crypt Benta 1.1 million subscribers 33 of their wallets are tracked in premium and so besides just onchain analytics besides looking at the aggregated data looking at what the Insiders are doing and looking at the top Traders does make a lot of sense we got a lot of very nice signals very early on and so I even made a dedicated tutorial course just on that topic how can we find different influencer wallets how can we then track them and how can we then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking so that's eight dedicated tutorial videos just on the wallet tracking topic but in total there's more than 100 tutorial videos also on portfolio Management on blockchain analytics not just on wallet tracking once we've got a trading signal we of course discuss them in dedicated groups they're also part of the premium Telegram and of course I share my own trades as well for example I'm shorting ethereum relative to bitcoin and I publish videos regularly on how I see the market as a whole so feel free to check it out it's currently 125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% I like the retail holder growth of SPX 6900 I'm going to buy some tokens if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

now let's see if this week long rally is finally turning around and if you're going to see a dump or if long-term adoption actually continues let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people are not considering now here's the price action in the last few days we are down from the top of almost $1 to now 63 cents a loss of 33% this might sound like a lot but in the grand scheme of things this could be a start of something potentially much worse because that 33% decline is this little blip over here in this longer term chart we have seen SPX 6900 going down by 95% now it's interesting to see that today the number of buyers is way larger than the number of sellers but still the buying volume is not equaling the selling volume thus we are down by 7% so it seems like a case of the Wales and of the early buyers now taking profit now the onchain analytics are a bit more complex because there are three versions of the token there's one on ethereum this is where most capital is with 16,000 holders but there's also a version on the base chain with 14,000 holders and of course the casino on Solana is running as well there we've got 18,000 holders now this is not the first video of SPX 6900 on this channel I covered it actually very early so the first video was published 2 weeks ago at a time when the price was 11 cents and even after that correct we are up almost 6X now here's what's interesting about YouTube when you talk about a token that's not yet popular but might become popular in the future the views are actually not that great so as said I published several videos on SPX 6900 and the first video with the lowest price it tended to be initially an underperformer nobody was interested the last video though where the price was much higher was an outperformer and so that's unfortunately how the algorithm works right it spreads whatever is popular but whatever is popular tends to be also high in price so if you don't want to miss the next video when I talk about something early feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various meme coins regularly on this channel now let's dive into the current metrics of SPX 6900 and let's start with the ethereum chain on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 1,000 SPX 6900 tokens at the current price that's roughly $600 we go a 10x for the middle chart that's $6,000 for the right the minimum holding is $60,000 so there's $7,500 small r Wallets on ethereum there's only 800 such Wallets on base and there's 4,800 such Wallets on Solana so it looks like we can pretty much ignore the numbers on base price Discovery definitely doesn't happen here now let's compare the price development in the last month with the holder development in the last month because initially we had our very beautiful rally but then we're turning around since the 13th of October now here's the last month on ethereum with the number of holders so now we don't look at the all time time charts we only look at the last month and so the number of small retail holders continues to grow despite the price retracing medium-sized retail so all the wallets with at least $6,000 at current prices also continues to grow if we then go another order of magnitude up though so $60,000 this is where we see the turnaround now that turnaround did not happen on the 13th of October it already happened around the 7th 8th and 9th of October this is where accumulation some what stalled and then the selling started happening on the 10th 11th and 12ths and so have a look at this again right since the 10th of October the price action is getting a bit more choppy and so if the whales continue to sell we probably continue to see heightened volatility now there's one Central metrics that's especially important for meme coins and that's new investors are there actually new people coming into the token and this is potentially also accelerating because the more new people jump onto a project the higher the price can sustainably go now here's that data again we're looking at ethereum and we see the number of new users per day and this peaked on the 12th of October since then is coming down and we have to ignore the last data point here on the 17th of October because the day hasn't yet finished so again that's the data on Eve and here's the same data on Solana pretty much the same picture the peak is happening somewhere around the 9th maybe 12th of October on the left side is the user count on the right side is a transaction count the transaction count peaked on the 12th of October now we can also compare the firsttime traders to the recurring Traders and a clear flip has happened after the number of firsttime Traders peaked so now we see the existing Traders battling against one another not so many new Traders coming in and I believe that the whales know about things like this that's why they're exiting crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the people that have better data the people that are better informed they tend to make the money right they tend to beat the market and so I like to look at what the people are doing that have most money that tended to make the best calls in the past and they're clearly not accumulating as quickly as they used to so yes the number of buyers tends to grow now relative to the number of sellers this by the way is again on Solana and yes in the last weeks the price of course could rise with that heightened trading volume but still just the number of buyers exceeding the number of sellers does not necessarily help when the whales on average have more than 100 times more holding than the retail investor right we've seen this at the beginning of this video the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers but the buying volume does not exceed the selling volume so the sellers simply have more money and so on the left we've got the token balance by holder size small and medium retail is getting more of the overall token Supply or in other words the whales are selling the small guys are buying and that selling pressure is pretty significant so the whale Holdings went from 60 million worth of value all the way down to 42 million while the value for small retail barely changed because they continue to buy and so there's the hope of some people that there will be more centralized exchange listings but I'm not sure if that's going to happen if the whales continue to sell the token is listed on mexc but the trading volume isn't actually that large price Discovery really happens directly on chain on radium for Solana and on Unis swap for ethereum that's where all the trading volume is and so this YouTube channel has a premium Community as well and we talk about all kinds of all coins and of course that also includes SPX 6900 a shout out to guok and Tokyo tracks who are very active in onair analytics in the channels here's aosst of some onchain data on October 13th where shared that SPX is likely going to Peak and so our members have taken profit again the 13th of October was over here was the perfect timing and so feel free to learn onine analytics yourselves there's all kinds of different tutorials in premium there's a whole course just dedicated to finding other wallets but there also videos on micro indicators on portfolio management Etc hundreds of videos now to improve your crypto game of course you use those onchain Antics not only to time the market we also use it to monitor other successful Traders and so have a look at all of those SPX trades made by Kyle chesse in the early days we've got 12 of its wallets monitored always giving us an alert whenever he buys and sells and of course all the graphs all the statistics that you have seen in this video are part of a tool set of Premium as well well so there's a tool for the ethereum based blockchains there another tool for Solana and of course also a tutorial video on how to use all of this there's even videos on how to build tools like this yourself now to sum it all up I don't have a crystal about either where SPX is going the only thing I can say is that the whales are actively dumping they are selling their tokens and that does depress the price our members are taking profit and are looking for the next opportunity I believe that's the right thing to do if you got something out this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and of course looking forward to seeing you on premium as well

from this more than 26% loss in the last 7 Days let's have a look at the onchain metrix and try to figure out is this potentially an opportunity to buy the dip because with onchain data with the data that most people aren't looking at we get an advantage over the people that just draw random lines on price charts we want to know the things most people are ignoring So currently we are at a bit under 1 cents the price went down by more than 26% in the last week now why are we even bothering with book of meme why are we even bothering with the B token the answer is in this table book of meme is still the second largest cryptocurrency on the Solana chain with a liquidity of 53 million it's only below slur it's larger than anything else on chain and it's not just large on chain it's also been traded on centralized exchanges quite a lot this is pretty un common either we see a lot of trading on chain in the early days and then a lot of the volume moves over to the centralized exchanges or alternatively we see already the launch at the centralized exchange and we never have that much on chain for Book of meme we see trading on both sides it's very interesting and the trading doesn't just happen on the spot market so on binance htx and gate.io it also happens on the Perpetual Futures market so people are actually betting with leverage and derivatives on the book of meme price and that's mainly on binance now here's a mistake that a lot of people make a lot of people simply just look at the US dollar price valuation but the problem is that alt coins are very much also impacted by the underlying ecosystem token right when Solana goes down by 50% then book of meme is also likely going to go down to a similar degree if not even more and so in my opinion it's a mistake to look at this chart the book of meme to US dollar chart because simply looking at this it's also not obvious why the price turned around at the levels but when we look at the book of meme relative to Solana chart we see those supports way more clearly and currently we are again very close to such a support and what's the potential upside if you just look at this price chart if you don't yet look at the onchain metrix which will follow in a second the potential upside relative to so is easily 40% if not even a bit more so here's the trading volume on chain on the Solana chain directly not on the centralized exchanges and this is segmented by what size a ton of activity in the early days not so much right now let's have a look at what fraction of Wales large retail and small retail mediumsized retail currently dictates the recent price action that's in this chart over here so I simply just normalize the trading volume to 100% look at the share of trading volume based on different segments small retail is wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and Wales is everything above 100,000 now we notice how small retail tended to grow over time but how in the last two days it was mainly medium-sized retail that's dominating everything so it's the wallets between a th000 and $10,000 that are currently buying book of Meme and I interpret this as a positive sign because this is how crypto goes right crypto is both a game of skill and luck and the more you play the game the more you trade the more tokens get ated to the people with more skill right the luck component balances itself out thus if more and more tokens are currently been traded by the larger wallets I see this as a good sign smart money is getting in so attention is super low medium-sized retail is buying relative to Solana in the price chart we are very close to a support and so if crypto as a whole can expand right if new money flows into crypto again which unfortunately we haven't seen that much in the last 6 weeks but if we see a turnaround again if we see an expansion of crypto again then I believe book of meme can likely outperform I already made two videos on book of meme on this channel one published two months ago another one published 2 weeks ago and I will continue to make updates in the future if you're interested in those updates feel free to subscribe again I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram feel free to join us

token is a direct competitor to render and to aash so we're looking at decentralized GPU Computing let's have a look at tokenomics let's have a look at the beers let's have a look at how much longer this price could potentially R so here we are we are at almost 9 cents up almost 40% today very shortly after launch and I'm not going to run you just through the website and sell you the marketing Jazz this is an objective Channel I'm not just going to shill you hoping to buy the coin and dump on you because here are the reasons why most people argue that you should be buying aier a year has 20 times the GPU power of the render Network and 45 times the computing power of Akash render is currently valued at roughly 5 billion Akash at 1.3 billion and AIA has currently a fully diluted market cap of 3.7 billion note there's only 9% floating here this is a first hint towards toomics the supply of the 8 each token will more than 10x at some point so demand has to grow at least at the same pace for the price just to stay stable that does not mean that the price has to crash now though because we have seen very similar projects in the past and they initially ried quite a bit but more on this later so things in general look very healthy the Twitter account has almost a million followers so 875,000 followers on Twitter and of course a lot of that excitement comes from the GPU Demand right Nvidia is currently doing very very well and so people are looking for the next best thing that might potentially have a levered effect on GPU demand so if the gains of Nvidia stock isn't enough for you then maybe a year is an option but let's have a look at the demand and Supply Dynamics because that's in the end what determines supplies right it's the intersection between supply and demand so eighth year is decentralized GPU power and the early adopters were able to buy a note a checker note that sale has ended though prior to selling those notes a year raised 32 million in funds there's more information on Ico drops who those investors are and most of those investors already made a pretty nice return here's the average Roi and so here's the thing right when there is support by Venture Capital that's potentially good to build out the project but it also means that those vure capitalists might be selling their tokens at some point depressing the price so again demand has to grow as quickly as tokens unlock let's have a look at tokenomics let's have a look at the unlocks so here we've got the token distribution of a year we've got our airdrop we've got the investor allocation we've got half of the tokens going to Checker nodes and compute providers more on this later 15% to ecosystem 5% to advisers 12.5% to the team how will this hit the market the team has to wait 18 months there's another airdrop 8 months from now where the supply will double another 8 months from now where the supply compared to today will triple the Development Fund is already very vesting linearly over 24 months the treasury is vesting as well the investors are going to dump in 12 months and the Checker notes and Edge notes are also contributing in the next four years so what does this mean this means of course an expanding Supply and what can potentially stop the depression of the price when the supply increases its demand may be for the computing power its demand maybe for the notes that have to potentially be bought with the token and what happens when you have to buy a note with a token that in the end paids out the rewards in the same token we've got something that resembles Pony nomics right I'm not saying this in a judgmental way there is ways to make money with Ponzi schemes but in case we've got these kind of pony nomics going on here you need to find an exit point at some point so don't hold this forever more on this later when we compare this to another very similar crypto project so let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's have a look at how many people are currently holding the at H token there's two versions of the token one on ethereum one on arbitrum the ethereum token is still the main version at the moment there's 35,000 holders but only 1,600 holders have more than $1,000 worth of the coin 200 wallets have more than $10,000 worth of the coin and 47 holders have more than $100,000 worth of the coin we are still very early this is not a lot of holders yet will there be any dilution because of listings on other centralized exchanges maybe there is no listing yet on binance on on coinbase and when the listing gets announced of course we will see a short-term price hike so far the main centralized exchanges are okx gate.io bybit and htx now here's a parallel I'd like to draw and that parallel is to a crypto project called helium helium built a decentralized Wi-Fi infrastructure so you bought a helium Noe you had to buy this with real cash and then that note paid out h&t tokens over time the initial purchases of the note pushed up the h&t price but then when the rewards were paid out and not a lot of people used the infrastructure then the h&t price gradually went down so there was not enough demand for usage of this wi-fi infrastructure and with a lack of demand for the infrastructure there wasn't enough demand for h&t thus the price depressed when Supply increased now let's have a look at how long the party lasted so again let's check out this chart this was a pretty long ride for almost one year and you could make massive money with the this at the top though the market cap was at 5 billion the situation with ath year is slightly different we are already at 3.5 billion this needs to go to 1 million or March buyers now will make millions this is how you get the clicks on YouTube but this is not how you beat the market to beat the market in crypto you need to be better informed than the rest you need to be better skilled than the rest you need to do better blockchain analytics you need to track other people's wallets and know what is the Smart money doing it's the the boring educational content that forms skill that doesn't perform so well on YouTube though that's why I created the premium membership feel free to check it out we are tracking influencer wallets to find out what they are buying before promoting this on YouTube we've got a lot of tutorials to help with onchain analytics to help with wallet Discovery and of course there are also plenty of chats where we help each other and also one-on-one conversations with me so I'm messaging every premium member oneon-one directly once you're joining you will get a message message from me and you have the opportunity to directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below and the big question is what could be the next demand driver for the atth token and maybe that's the new note let's have a look there's not just the E year Checker there's now the eigh year Edge as well and there's almost 150,000 people that have already signed up to get that aier edge and it might make sense to have a look at how quickly this number is growing but the fact that this number is even shown here that should indicate that the team is pretty much aware that a lot of people that buy in know that this is to a degree a player versus player game right this is to a degree a redistribution game I'm not going to say the p word again but you know exactly what I mean I do believe that this project has some potential to go further up at least medium-term there's simply so much money behind this right there can be a lot of promotion that could be done but I wouldn't buy the atth token to hold it over the next four or five years I do believe that at some point it's likely that the toomics will catch up so this is to a degree in my opinion like playing with fire make sure that you have your eyes on a potential exit point at some point if you get in don't just buy the hype have a very clear look at how quickly is the community growing how many new tokens enter the market and then make a judgment call at what point in time the supply will grow faster than the demand if this is your first time feel free to subscribe I will continue to make updates on a year on the Channel as well feel free to also give this a like it will help the channel grow if you've got

up let's have a look at what's driving all of this who's buying here who's selling here let's look at the onchain metrics most people aren't considering now this is not the first video on Simon's Cat on this channel I published one 54 days ago and it outperformed the average video by quite a bit so an average video is here in Gray Simon's Cat is over here in blue and there's a reason for that performance now at the time of publishing of that video the price was at 424 now we are at 437 so initially we went up by almost 90% then we came back down now we are up since publishing of that video by 52% and so that's the idea of this channel right I try to discuss tokens that are just in the process of growing if you want to be early next time feel free to subscribe now let's have a look at what's causing that rise and subsequent fall and now very quick again let's actually check out what happened to those more than 230,000 holders because not all holders are created equal now for the chart on the left we look at the number of wallets that have at least 30 million Simon Cat tokens and at the current price that's worth $1,112 that's what I'd consider retail that still can move the price somewhat among those $232,000 holders only 3,717 wallets actually hold that amount in other words more than 98% of holders have less than $1,000 worth of cat now in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's now at least $111,000 roughly on the right another 10x so that's now $110,000 worth of the token we see two waves of accumulation and it seems like the second wave where the number of retail investors grew by roughly 50% was much more prominent among the small holders compared to the larger Wales right the number of Wales only grew by roughly 10% so that second wave stopped on the 11th of September and interestingly enough the price movements don't really mirror that adoption right we saw all those new wallets but we don't really see how the price is pumping massively and then potentially staying flat right it's rather than profit taking isn't it fascinating how the number of wallets isn't really correlated with the price now let's zoom in a little bit let's have a look at just what happened in the last month the price in aggregate went down by 11% but we did see a pump just recently now here's the number of holders with the same holding thresholds just for the last month so we are basically zooming in from those top charts to just look at the last month and we don't see that much growth of small retail or mediumsized retail or Wales we rather see the tendency of profit taking again the price chart would suggest that there's some kind of clear Trend the first two weeks of this month went down by pretty much 50% but the number of holders didn't really changed that much can we find out what happened with this second pump was it a lot of new investors buying into the token maybe because of some kind of marketing campaign or was this returning traders that maybe bought more here's why onair data is so useful we can get an answer to that question what we've got on the left is the number of returning users in Orange and the number of new users in purple and it seems like on that 21st of October a lot of returning users traded the token again it was not new users wallets that touched cat before also bought over here I personally prefer to see rather the opposite right I want to see a growing investor base the more people come into a token the higher the price can sustainably go currently it seems like the holder growth isn't really that strong it seems like this pump is also not created by new joiners but by the existing Traders and so that would suggest that maybe at some point those existing Traders could be selling again on the right we see pretty much the same data as on the left the only difference is that it's normalized to 100% consider of looking at the number of Traders we just look at the percent of new users versus returning users can we get a hint of what's going on by looking at individual wallets do we see potentially how influencers are manipulating the price let's have a look at the wallets that we are tracking we track more than 400 influencer wallets so we've got two interesting messages over here influencer just poock received catch tokens so that's 1.5 million tokens and James RN received 3 million tokens and then subsequently 17 million tokens that was in the middle of may now receiving is not the same as buying right it could be simply the team sending tokens to influencers to then ask them to promote the token but it could also be moves from centralized exchanges right when influencer buys a token on a centralized exchange and then afterwards sends it for Cold Storage to their wallet usually though it's simply the team especially when a project is in its very early stages the team simply tries to find ways to get the word out and so here's Tyler hill we track his wallets and here are the two wallets that we Track by James win in total we have 433 wallets now and it's always interesting what's going on for example here ky chesse he bought ndx for 0.023 we are discussing the signal over here but I'm not sharing this publicly on YouTube and the price is at alltime highs we are now at 0.247 cents up another 5% in that last hour so this seems to be something interesting liquidity of only 440k I'm going to buy some of this as well so this is what crypto is all about right it's about being early it's about buying together with the smart money it's not about buying when it's already promoted on YouTube it's about buying when nobody else knows yet about a token when still the market cap is very small and so I invite you to join premium as well there is a 7day money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply message me within the first s days and then I find you 100% no questions asked the link is down below it's the bitcoin.com and besides all those trading signals there's also plenty of tutorials one complete course just on wallet tracking how to set up Bots how to find influencer wallets Etc and of course we've also got the usual we've got dedicated Chats on individual altcoins where we can then discuss when to buy and when to sell so to sum it all up with the Simon catch token I believe that price Discovery does not happen 100% organically it seems like currently the holder growth is pretty much flat I'm not really sure if it makes sense to buy this pump because it is mainly caused by the whales it's mainly caused by the people that already own the token it's not new people coming in and you want to have a growing investor base over time for the price to continue Rising if it's your first time here Fe Fe to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps the channel grow see you on the next video or see you in premium

buy this dip let's try to figure out if there's potentially under all of that price action some kind of positive adoption Trend that's hidden in the onchain data now we're currently at roughly 50 cents per gold token it's down 26% this week as already mentioned and since listing on coin market cap we are up 366 per now is this the final turn around or can we see another rally this is not the first video on Goos maximos on this channel I've published various videos on gold before and I want to share some statistics from the back end of the YouTube channel what I'm mainly interested in is attention as in how many people are interested in gold and the more people there are the better this could be for Price growth now the first video had almost 5,000 views then a bit over 3,000 then 4,000 now the Young EST video that just got published recently has 2,500 videos but it appears as if the interest is somewhat constant even the most recent video outperformed the average video on this channel so the average video is in Gray and the last Goos Maximus video that was published roughly a week ago outperformed slightly that's the line here in blue the first time we talked about go on the channel was when the price was still at 25 cents since then we have doubled but of course we had been even higher before temporarily we went up by more than 250% since publishing of the video and so it's all about timing it's all about being early I try to be early on this channel I publish videos on various mem coins regularly over here so if you don't want to miss the next video feel free to subscribe now how much upside is there potentially for go if we now consider buying the dip how high could we potentially go let's compare gold first with other meme coins and the Very straightforward comparison is simply looking at market caps now goat has a market cap of roughly half a billion if we were to 2x from here and get to roughly a dollar per goat then the market cap would be somewhere around a billion it would be close to FY Eno if we were to Triple from here we would beat Bonk if we were to quadruple from here we'd be close to dog with head the largest of the meme coins on the Solana chain so it's pretty reasonable to assume that a 4X from here is pretty much the glass ceiling right we might go higher than the largest token on Solana but it's not that likely now within the meme coin space goat has some upsite but within the pump fun ecosystem go is already the largest token by quite a margin this is the tokens on pump. fun Goos Maximus is at number one the second token is roughly a third smaller the third token is already less than half the size so a lot of the pump fund value is already in goo Maximus and that might also explain why it's having quite a rough time recently now as usual we're going to analyze the onchain data right we want to figure out what's happening behind all the price action we're going to look at what all of those holders are doing so according to Sals scan. we've got almost 50,000 holders but not all of those holders are created equal some of them might only have a few cents of the token and so let's have a look at some minimum holding thresholds on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 2,000 gold tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 worth of the token in the middle we go a 10x in minimum holding threshold so that's not 20,000 tokens or $10,000 worth of the token on the right another 10x so that's now 200,000 tokens we can see how pretty much all of the wallet cohorts are currently selling they're not buying the whales tend to sell even faster than small retail relatively speaking and so let's just compare this with the tokens that are doing slightly better right let's look for example at the Mii token Mii went up in the last 7 days and here the accumulation charts are much more robust so the holding thresholds are comparable but for God we don't see accumulation for MIT we do not necessarily for the Wales but at least small retail continues to buy in and so yes there is a lot of volatility but even over the course of one week we do see the difference in the price development and so maybe there aren't any net buyers for gold but maybe there's still a lot of attention right and even though there isn't a lot of purchases that high attention could still turn into high prices at some point let's have a look at the number of new investors over time so on the left side we have the new and recurring investors per day on the right side we've got the number of transactions per day and this is again Goos maximos and this looks at the last month and we see how initially there was a lot of excitement a lot of new first-time Traders so those are the bars in purple and we can then see how this flipped around around the 18th 20th of October and then starting on the 24th the recurring Traders really took over and since then the retention is rather slowing down it's not that many new holders per day anymore initially we were almost at 10,000 new Traders per day now we are at roughly 10% of that the token transactions per day also tell pretty much the same story declining interest here's the trading volume in US Dollars over time again a very clear wave function and on the right side we've got the trading volume normalized to 100% so this the same data but instead of looking at dollars we look at % and we can see how overtime small retail makes up more and more of the trading volume this is not necessarily great because again we want to have the smart money buying crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the more we play the game the more we trade the more the luck component gets reduced and the more the skill component shines through in other words the big wallets tended to make the right calls in the past and if the big wallets aren't accumulating when there's no attention that's probably not that great we want to follow the smart money we want to buy with the big whales we want to buy with the top Traders we want to buy when things are still early when the token has just launched a few days ago and we can clearly see how the larger wallets are clearly not that interested anymore now all of this is Goos Maximus or go token specific the pump fun ecosystem as a whole is still very very healthy have a look at the number of deploy transactions over time for pump fun this is close to alltime nice this is very elevated and so this might be surprising for some for others it's obvious Solana did turn to a meme coin casino every single trending token if you order byy liquidity is a mem coin but what's not that obvious is that even within that mem coin casino pump fund takes up more and more share the majority of decentralized exchange trading volume on Solana is now pump. fun related now when you're following this channel you're probably somewhat early but there are ways to be even earlier and that's through wallet tracking so have a look at the following we are tracking various good Traders and various influencers in the Premier membership of this Channel and we have noticed how influencer Kyle Chessie bought a lot of gold tokens on the 14th of October and continued accumulating now that happened for 14 cents and that was before my first YouTube video launched right that launch was at 25 cents KY chesse was temporarily up by more than 500% here's his YouTube Channel 133,000 subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets we are tracking in total more than 400 wallets and so just buying random meme coins is probably not enough I think there is way more value in following the people that move the market or that have a good track record that's why I also made a dedicated tutorial video on nothing but tracking wallets how can we find influencer wallets how can we track them and how can we then subsequently analyze the signals that we get from the tracking it's eight videos in total again and part of Premium but there's more than a 100 videos on all kinds of topics on portfolio Management on onchain analytics not just on wallet tracking there's also dedicated Chats on the different altcoins where we then discuss when to buy when to sell and I'm also of course sharing my trades for example I recently opened a short on ethereum every few days there's also a market update this is simply where I share where I currently see the market going so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so to sum it all up I don't think that goat is a great BET right now I don't see the accumulation on chain the price momentum is also rather negative I think most opportunities are still in the smaller tokens those are the ones that really it's all about buying a token just a few days after launch when the upside potential is still there if you want to help this channel grow feel free to give this a like looking very much forward to seeing you in the next video or potentially in premium

which is now at an all-time high above 80k the question is how much longer can this rally and Dogecoin last let's have a look at some onchain metrics let's try to figure out who's actually currently moving the price so what we've got over here is Bitcoin Bitcoin is at new all-time highs it's also of course above the 120 day simple moving average that's the moving average that historically worked the best for Bitcoin when we run the back test number and so we are off to the races I'm in the market with leverage right now I took advantage of this R very very nicely but of course Bitcoin is nothing compared to the Dogecoin rally in the last 7 Days an appreciation of 90% And in the last month an appreciation of almost 160% and the reason why this is so impressive is again the market cap Dogecoin is huge for Dogecoin to double in market cap a lot of millions have to flow into the asset do coin has a market cap of 43 billion right now it outperformed pretty much any other meme coin in the last seven days only Nero was able to catch up but Nero has only a market cap of 1 billion so 14th of Dogecoin now we have to take the onchain analytics that we're going to look at with a grain of salt because most trading volume actually doesn't happen on chain most trading volume happens through the centralized exchanges through the bances and okx Etc of this World those centralized exchanges are black boxes we can't really look into them we don't really know if it's small retail that's currently buying if it's the whales that are buying we don't know here have a look at this here's the trading volume of Dogecoin in the last 24 hours dominated by binance with 15% then follows okx and gate.io and on top of that we've also got levered bets on the price in the form of Perpetual Futures 11 billion worth of Dogecoin moved hands through those contracts on binance alone in the last 24 hours and so what kind of onchain analytics can we actually do Dogecoin is its own chain so if you want to buy Doge outside of the chain and outside of the centralized exchanges we have to buy a ported version now the most liquid ported version is on the binance smart chain and so make sure you buy the right token don't follow for something that's got the same name the token address starts with 0x ba A2 and ends with 4 c43 and so on chain we've got more than 800,000 holders but of course not all of those holders are created equally right some of those wallets might just have a few cents of the token while other wallets might hold Millions so let's look into the data in a bit more detail let's segregate those different wallets by their holding this is something I do regularly on this channel and what we see over here are long-term charts they start in April of 2021 and on the left side we see the number of Wallets on the binance M chain that have at least 3,000 dogecoins at the current price of 28 cents that's roughly $900 or so worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $9,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right another 10x so $90,000 we can see how small retail pretty much stopped accumulating Doge in May of this year we can also see something similar for medium-sized retail we can see how the Wales they tend to even now reduce in numbers when we just look at the last month the number of Wales on chain on the binance smart chain went from 290 to 270 so a reduction of 10% again while the price went up by 158% now among the larger cap cryptocurrencies Dogecoin is probably one of the most volatile ones thus timing the market is very critical and so we do see some interesting data again through the onchan Analytics here is a very useful chart we see the number of buyers and sellers over time so on the left side that's the count and on the right side that's normalized to 100% now what is so interesting here let's have a look at two data points recently where the number of buyers outpaced the number of sellers massively several days in a row so we had more than 80% buyers only 10 to 20% sellers what happened during those two different points in time so let's first look at the 15th of October 2023 that was over here it was just before we saw a nice rally in Dogecoin of 70% now let's have a look at the beginning of February 2024 that's over here again just before we saw a massive rally in Dogecoin of 130% maybe even 180% and so unfortunately we don't see that imbalance right now otherwise it would be a clear buying signal right now it seems like Dogecoin could be somewhat heated and I say this because of two things number one is that the Dogecoin dominance so the fraction of all of crypto that's currently in doge is spiking up quite a bit and in the past we have seen those spikes and subsequent deflation the second problem is that trading volume is pretty high and there is some correlation quite strong correlation actually for Dogecoin between the attention the trading volume and the price and all of those things are high of course we tend to afterwards Trend down and so again let me show you what I mean most people just look at do coin with this chart which is just Dogecoin in US dollars but the problem is that here we've got the influence of all of crypto as well right when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up and of course Dogecoin goes up as well thus I like to look at relative valuations and what we have got over here is the Dogecoin dominance how much of all of crypto is Dogecoin that's currently at 1.55% and we did see very similar Ries in the past and subsequently Dogecoin underperformed the rest of crypto by more than 50 % I'm not saying that history will 100% repeat itself I'm just saying that this is not necessarily that pretty of a chart now secondly we've got the trading volume that's here at the bottom and just have a look at when this spiked we also tended to spike in the price we've seen this in November 2022 we've also seen this in March of 2024 so yes we can see a secondary rally but even those kind of drops this is not insignificant this is 24% down and again we are currently very very high in terms of attention the Trump win for the election and the support by Elon Musk that still plays around with the Doge name of course can generate quite a bit of attention right he calls his new department where he wants to increase efficiency in the government the department of government efficiency in other words do Doge but yeah the question is how long can this attention last I think it's rather risky to buy Doge now among all cryptocurrencies across all chains Dogecoin is already at number six it's got almost half the market cap of Solana that sees billions of trading volume every day I believe most gains are to be made in the small meme coins it's about figuring out meme coins that will gain attention in the future and where it doesn't need that much money to move the price because when we look at the meme coins that outperformed the best in the last 7 Days their market caps aren't that high the best one had less than 100 million in market cap the second best is of course Dogecoin related as well but again if the original Dogecoin goes down then probably this derivative won't do that great either I have a look at this fcoin I made a video on fcoin several weeks ago as well I also purchased it I announced this in the premium membership here and the point is that the real outperformers tend to be in the lower market caps it's not necessarily in the sixth largest of all of the cryptocurrencies doubling some something again that's already 41 billion in market cap is really not that easy and so here's what I personally do I look at different wallets I track wallets I try to figure out what kind of influencer owns what kind of wallet and whenever those kinds of wallets make transactions I look at those transactions and I vet them and I tend to buy with the influencer because what very often happens is that influencer buys a small meme coin for example and then afterwards after they purchase they then announce this on Twitter they then announce this on YouTube and then the price tends to shoot up quite a bit and so have a look at this for example Crypt bter bought the peanut token that was on the 3rd of November for 3 cents peanut is now absolutely Going Bonkers 140% in the last 24 hours it's up now 800% since Crypt Benta bought and so this is the Crypt Benta channel it's got 1.1 million subscribers and we've got 33 of their wallets we track in total more than 400 wallets and so people are making money I just recently sent a welcome video to a new Joiner he's following the different wallet notifications and it's already paying off no surprise here there's an entire course on wallet tracking there are eight videos just on how to find influencer wallets how to track them how to then afterwards interpret the signals there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total also on onchan analytics the things that we looked at in this video also on risk management on portfolio diversification Etc we are also disc ing the individual altcoins when to buy when to sell in dedicated Chets and so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month the link is down below the bitcoin.com there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% And so I think it's already too late for Dogecoin I think the upside potential isn't really there anymore we can't necessarily double and triple from here that easily I think the real chances are now in the smaller altcoins and if you got some value all this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lR01UAvbbg,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'Flow',

October 20th of the fourth year priced 11 zeros 5 now it costs 10 zeros and 2 is why you see pretty good growth and such a short period 2 x this project did and look at this huge community here 50 practically 2,000 holders of this coin of mine like I said earlier here the capitalization of this project is 12,000,000 liquidity 1 and 4,000,000 is pretty good Let s look at safety. as always cyberscope to help us a pretty high score 72% a Market 97 decidalization 84 safety 70 and foodmetal 77 still hope that this will be the future neir putting such a high grade on social networks

fundamental less appreciated Market 88 is pretty good look further you can see in more detail where are the errors in the code if not put 80% audit see they they were fixing where was the audit and now they have searched also great in this regard go further that football is fundamental little appreciation is understandable but why it's unclear where they mostly buy basically buy as you see it eat and America and Asia love this coin go on the site rates pretty decent high here is what else is interesting here is there an analysis uh holders as you can see for now pretty still average but the holders are typed well here it says 47 even though there 51 holders well, fudge that is, here of course aa what else can you see what most probably buy this coin aa on the exchanges Max how i see

Telegram will appreciate normally 8,000 holders well overall score 4 95 is good too go on let's look at the holder at 50,000 as we see here here exchanges exchanges 1 on the mex exchange has 5% so also there is gae tae o and gae tae o 2 see well they have 25% among themselves send among themselves and also on the mex exchange you see there are transactions go further look at aa ekaterinonal graffig here also very good handsome but than it is important that there is an audit here and the audit here on the geo-terminal is much higher than dec screener and and cyberscope uh here is they rate this ma'am coin at 93% in some 3 months right now we will see for 1 month 93% on safety that's a very high score here we go further go to click check click check exactly also rates this contract at 72% tick stands all good and overall rating 26 out of 6 this is very cool and where basically see less Gate exchange oh and max go further code for some reason the code is rated low only 30% and of

definitely standing out the wolf token almost 3x in the last week while the rest of the market didn't do much let's have a look at the onchain metric let's try to find out who's buying here who's selling here is this potentially a meme coin to buy at this time now what we are looking here at is the performance in the last week for the tokens with a market cap in the ranks between 300 and 400 so those are definitely not the largest tokens we are looking at tokens with upside potential and wolf seems to have besides upside potential also positive momentum this is then how that looks on the chart we up 50% today as said we are almost up 3x this week and we're up almost 500% this year of course not without drama we did see our pump and dump in between now I'm not going to walk you through the website because this is not how we can get an edge in the market right we want to look at data most people aren't looking at we want to know things most people don't thus we want to have an approach to time bottoms and tops properly now the main risk with meme coins is manipulation if there's only a few insiders that pump and dump the coin and we don't have really an edge what we want to see is long-term adoption by a lot of people we want to write the current wave because if there's more and more investors buying into mcoin that's potentially positive now let's search for hints of potential manipulation let's compare numbers on the Solana chain we've got 26,000 holders of w on Twitter or the xplatform we've got almost 700,000 followers now this is odd normally we don't see such a discrepancy why would there be almost 30 times as many followers on Twitter than holders on the most active chain now one possible explanation could be usage on chain so maybe we don't see all the holders on Solana maybe the holders are hidden somewhere in Black boxes in the gate iOS Etc of this world and yes this might be part of the reason most trading volume happens on bitet which is a centralized exchange however the decentralized exchanges are still very significant we still see a lot of trading volume on them if we add those two together we are at 38% of trading volume now there are many ways to analyze a token and one very crude way but potentially still valuable is to Simply look at the number of buyers versus Sellers and we don't need any advanced tooling to see what's going on have a look at this over here this is Dex screen.com and we can see the buying volume versus the selling volume in the last 24 hours so the price went up by 48% and we see that the buying volume was 206,000 while the selling volume was only 169,000 so there's a Delta of roughly $37,000 and because there's not a lot of liquidity on chain that Delta in buying versus selling can push up the price that much now what I like to look at is the buying volume relative to the number of buyers buers so what's interesting is that the buying volume is outpacing the selling volume but at the same time the number of buyers is much smaller than the number of sellers so we've got only 40% buyers but 54% of buying volume in other words the buyers that are buying are buying much more in terms of dollars than what the sellers are selling or to describe this in leman's terms it's the whales that buy a lot and it's a few small retail investors that might sell on the way up now let's get a bit more Advanced here is some data from a tool that I've developed myself that's by the way also available to the premium members link is down below you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and look at the exact same numbers what we see on the left is the number of firsttime traders in purple versus the number of recurring traders in Orange for any given day in the last 30 days and we see how this started to Peak on the 24th of October so that's over here when the rally started we see how the numbers are now declining somewhat but please ignore the last data point because because this day is not yet over the same happened for the number of token transactions it started peing on the 24th here's the trading volume by Trader segment so small retail are wallets below $11,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to 10,000 large retail is above 10,000 and so we've seen a lot of trading by small retail from the beginning of May up until the middle of August that's when the price went up quite a lot by 160% roughly we can also see see this in this chart over here right the trading volume was quite elevated and then it stopped and with the trading volume crash came subsequently the price Collapse by 70% and so on the right side we see the same data as on the left just normalized to 100% And so I find this data very fascinating because it seems like up until the middle of August it was a lot of small wallets that bought the token that traded the token and then the price also went up and once that stopped the price collapsed but actually I believe that that trading volume by all of those small wallets was not natural and here's why check out The Following over here this is the number of wallets that have at least 400,000 or 4 million or 40 million worth of the token now 400,000 tokens at the current price is roughly $500 worth of the token so this is $500 this is $55,000 this is $50,000 already since the middle of April those numbers tend to decline so it looks like this is just shuffling around of internal funds this is not natural do you really believe that there is more than 11,000 wallets that have $50,000 worth of the token and the total liquidity on chain is only half a million I don't think so how is it possible that so many small retail wallets traded the token and that that subsequently collapsed when at the same time the number of holders at $500 worth of the token continued to decline I believe some kind of wash trading algorithm was pushing up the price was trying to generate some attention and when that stopped working when the price didn't rise anymore despite that effort that's when they turned off the machines that's when wolfy was not trending anymore and that's then when the manipulators cashed out and so again the rally that we're seeing in the last 24 hours is definitely not natural we don't see the number of holders going up we probably see a lot of Bot accounts that got just generated and that now trade the token against one another that's of course somewhat of a pricey Endeavor right because $400,000 worth of trading volume minus the 0.2 maybe 0.4% decentralized exchange fees that's still several th000 in fees to generate that attention but sometimes a token that relies even because of manipulation can generate enough of that attention to get more people on so that's why sometimes mem coins have this flywheel effect right everything else is r but the wuf token is up now I personally don't like to buy tokens like this I like to buy either tokens that see organic growth by a lot of retail investors That You Don't See just a pump and dump alternatively I like to buy tokens where I see smart other Traders buying or where I see influencers buying and those influencers might afterwards promote the token on their YouTube or on their Twitter so have a look at this this channel has a premium membership the link is down below the bitcoin.com we are tracking various top Traders various whales and you have seen one of those whales buying constantly into the Boe or the book of ethereum token since August of this year we then started discussing this in our various channels right we've got various dedicated altcoin channels and this is how the price subsequently developed right in the last year more than 1,000% return making money in crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more information we have the more we know that other people don't know the better that's how we buy assets smartly and how we avoid the manipulated stuff for example over here we are tracking influencer Alex Becker we've got 12 of its wallets not all of those wallets are well known or we are tracking influencer James win or influencer crypto gains we've got 436 wallets now in total they give us signals regularly and instead of buying what's currently green and be exit liquidity to manipulators we buy things before the influencers promote stuff it's all about timing it's all about finding the right information sources there's even a tutorial just on finding the right wallets in premium actually not just one tutorial there's a whole tutorial course there's eight videos on that topic how to find various influencer wallets how to find related wallets how to track those wallets how to interpret those wallet alerts in total there's more than 100 tutorial videos now there's also a money back guarantee so simply just message me within the first s days if you don't like what you see I'll refund you 100% so I'm personally staying away from from wolfy I don't want to guess how much longer this manipulation can last if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps our Channel grow see you

make money in the market like I took a trade let's take an example let's take an example I took a trade at 0.03 I want to sell somebody has to buy the top trading means what buy and sell I don't want you guys to be exit liquidity no I don't want that so whenever you take a trade we only have two ways to make money in the market it's extremely bullish I read in and out about clv but we have to wait for breakout once price breaks this level breaks this level closing above it 0.15 good to go nobody in the world will resist you to take a trade on clb after breakout after breakout I going to make videos I myself will add into my portfolio after breakout because after breakout it won't be staying it won't be staying fluctuating over here no it won't be it'll be pumping on stop after that if I zoom out the graph what going to happen it going to pump up to $1 in short term for longterm $10 $10 us yes my friend you heard it right $10 it got that much potential CV don't take it for granted oh it's a project which one no my my friend it's matter of time and we need breakout man once price breaks this level from where price dropped 15 cents once we see closing a it man 0.154 take a trade buy technically chart is indicating you're supposed to take a trade it's not me I'm not projecting something no I'm just explaining what's in the chat that's my job it's a big one don't take it for granted it going to be massive massive bro it'll be parabolic it'll be pumping parabolic man with back to back marabo candles in upcoming days a big really is on but if you are buying now bro it'll it'll drop and you will lose everything in the market if it if it don't break if it don't break it'll be back it'll be back to where it started off and that's how you're going to lose everything in the market mark my words if you are buying and if it won't break it'll be back I have talked about over 6,000 videos I have like 6,000 coins I have talked about I have made over 6,000 videos as of now in crypto specifically I I have the experience man have been doing for 10 years now and if I'm saying something I told totally minute man I not sugar coating something no if my job is to like say something Crystal Clear if it's bullish I'll say as simple as that it's a big one we just need breakout if price breaks 0.15 4155 B it'll be massive $1 price prediction put a stop loss 0 13 a stop loss after break out but take a trade I wish you all the best have a nice day cheers guys leave your thoughts in the comments you have regarding clb have a nice day cheers

longterm, Simon Cat Tokenomics,  #cat #memecoin #crypto","crypto is crashing and especially the meme coins are crashing does it make sense to buy this dip does it make sense to buy Simon Cat one of the leading meme coins on the binance smart chain let's have a look at some onchain metrics let's have a look at the data most people aren't considering now what we see over here is the others dominance so this shows how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 and we can see this continuously declining since beginning of the year and here is to a degree the reverse of that chart this is Bitcoin dominance so Bitcoin becomes a more and more important factor of all of crypto now why is this all happening the answer is the Bitcoin ETF have a look at this chart this is the daily inant outflows out of the Bitcoin ETFs and initially we have seen quite a lot of outflows from the grayscale Bitcoin trust now this has changed recently we don't see those outflows anymore thus all the inflows we into those new instruments are 100% net positive this is what's currently supporting the Bitcoin price it's purchases by Wall Street its purchases through the ETF and so let's get back to Simon's Cat which is not doing that well recently it's down 26% this week alone and yes this year we almost doubled but under quite a bit of pain we ried and crashed we ried yet again we crashed yet again is this a potential Bu The Dip opportunity let's try try to find this out by looking directly on chain on the binance smart chain where Simon skat is mainly traded who is currently buying is the number of holders increasing for small retail or for the Wales now here is how important the token actually is among the trending tokens on the binance smart chain and the binance smart chain is the third largest of the chains it's the second largest token with a liquidity of almost 15 million and so the long-term chart looks pretty promising right it looks like there is upside potential of 72% roughly and the comparisons in terms of market cap are also promising it's got a market cap of 174 million and it could potentially double right there's still a lot of other meme coins that are double the size baby Dogecoin is on the binance marchain as well book of meme Goos maximos turbo Etc so according to BSC scan we've almost a quarter of a million holders on chain now not all of those holders purchased the token right there was an airdrop and so then the question is who's actually holding substantial amounts of the token here's a statistic I like to look at pretty much with any video on this channel and that's the number of small investors versus large investors on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 40 million cat tokens at the current price that's worth roughly $11,000 for the chart in the middle we go a 10x so that's roughly $10,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right it's roughly $100,000 worth of the token again minimum holding so among the 243,000 holders less than 1% has more than $11,000 in it and so we can see this is not necessarily growing over time we can also see how this is not necessarily fluctuating that much over time how do we see crashes like this of 50% regularly when the number of holders isn't really fluctuating that much I've got an explanation but before we talk about this I want to share my YouTube analytics on prior Simon Cat videos so there was a video published 66 days ago and it outperformed the average video quite a bit then there was another video published 13 days ago that tends to perform pretty much with the average so maybe there is some kind of decline in attention now attention is correlated with price right it makes sense to buy a token when nobody is looking it makes sense to sell a token when everybody is looking but here's I think what's causing all of that volatility and that's influenced by the centralized exchanges have a look at the Perpetual Futures Market that's dominated by binance but okx and buybit are also part of the party if you don't see the holder graphs fluctuating that much what we see over here is simply just the last month then those massive price crashes can only be explained by the mega Wales selling right by potentially the centralized exchanges and so I'm personally not buying Simon's Cat I prefer tokens that have organic long-term growth on chain as well in the premium membership of this channel we have they tracking more than 400 wallets and I have not seen a single wallet a single influencer or a single top Trader trading cat I've only seen James win receiving some cat but those were cat tokens on ethereum it was not the B&B token so for example we've got 12 of Alex Becker's wallet and he's got 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube or we tracking 33 of Crypt bent's wallets and they've got 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube when we see the those kinds of wallets buying something it might make sense to buy as well right very often influencers buy a token to then afterwards talk about it on YouTube and when then all the YouTube viewers buy the token afterwards the price tends to really rally however when we've got a token that's mainly manipulated by the centralized exchanges that's not traded by any influencers and that doesn't really see any accumulation on chain either then even though the chart might look interesting the only driver for an appreciation would be yet again manipulation and so the more people buy this dip the more the price could potentially crash right this is what the centralized exchangers want to do they want to make money as well and so they position themselves exactly opposite of what most other people are doing and so I rather keep buying the tokens that those large players those large influencers and top Traders are buying there are also dedicated tutorial videos in premium on how to find those wallets and how to track them so there's an entire course in premium eight videos in total on how to find different influencer Wallets on how to track them and on how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total not just about wallet tracking but also about portfolio management risk management bet sizing Etc feel free to check it out of course there are also dedicated chat groups for the individual altcoins feel free to check it out there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so I personally stay away from Simon's Cat I think especially in an environment where bitcoin's dominance is rising we have to be very very picky with what altcoins to buy it's a 100% player versus player game if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vH4K1GePd8,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Dogecoin', 'Turbo', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vH4K1GePd8/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-04T12:27:49Z

https://open.spotify.com/show/7sDXM8BlxsUqzL2IqmLqwE",hello and welcome to the protocol podcast I'm Brad C here with my co-hosts Margot niker and Sam Kessler excited to dive into Today's Show with the latest news and developments in technology behind crypto and block chains first please do not forget to subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter the protocol on coindesk.com let's dive right into it our first story we're talking about ethereum developers create dn44 tokens after ERC 404s send Network fees surging okay that is just a lot of stuff that probably a lot of people have zero idea what any of that is even like regular you know crypto people don't even all this stuff was just invented two weeks ago but anyway um Sam what do you think of why don't you tell us about this story yeah like you said this is this is new um so ERC 404 um is this new token standard developed by this protocol um nft protocol Pandora essentially what it is is it's just like a fungible nft which sounds kind of um like a sort of misnomer um or or an oxymoron rather um what is a fungible non-f fungible token what they do is they combine fungible tokens um just like a regular cryptocurrency with a non-f funable token so that you can for example trade um fractions of NFS have the nft burned in your wallet and then to the person who you've traded the fraction to um if they get enough of this fraction they can mint a new version of the nft in their wallet um that's kind of like a vague way of explaining it but that's at a high level what this concept is and there's like all this controversy around it that our um great colleague Dan um wrote about so um we can get into all that um Margo you follow the ethereum world so maybe you've got some sense of you know what the response has been up until now yeah what you were sort of getting at was that this is not ERC 404 is not an official standard um that it's sort of been like created and marketed with that framing ERC stands for ethereum request for comment usually when you get these standards you go through like a process and it gets approved by the community and by the devs and this is not the case for ERC 404 it's just called ERC 404 it's not an actual uh legitimate standard um and so it's been interesting sort of to see The Fallout in The Wider like ethereum ecosystem as this protocol has sort of surged um you know to the front lines of the new news I guess but at the same time I've like noticed from the devs like they haven't said that much about it um but I don't know what do do you do you guys have any takes on on this whole controversy around ERC 404 I mean in general the idea seems smart and useful of a way of fractionalizing these nfts I mean some of them are you know they can be quite expensive right I mean and and you know I mean an nft can be any anything right I mean nft could be a Super Bowl ticket you know um but uh you know and then you have a Super Bowl ticket that's whatever like you know 120 Grand fractionalize that you know where you're only gonna toss in a thousand bucks but you're basically going to speculate on the you know cost of a Super Bowl ticket but I don't know like that's you know or a piece of Fine Art where you have you know like 5% of it but it seems like there's lots of different ways people have tried to do the this is just kind of the latest is that the way you all think about it maybe one thing um that I didn't do a good job of is kind of like explaining how this works and why it's you know cool I I I I mean essentially just very simply again what happens is rather than just being able to own one nft um which is you know the way things work now um and it has problems uh namely uh most notably with liquidity like if I want to buy an nft only one person has it um you know where am I going to get that N I can buy nfts that are in a collection s but it's just price Discovery all these things are hard what this does is it says Hey an nft can be broken down so if you own a whole nft say it's like a 100 tokens if you own all a hundred of them um you have that nft um if you sell one of those hundred tokens it goes down to 999 you have 99% of the nft that's actually not a a concept so you don't have 99% you have none of the nft what it does is it burns that nft in your wallet um and then if you send those 99 tokens to somebody who has one and they have a hole now they have 100 it mints a new nft for them so it's actually not the same nft before it's a new minted version but in the context of something Brad you give the example of like tickets that actually makes a lot of sense say you don't have a ticket that is worthless but if you're able to scrap together um you know enough pieces of a ticket now you have a whole non-fungible T token you have a ticket that's really cool and also there's like a bunch of trading applications on top of it that could you know just with liquidity in general like people love to speculate this app opens new avenues for speculation so it is like a kind of cool idea but again uh this this whole thing that Margot was talking about around how they didn't go through the formal process to propose this I is why uh part of you probably the entire reason of why we're talking about it today was it false advertising what if this thing's broken people think it's legitimate they start using this and they realize they don't have their tickets um that's that's the problem um it's not as audited as you might hope yeah I I think it's interesting you bring up the trading perspective because you know when I came into into uh this podcast or this recording I have sort of rolled my eyes at this like why is this actually needed um and you know there's so many problems on ethereum like this is what we're dealing with um but you know I guess that that that that does kind of make sense in a um like a narrow scope I wonder though if this is just like another hype cycle like how how persistent is this also because like like you said this is this is not something that's been officially approved we don't know what the security risks are behind this we hasn't been properly audited like people I guess crypto is risky but this is very risky in my opinion and so so you know this it's it's another one of those interesting stories to follow especially the Fallout from this but you know I guess with everything in crypto these days is is this really needed is my sort of my take on all that and the fun Strat newsletter I was just reading that this morning they were they were just saying that what we're actually seeing is just another meme coin sure incarn ation and but I mean I think it is important to point out here Sam I don't know if you I don't remember if you pointed this out but that it it is causing some congestion right like the the frenzy is real enough that it's being se you can witness it in like a a rise in the gas fees right yeah that's the other piece of this story that I did neglect to mention which is that gasv on ethereum are rising to you know record levels at least as far as recent history is concerned all on you know or or largely on account of this new trend um is it a meme is it all hype probably everything has been meeme and hype up until now um basically in crypto and on ethereum defi but broadly there has been this defi Resurgence that we've seen on ethereum which I'm I think we'll get into later as we talk about air drops um but this also might be kind of a part of that the appetite is there again for these sort of like speculative things which for D5 broadly if not this token standard might be viewed as a some something of a positive but I think you're right Margo like what is the use case for this you know in it this particular technological innovation I don't know if it has legs or it's just a step towards something else right but all right well let's move on um to our next topic okay Satoshi era Bitcoin function opcat dusted off as development feror grows so you know this is just more on the ongoing theme of building on bitcoin right I mean people are suddenly excited about the possibility of you know some of the the stuff on bitcoin that we've seen on ethereum and some of the other you know alt ones and layer 2os and some of the other ecosystems and this is actually I mean Jamie Crawley wrote this story and he did a really good job of kind of figuring it out but there's some history here which is this opcat function was actually included I think on the Bitcoin core software or I don't think it was called Bitcoin core software at that point it was just the Bitcoin software uh you know very early days you know the network launched the Bitcoin blockchain launched in 2009 and then 2010 Satoshi took it out because there were certain risks um and uh but now these some developers are saying let's bring it back because technology has apparently reduced some of those risks and this will enable uh the next wave of building on bitcoin um I don't know what do y'all think about this yeah I think it's great that you know that I I feel like we've been coming now almost weekly or maybe bi-weekly been talking about building on bitcoin and so it's great to sort of hear that there's this Resurgence um you know uh with modifying and uh updating the network yeah so this is interesting I mean I wonder though if you can kind of like help me understand having you know knowing very little which is a theme about Bitcoin um uh development um I I I wonder if you can you know explain what this um opcat thing actually is like what does this enable um for the network for developers well I probably shouldn't go at too much technical depth because I will quickly screw it up but what I will say is the the cat refers to the word concatenate and so basically they're putting two elements together and the idea was that would quickly you know get too much and it would not only uh result in exponential memory requirements but it would also expose the network to some sort of security risks an OP code is you have these on all blockchains essentially a blockchain can be thought of like an operating system and an OP code is just like at a very root level you know a a function that you can do on the Chain that's like when I say root level it's like addition subtraction in some cases exponentials multiplication you know some some more crazy things this is like concatenating things together and I I don't yeah I I guess the idea um for them I is that for for developers of Bitcoin relative to other things um other protocols the idea of something like this being a burden to the network might be more precient because Bitcoin has historically like we've alluded to in past episodes and today been much more reticent to expand on its core functionality because they don't want to make that big computer that operating system too heavy for the network to run they want to keep things as simple as possible I wonder um knowing like I said very little about this how much of this um concern around this opcat stuff which is apparently supposed to make things better for l2s Defi and so on on top of Bitcoin I wonder how much of that concern is born out of like a real genuine sense of anxiety around the chain getting bogged down and how much of it is just kind of a a more you know uh I guess fight ORF flight sort of a thing that you get with Bitcoin developers where they're just constitutionally incapable of you know adjusting the core programming um the the core rules of the ch do you have any sense of that for I mean I I I don't know if we would from talking to developers I think it gets at some of the core issues which is you know Bitcoin does not have kind of a leading organization it's it's it really is much more of this like open-source collaborative you know Spirit which means a lot of times things have to have consensus in order to get merged in and so that is kind of one of the perennial debates going on and how do you enable this building on bitcoin do you can you do it without changes to the code so there was a breakthrough Robin Linus's it's called bit VM um you know what the Breakthrough there was they could they could add some of this functionality without having to to get consensus you know um and then separately I was just reading this proposal yesterday um from in fact one of the authors uh is from botanics Labs which happens to be building like an evm compatible um Layer Two uh on bitcoin you know it's like a little proof of stake Network that sits on bitcoin anyway one of the developers works for that company um but they were in their you know proposal they talk about how some things work without those changes to the code you can build a layer two but it's a lot easier if you can get this change I guess you know because it just gives you a little more flexibility I don't know does that answer your question Sam yeah it does just become a question it almost feels like talking about government or something when you talk about Bitcoin ethereum to a lesser extent um to an almost non-existent extent on other changes chains like I'm sure you hear like slippery slope sort of arguments where it's like oh once we add you know this back I mean this should be something easy like it used to be in there and now you know machines are strong enough that we can actually you know nodes and clients are and so on are are strong enough that they can handle this like if you can't get this in um you know maybe that slippery slope is not something that you're going to go down Argo you have any thoughts on this yeah it sounded like this change like yes there are these security risks but it's sort of with the mind it's being brought back in with the mindset of it enables like this additional building like that this building on bitcoin is not stopping that there will be additional um changes maybe to the protocol I wonder specifically like high level like what is it that this change in code can enable in terms of building like what is that goal that they're heading towards I mean they gave some examples um layer 2os should be a little easier they talked about uh decentralized exchanges so I guess some of the defi stuffff mhm um there were a couple other examples in Jamie's story no I mean that's that's great it sounds like it's you know like we've talked about like MIM mimicking ethereum a little bit but you know we we we love to see it you know the ethereum foundation you know they take a long time to get these things through but more or less like if they say they want it it seems like it probably gets onto the road map whereas I kind of disagree with with the with the I mean the ethereum foundation is like holds it's definitely a Central Key component of the ethereum ecosystem um and you know a lot of the core devs are employed by the ethereum foundation um but I wouldn't say that the ethereum foundation is involved in um you know the road map and the direction or at least that's what they would say um and you people can debate it a little bit but it's not like a um key well key is the wrong word it's not a sitting like member of making these changes you know as an institution um but that is the difference between Bitcoin and ethereum is that you know ethereum the ethereum foundation is so uh vast in its um in what it touches in the ethereum ecos system whether it be grants whether it be you know employing cevs whether whether it be helping create these clients that we've talked about right um and Bitcoin doesn't have that anyway back to bitcoin that's that's in it's still still great to see that you know it's giving room for more of this growth yeah yeah I think it's all Spectrum too regarding what you're saying Margo like yeah you a lot like the history of this goes back to not a tech conversation um but a conversation around regulatory things and icos and so on and the reason why these foundations might want to distinguish themselves from core development I do think you're right though that in the case of ethereum at least if not relative to bitcoin relative to a lot of other ecosystems you do just by virtue of its like largess it's much larger than um other um you know comparable ecosystems they're able to have more people pitching in they're able to have you know more people with dueling incentives pitching in on the development of the of the chain Wares with Bitcoin when they're not actually doing that much that decentralization you know um means um a little bit more at least in the case of ethereum you see more people you know even centralized parties weighing in because you know they're actually making changes in a way that Bitcoin until recently you know doesn't yeah well all right let's uh let's let's wrap that one there uh let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about well variety of things airdrop season and also how it relates to what we're seeing on enan layer um it's going to be fun and complicated all right we'll be right back calling all developers score a consensus 2024 developer pass for just $19

welcome back we have our next topic actually I sort of teased it right before the break so Marg why don't you just kind of tell us what's the big idea that we're going to be talking about yeah airdrop season free money basically but um you know um Stark net is among the ones that are leading the airdrop season um with its big announcement that they much anticipated start token is going to become eligible to a variety of users in the in the Stark net ecosystem ethereum ecosystem and in the non web3 ecos like I guess I don't know if there's an ecosystem for that but basically non web3 users um are also going to be eligible so you know they they announced um I guess we're recording on a Wednesday they announced today uh that you know they're making 1.3 million wallets uh available for this token and it'll be aird dropped on the on the 20th and they and users have until June 20th to claim it so exciting stuff for for the you know much anticipated Stark token Margo let me ask you Stark net you know what is Stark net and why do they you know Stark's been operating right but why do they need a token now yeah so Stark's a layer two uh built on ethereum there is ZK you use you know ZK r at they use zero knowledge um but they have their own programming language called Cairo so it's not necessarily uh ZK evm um and so that because of that sort of barrier there's been a little bit more of a distance between um stet and other uh ZK rollups that are ZK evm like polygon like scroll scroll is new but but matter Labs I'm thinking of ZK sync um and so there's uh there hasn't been a Tok there hasn't been a token yet on Stark it has his own ecosystem there's a whole bunch of daps and uh you know exchanges and and just like a gaming I think is also pretty big on Stark net um and so now there's the Stark token that um the team the St well the announcement came from the starkware found Stark net foundation and the primary developer fir behind Stark net is the company called starkware um and so they've come out with this token that they say they're that is primarily going to be used for governance purposes and to participate in this Stark net ecosystem um but I thought it's really interesting because I I I I have I do speak a lot to the Stark net folks um and they're very uh much ethereum aligned is what they call it meaning they are pursuing their interests in the sake of for the sake of ethereum's interest um and so they've made this uh Stark net airdrop pretty big um to allow people like home like solo stakers um including people who uh you know stake with Lio and other liquid staking providers as well as um as develop veler or core developers from ethereum people who've you know been crucial to implementing some of the biggest code changes to make ethereum what it is today um as well as also these non web3 developers who develop in the sake of you know for the sake of Open Source um I so I think it's really interesting because this this airdrop is sort of getting at um not necessarily always what everyone is excited about about you know free money but also that it sort of has this like vision and this Mission and sort of to like give back to the core of uh their ecosystem which is ethereum it'll be interesting to see who claims their tokens and and uh whether you know ethereum developers I mean I think the reaction on Twitter so far has X I should say has been positive I've seen a lot of core eth like people um excited to see that you know they're being rewarded for their hard hard work in some sense um but yeah that's sort of what the takeaway from from this specific air drop has been yeah maybe to place this into a broader context too it's interesting to see like ethereum defi having a a big I say defi because we're talking about tokens I don't know starkware has defi on it but it's a layer to but anyway ethereum defi is kind of having this big airdrop moment it follows like um you know a similar moment on the salana blockchain that we talked about a while ago where a bunch of these protocols that people have used haven't used some haven't even heard of um are are rewarding people a ton of money um essentially what it equates to through these aird drops but you know um I'm I'm always a little bit um maybe to step back um and uh you know give the the more cynical take on on airdrop season what it's all about I mean there's a bunch of reasons why projects and I'm not talking about starware specifically there's a lot of projects that are launching tokens and a lot of different projects have different motivations and um tokenomics and and and so on and so forth but broadly an airdrop giving this quote unquote free money to people what it what often happens is you have these teams that have spent a bunch of time and resources building something now what they're doing is they're creating a Marketplace for their token ostensibly as a way to reward people also though um to create a new market for this token and to lure in new users but also as a way to reward um you know right rightly um you know their own contributions um so it'll go to investors it'll go to their own team members and so on and so forth and all of these different tokens are going to have very different distributions I mean this is basic stuff for anybody who's been following this ecosystem for a while the crypto ecosystem broadly but it always does bare mentioning when we're talking about airdrops like they're not all created equally you want to be really careful that you're not like dumped on and so on and so forth but one other thing that I'll say here is that we have seen the rise of this trend and we might talk about it in the future um points so the idea of a bunch of protocols that are kind of incenting users to come and join them um to deposit their money um so on and so forth for the prospect not of um necessarily interest but points um which are this kind of like Loosely defined metric that will be used to allocate future airdrops you're seeing this in the liquid restak landscape which we've talked about and we'll talk about more later but people are acre points that don't have any value so that they can later maybe get an airdrop that hasn't been you know confirmed yet for regulatory legal like lawyer reasons um it's all pretty interesting but it is incredibly speculative so this airdrop season you know has a lot of facet the Stark Wares the points the so on and so forth but that's also why we were going to make the connection to enan layer right is that people are piling into Igan layer because they might get the air drops from all these things that igen layer is gonna secure right yeah I mean that's like a tangible but also like you know you can be cynical about this but you can also be like realistic about this as like a mechanism to get people in where ien layer the reaking thing on ethereum where you can stake with them and then they'll help secure other networks and reward you extra interest the whole idea with igen lir which has attracted like6 billion dollar in deposits in just a few months since it started opening and closing deposits um it's attracted all this money like 1.5% of all ethereum according to defi llama all ether rather according to defi llama um the reason it's able to do this is because a bunch of platforms that have been built on top of it that are rewarding points on top of native igen layer points to people who deposit into igen layer through them but the whole point of Igan layer ultimately is going to be that it rewards interest people on top of their deposits but today those interests again are points because that extra interest that you know comes from core protocols and stuff without getting into the technology of it which we'll do on a later episode I'm sure and did on a previous episode it doesn't exist yet so the native like the it's all speculative um and so with airdrop season it's exciting but it's also kind of a signal that we're leading you know we're moving into these economies that are you know a little bit more precarious in their fundamental um you know structure starnet also Wormhole uh they announced their's their air drop is coming you know that'll be another big one but same kind of question like Wormhole has been operating why do they need a a token now and I I don't know I was just kind of thinking about this like part of it is because that's what they're supposed to do right like if that's a reasonable answer like they're kind you know the the criticism is these things are all centralized in some way you want to turn it over to the community that is kind of whether that is true that's sort of you know the Fig Leaf at least but but then you know there's all these people you know to your point Margot they want to get paid you know get paid that's yeah no and they're competing against you know I mean the money printer aspect of these things like the all these projects they have they print their own token it's like they have a money printer so why not use that every other competitors are using it so they might as well they kind of have to most of these tokens it should be noted also like we're talking about this on a podcast we all have American accents because we live here um we're not going to be able to claim these things I mean we're also journalists we're not claiming these things anyway probably um none of us um but you know like it's not available in the United States for a reason there's regulatory reasons in addition to these kind of like high flying like philosophical reasons why one might want to transition to Dow governance and it gets to the Hoy test it gets into all these other things but you know you're appealing to the community by transitioning to Dow governments but you're also looking at the government and saying hey we're not issuing a security we're actually transferring governance and we're releasing tokens that give you votes in this system it it's it it's you know it's about a lot more than rewarding the community um and you can be cynical or not about it but it's like good to be realistic and um yeah our job is journalist is going to be to figure out you know what the real Dows from the you know loosely you know creating markets that you can dump into again not talking about any specific projects here but anyway Margo any final thoughts here before we wrap yeah Sam nailed it I was going to bring up that you know we're US Citizens We're recording recording in the United States so US citizens you can't participate in the star care drop also if you happen to be on the ofac list which I hope you're not but you know if you are you're also not part of that list so uh you know Russia Iran China and the US and whoever else North Koreans here protocol podcast we accept all viewers let's just put it that way sure sure but your start all right uh thank you Margo and that is a wrap for this week thank you for listening to the

&quot;BTC &amp; PEPE 4H Analysis: Crypto Giant and Meme Token Market Structure&quot;,"""Welcome to our essential 4-hour timeframe analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) and PEPE, offering crucial insights into both the broader crypto market leader and the viral meme token phenomenon. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart is currently displaying significant technical developments, with price action testing critical support levels that could determine the next directional move. The recent volume profile suggests accumulation patterns at key technical zones, while momentum indicators are showing potential divergence signals that traders should closely monitor. Moving to PEPE, the 4-hour structure reveals fascinating price behavior, with the meme token showing interesting correlation patterns with Bitcoin's movements. PEPE's recent volatility has created multiple technical setups worth watching, particularly around key Fibonacci levels that have been acting as both support and resistance. The volume analysis on PEPE's 4H timeframe indicates retail interest cycles that often precede significant price movements. We're seeing distinct patterns forming on both assets that could signal upcoming opportunities, with Bitcoin's market dominance directly influencing PEPE's potential moves. This dual analysis provides a comprehensive view of both mainstream and meme token markets, essential for traders operating in these volatile sectors. Understanding the interplay between BTC and PEPE is crucial, as major Bitcoin moves typically cascade through the meme token market, creating both risks and opportunities that savvy traders can capitalize on.""  #Bitcoin #PEPE #4HAnalysis #CryptoTrading #BTCAnalysis #MemeTokens #TechnicalAnalysis #CryptoMarkets #PEPEcoin #MarketStructure  Connect with Us! ==============  YouTube: ‚û°    / @innerracers   Facebook: ‚û°   / innerracers   TikTok: ‚û°   / innerracers   Telegram: ‚û° https://t.me/innerracers Website: ‚û° ebirth.net Contact Us: ‚û° 0357286586 / 0357287387 / 0114492444 WhatsApp ‚û° https://wa.me/94114492444  Subscribe and Join Our Community: =============================  YouTube Channel ‚û° @InnerRacers Join our Telegram ‚û° https://t.me/innerracers",Transcript not available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18CdtkkRYA0,['Pepe'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/18CdtkkRYA0/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-18T04:34:22Z

#magahat #crypto","make America great again the head meme coin is going up quite a bit today but also this whole week while the overall crypto Market isn't doing that great let's have a look at who's buying here who's selling here who's actually driving this R can this potentially last longer to answer that question we will of course as usual look at onchain metrics we will look at the number of whale wallets we will look at the number of retail wallets we will compare who's actually buying who's actually selling currently we are at 0.4 the price went up by 35% today it almost doubled this week but times haven't always been great we had a massive pump with the Peak at the end of May then a subsequent dump now we are recovering who's buying here this is not the first video on the mega Trump token I published one one month ago already at that time there was a lot of attention the number of views outperformed a regular video a follow-up video though underperformed very interesting as in attention seems to be slowing down let's first have a look at the mega Wales there's more than 18,000 holders in general of this token at least that's on chain 18,83 holders but more than 21% is been held by gate iio another 2.4% by Hui another 1.8% by Maxi Etc the large centralized exchanges tend to hold a lot of the token now the question is are they continuing to accumulate or are they potentially selling off an initial distribution they got here is the holding overtime of that gate IO wallet it's continuing to go up this is good here's the wallet by huabi which unfortunately did decline quite a bit by roughly 1/3 in the last week here is Mexi a very similar development also a similar degree of Decline and here we've got another centralized exchange also seeing rather accumulation Now by far the most important chart is really the gate io1 because it has almost 10 times of the holding of wallet number two and again we don't see any distribution here we see continued accumulation but when this is going up why did the price rather decline in the last month let's have a look at more aggregate statistics let's have a look at the number of retail investors versus whale investors is retail accumulating are the whales accumulating let's dive in to answer the question I have built a tool myself that's available to the premium members by the way you can plug in any token into this tool and you can see how many retail mediumsized retail and whale investors there are those are the long-term charts starting in middle of May so on the left side we've got a minimum holding of 2 million tokens at the current price that's equal to $773 that's what I'd consider small retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's a minimum holding of $77,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $70,000 at the current prices and so in the last month the price tended to rather Decline and here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month and here we see why that is it's the number of Wales the number of wallets that hold at least $70,000 worth of the mega hat token that's what went down by roughly 25% the importance of the Wales on the right is more than 100 times as high compared to the Wallets on the left so even though the number of retail investors grew by 10% it's really the whale wallets that pushed the price down and we can see how a lot of that selling stopped in the last week right again this is an entire month a lot of selling of those whales stopped in the last week medium-sized retail bought small retail bought as well the major exchange didn't distribute and that's why we're seeing some kind of reversal here so this looks like a relatively stable consolidation right it doesn't look like the Wales are now selling but in the end the price of this token is 100% in the hands of gate.io simply because there's so much holding on that exchange and this is definitely not just all customer funds this is a lot of Market making Capital as well and so of course we do see most of trading volume happening on gate.io so the onchain Matrix for Mega head look relatively good unfortunately the overall Market doesn't what we see over here behind me is the stable coin market cap of D of usdt of usdc B USD there's all kinds of stable coins in here and unfortunately we haven't seen any fiat currency flowing into crypto for more than two months now crypto isn't expanding anymore and so this is now becoming 100% a player versus player game and because of that I prefer in this market environment to rather short altcoins to rather bet on falling prices of altcoins most altcoins are very likely going to underperform going forward and so I don't necessarily want to pick the needle in the hay stack that might outperform I rather simply try to bet on the Hy stack itself so to put the odds in our favor we can simply just short a basket of various alt coins where there's no attention where the attention rather tends to bleed so for example I shot this altcoin over here I bet on this chart continuing to go down it already went down by roughly 50% this year and I make money as it continues to trickle down the reason why this goes down by the way is because the supply is expanding over time right to economics are hyper hyper important as there's more Supply hitting the market the price tends to go down if demand doesn't grow in the same manner and so in ambiguous markets like this I think it's better not to go too much risk on even though meah head in general looks fine I think shorting altcoins that tend to underperform over the long term are a safer bet and so there are tutorials on how to make money with falling prices I also share what kind of all altcoins I show for example the one I just showed that's all available Down Below in the premium membership it's the bitcoin.com if you've got a crypto portfolio that's above $5,000 or so then it's worth it for you if

on is this Market manipulation who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the onchain data most people are not considering so this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at almost $70 per token but when we zoom out a little bit we can see that there were multiple pumps and dumps in the Tor price the recent 50% rally can barely be seen on that chart simply because the pump before was so massive now this is the long-term price chart but have a look at the long-term market cap chart those charts are slightly different Can you spot the difference in the price chart from this peak to this peak we less than doubled in the market cap chart though we almost tripled why is that the reason is token inflation there had been more and more trb tokens floating around the increasing Supply then depresses the price despite a lot of capital getting locked up in in trb and so this is then how that looks like over time this is the circulating Supply and at the beginning that Supply expansion was really a problem from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 the supply pretty much 5x since then the growth is rather small so it used to be a problem isn't a problem anymore that's very important to know because for most altcoins especially recently launched altcoins we have always the problem of token inflation and time is not necessarily on our side with tellor we don't have that problem so if the overall altcoin Market is going up I don't expect a circulating Supply expansion to depress the tellor price now this is not the first video on trb I made one half a year ago relatively successful so the gray area is a typical video the blue line was that first trb video this guy here by the way is one of the founders of DWF Labs that manipulate the price at the time so that's the cause for this pump and dump more videos followed more interest in Tor follow as well just look at this Delta here another video so obviously you guys like my analysis on Tor feel free to check out the prior videos and feel free to follow this channel because I publish videos regularly and try to be early now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just going through the website in selling you the marketing Jazz I'm interested in the data most people are not considering and so we want to find out what's causing this rally and how much longer this can last unfortunately the Twitter doesn't have a lot of news so this is not a place with any useful information unfortunately the GitHub repository might be a bit more useful so this is a place where programmers submit their code changes we can see how much product development there is and yes there are changes four repositories got changed in the last 24 hours another one here yesterday a lot of activity in the layer repository let's have a look at that here's the number of code changes each day so one and a half months ago there was quite a bit of activity still a bit now but I had a look at the recent updates and that was mainly just unit testing as in making the platform a bit more stable not necessarily new product development so let's have a look at the onchain metrics because we want to know who's buying and who's selling here right when the price is going up then there's obviously more buyers than sellers or at least there's more Capital flowing in than flowing out let's have a look at what retail is doing versus what the whales are doing so there are currently 8,554 holders of the ethereum based teot token and here is the development of the number of wallets over time based on a minimum holding threshold so on the left side we've got the wallets the number of wallets that hold at least 15 trb tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 that's what I'd consider small retail for the middle chart we go a 10x for that minimum holding threshold so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right chart we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token very similar holder Dynamics not a lot of buying nor selling there are our ups and downs but overall the number of investors on chain at least is not increasing over time now why do I say on chain I say on chain because a lot of the trading volume of trb actually does not happen transparently on the blockchain initially DWF laabs a market maker held a lot of trb tokens then over time binance took over those tokens bought the tokens from DWF and so now we see most of trading volume happening on binance and also on okx let's have a look so here's the hold up pie chart of TR B here we've got binance here we've got okx another binance wallet here's the balance development of the first binance wallet sometimes nothing in there sometimes a lot that's probably when the manipulation goes up then again nothing then again a lot feel free to check those charts out right feel free to correlate this with the price charts here's the second binance wallet also very similar we go up and down very erratically and here's the okx wallet okx tends to be accumulating but also again with a lot of vol ility especially since beginning of the year okx is stepping up the game so they started buying heavily over here quite ironic isn't it but that's the problem with trb it's in the hands of the very heavy weights it's not organic demand that's driving up prices check out this chart behind me this is the spot market trading volume per exchange binance is of course dominating afterwards comes okx no surprise here they hold most of the tokens we've also got a bit of coinbase Etc but still this is a battle between binance and okx here is the Perpetual Futures Market a ton of Leverage through binance also a bit through okx and buy it interestingly enough as well even though they don't have that much spot so what's happening here is that on the one hand the exchanges hold a lot of the token they can influence the price up and down but on the other hand they also offer bets on the price right through the derivatives through the peral Futures so you can bet on the outcome of the game you can bet on whether or not the price goes up or down with leverage but at the same time the house can liquidate you if they simply want to because again the trading volume on binance alone on the Perpetual Futures was 2.4 billion 24 hours 2.4 billion the market cap is only 180 million so every trb token moved more than 10 times in the last 24 hours that's how much manipulation there is these pump and dumps can go on for a very long time we've seen it in the past we've seen tib go up all the way to $250 if you consider betting on this R which I personally don't but if you consider betting on this R then make sure to protect yourself against the downside risk make sure to have a trailing stop loss at least as the price Rises you want to adjust your stop loss and once the price turns around you want to exit very very quickly because then potentially the price can crash forcing all kinds of people that are with levered bets in there to sell their Tor for cheap if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly also on tellor feel free to also give this a like

"Dream Machine Token (DMT) Price Prediction from 30$ to 1000$ 2024,2025","Dream Machine Token Price Prediction: From $30 to $1,000? (2024‚Äì2025)  Welcome to our channel! Today, we‚Äôre diving into a fascinating topic that has the crypto world buzzing‚ÄîDream Machine Token. With its current price around $30, there's speculation it could soar to an astonishing $1,000 by 2025. Let‚Äôs break down the key factors influencing this potential growth, the roadmap ahead, and whether this is a realistic target.  What is Dream Machine Token (DMT)? Before we predict its price, let's understand what Dream Machine Token is all about. DMT is not just another cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs part of a larger ecosystem focusing on cutting-edge blockchain technology aimed at solving real-world problems. Its innovative use cases‚Äîsuch as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and utility within the metaverse‚Äîset it apart from typical tokens.  Key selling points include: Strong utility: Supporting DeFi platforms, staking, and governance. Community-driven projects: Backed by an active and loyal community. Technological innovation: Focused on scalability, security, and speed. Current Price and Market Dynamics As of now, the Dream Machine Token sits at $30. While this might seem modest compared to other booming cryptos, it‚Äôs important to note that DMT has been steadily climbing since its launch. Market analysts see this as a sign of sustainable growth rather than short-term hype.  Factors driving the current price: Increased adoption: More platforms are integrating DMT into their ecosystems. Scarcity: Limited token supply creates upward pressure on price. Investor interest: Early adopters see it as a high-potential project. Why a $1,000 Target by 2025? Let‚Äôs explore why some experts are confident DMT can reach $1,000 within the next two years. This ambitious prediction is based on several factors:  1. Expanding Ecosystem The Dream Machine team has an aggressive roadmap for 2024 and 2025. Key milestones include partnerships with major blockchain platforms, the launch of proprietary DeFi solutions, and NFT marketplaces. These developments could significantly boost demand for the token.  2. Deflationary Mechanism DMT‚Äôs tokenomics include a deflationary model. Regular token burns reduce the circulating supply, which could lead to a price surge as demand grows.  3. Bullish Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market is expected to recover and grow substantially in 2024 and 2025, fueled by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. DMT, as an innovative token, is well-positioned to ride this wave.  4. Community and Utility A strong and engaged community drives long-term growth. With increasing utility across DeFi, gaming, and the metaverse, DMT‚Äôs relevance in the crypto space is expected to grow exponentially.  2024 Price Prediction: $100‚Äì$300 In 2024, Dream Machine Token could see steady growth due to:  Key developments in its ecosystem. Increased market adoption. Bullish momentum in the crypto market. While a jump to $300 would be optimistic, $100‚Äì$200 seems achievable given the current trajectory.  2025 Price Prediction: $500‚Äì$1,000 By 2025, if all goes according to plan, DMT could hit the $1,000 mark. Here‚Äôs why:  Mature ecosystem: By this time, Dream Machine‚Äôs ecosystem will be well-established. Institutional investment: With institutional players entering the market, tokens with strong fundamentals like DMT could benefit significantly. Wider adoption: Its integration into gaming, NFTs, and other applications could drive exponential growth. Challenges and Risks While the potential is exciting, it's important to acknowledge the risks:  Market volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously unpredictable. Regulatory hurdles: Unfavorable regulations could hinder growth. Competition: Rival projects could overshadow DMT if it doesn‚Äôt deliver on its promises. Conclusion: Dream Machine Token‚Äôs Future Dream Machine Token has all the ingredients for massive growth‚Äîstrong fundamentals, a dedicated team, and a clear vision. While $1,000 by 2025 is ambitious, it‚Äôs not entirely out of reach if the project continues to execute its roadmap effectively.  Remember, investing in cryptocurrency is inherently risky, and predictions are not guarantees. Always do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing.","[Music] ready for a crazy crypto success story let's talk about DMT crypto it all started with a humble 30 investment back then DMT crypto was just another coin in a sea of digital currencies fast forward to today and that same coin is worth a staggering 1,000 but uh that's right a jaw-dropping skyrocketing rise in value so what's behind this meteoric growth well it's a mix of innovative Tech a passionate community and some Savvy Market moves DM crypto isn't just a token it's a movement people saw its potential got involved and watched their Investments sore it's the kind of crypto Journey that turns heads and fills wallets and who knows with DM's trajectory the sky might just be the limit so next time you're looking at your crypto portfolio remember the name DMT crypto because in the world of digital currency dreams really can come true",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWN04JJbHzQ,['JUST'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWN04JJbHzQ/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-22T09:46:21Z

of 2025 Bitcoin and altcoins have experienced a sharp dip in the last few days this is the time in my opinion you should be dcing into Super Trend cryptocurrencies that could make you a millionaire AI altcoins have been very strong this is going to go into the early trillions by the end of the bull market so which AI altcoins will make you huge Bank my name's the Superman your superhero of 100 to 1,000x gems back in March I spoke to you about a coin called tits which was 233k market cap and only in the last few days has it gone up to near 500 million over 2,000x no YouTuber will find you multiples of that size so if you love content like this make sure you smash a like on this video and make sure that you subscribe so you never miss out there are a lot of you that are watching the videos but not subscribing and subscribing is how you make the real money Bitcoin large caps and the rest of the market have been experiencing a large dip because of overheating in the market 88 out of 100 this is as Bitcoin approached that magic 100K value back in the last week of November in 2020 the exact point where we are at now in theet Market cycle Bitcoin went from near $20,000 down to $117,000 11% but what happened after we went into an incredible up only phase where we are at right now we have had a dip of only 6% now that could mean that we have got more to fall but in my personal opinion this is the time to truly take positions before the violent up only cycle begins why I've been able to make such massive multipliers is because of my investment strategy I like to invest in cryptocurrencies that fall slap bang in the middle of the Pay Dirt formula I look for four specific qualities in a cryptocurrency first of all I look for super Trend narratives these include gaming rwa but more importantly Ai and memes which I think are going to be the real super trends of this cycle they are easy to understand easy to explain and furthermore easy to use this is why Ai and me coins are very very strong cryptocurrencies because they tell a great story a super Trend the next thing I look for is a real Deen market cap the starting market cap has to be low for me to invest cryptocurrency is here for one thing to make you rich a lot of the YouTubers will give you 5 10x shouts but me I look for the ones that are very low market caps the one where you throw a load of darts at a dart board but you hit Bull's eyes the more you you throw them I was able to turn $600 into 1.25 million thanks to one altcoin so D gen market caps ideally in the low Millions is my starting point when investing in a new asset new and unpumped in the last bull market all of the ones that were new were the ones that made the massive multipliers and ideally unpumped cuz people like Virgin Territory where they can be the first to make the money and then the last thing is tell a good story I like to invest in AI daps that look like the things I've seen on TV and in movies about the future and how the future looks in terms of automation AI humanoid and this story is what captures other people to invest so if there's a cryptocurrency that falls right slap bang in the middle of all of these that is where you hit Pay Dirt that is where you can hit the millions of dollars these are the four main types of AI altcoin the larg market caps are the infrastructures but where I see the money making potential is in generative AI which is where you use adap to create something that you want an AI agents task orientated autopilot Bots that do exactly what you want to do and they do it better every single time these are the two areas I think tell the best story and showcase the future of what AI can do as usual nothing I say is to be construed as Financial advice crypto is largely unregulated and highrisk and people who invest should be prepared to lose all their money and everything I see to you in this video is for informational and educational purposes only the first undiscovered AI altcoin I've got for you is deep fake AI deep fake AI is a completely unique AI project in crypto currency no other project that allows you to create deep fake videos so this has a monopoly it's a first mover therefore any interest in AI based deep fake technology will go 100% into this and that's why I believe that this could explode from its present market cap of 7.4 million this is a minuscule market cap compared to the likes of render artificial super intelligence which are in the billions this one to get to a billion which I think is very achievable would make it a 100x from here so with deep fake AI they have got two key features that you can use create deep fake viral videos the first thing is the web app this is an area where the team have already pre-up loaded videos of celebrities and their audio files so that you get a truly authentic and realistic experience I created a video using deep fake AI of Alex Becka and people in the comments thought it was actually him so what you can do is you can create entire videos with these celebrities and they're downloadable and sharable on social media there was a video of Janet Yellen that was made with deep fake AI that got 40 million views because somebody made a funny video using this deep fake technology people are trying to get me to shill shitcoins with this trash what is it deep fake AI app. fake A.O to me I think it's absolutely incredible so you can firstly make it say anything you want so you can do a funny skit or make it promotee something that you have created or you can ask the celebrity a question and then their answer again is a downloadable video now I saw deep fake technology in a Netflix film called Tim where the founder of the AI company actually has a deep faked video where he welcomes everybody coming into the building this technology I think is a game changer it's very very disruptive but the second feature is what I believe is the money maker and that is creating your own deep fake character what you do is you give it a name and then you upload video and audio and then you have got a readymade made deep fake version of whoever you want to create so whereas the web app has basically prescribe people so people that the team have identified can be used but create you can make your own you can make one of you one of an employer one of a family member or you can make one of a minor celebrity or a celebrity that isn't featured feed in the web app so you can create your own all you have to do is download the videos from the internet you can download it from YouTube and then you upload it and then you've got your readymade character and I think this is just superb I personally could upload a few of my videos to the Creator character functionality and then I can pretty much make AI deep fake videos of me without actually having to film my own videos for technology this unique in cryptocurrency I think this market cap is ridiculously low and I think this one is going to have a second win it previously went to a $41 million market cap and it lost 52 x its value therefore this is pretty much bottomed for the next phase and with AI being such a massive super Trend I could see this doing a 100x if not beyond that the second undiscovered gem I have got for you is Mirai miray is a generative AI project they allow you to create gaming worlds and gaming characters with text prompts so you can create 3D assets and the worlds for games now another project that did the exact same thing is neural AI which today sits at 80 million and only in the last week did this get up to a100 million market cap so if meai was to get to where neural AI is that would be a 30X just on neural ai's current price and I think that neural AI is still going to do another 10x so this has got potentially 270x ahead of it so miray incorporates two of my favorite types of AI technology firstly the generative side of it so you are able to create virtual environments and virtual characters but not only that you are able to have a I agents to enhance user interaction you not only have the ability to create characters and the worlds so you could create Call of Duty you could create the map you could create the characters that then shoot each other on the map but also with the AI agents you actually give intellectual life artificial intelligence to the computer controlled characters in a game so what you've got here is an entire game creation solution with AI so why Mirai particularly appeals to me is because they have got the Gen AI functionality they incorporate it with AI agents which like generative AI is a very bullish AI narrative and to make this even more appealing this is also a gaming play so this is AI and gaming so it touches on two super Trends miror is one of the few that actually gives you these three three bullish elements in one project and yet it is 2.61 million market cap and 2.94 million fully diluted value so there is going to be no dilution like a meme coin there is not going to be any inflation that's going to bring the value down there's no Wales to rip the liquidity away because they got cheap coins this to me is an extremely pumpable cryptocurrency and the thing is is that is very very new this only came out in around about August that means it never even experienced a bll market the bull Trend earlier this year ended at the end of March so this came out four months into bearishness so this has never had an opportunity to be able to pump and that's why this is new unpumped and extremely low market cap neural AI is one of my best multipliers for AI projects this year and the starting market cap was 2.5 million before it did a 40x and this market cap is virtually identical and the team is very active as well constantly tweeting and updating the technology so as far as I'm concerned this is a really high quality AI project at a ridiculously low market cap this one reasonably believe could 100x if not more the next hidden AI gem I have got for you is Sensei Sensei is a unique project in Ai and in cryptocurrency only a 6.2 million market cap Sensei is taking a Black Mirror episode and turning it into reality allowing for you to exist Beyond Death Sensei allows you to create a digital autonomous replica of yourself so you can be communicated with after death and who who knows where this technology could potentially go I know he's dead but I can sign you up to something that helps click the link and you talk to it it mimics him and reads through all the things they've ever said online the more it has the more it's him so with Sensei you create a second self you almost can create an entire team so where Sensei is useful is for people with dementia you can create replicas to preserve memories custom replicas for Unique needs education where you can share knowledge globally 24/7 in any language so let's say for instance my udemy courses these can be uploaded to Sensei and shared in multiple languages and then fan engagement any celebrity influencer or even just your normal person can be interacted with at any point a second version of you mirrors your behavior and interaction maintaining a constant digital presence and they've already created some digital replicas here which I think are only going to get better with time you'll have video chat with any of these replicas I think this is a very Grand scope vision for AI and the fact that at this point it's only 6.22 million and that it came out again after a bull Trend means this hasn't yet even had its pump and it has lost 2x from the alltime high that it did achieve relatively bottomed AI project that has huge upside potential this could 100x and still be well below a billion dollar market cap and given this again is a first mover it's got unique technology the money flow can easily float into this once it's discovered out there by The Wider crypto investing and AI investing population and again this is an active team last year important knowledge walked out of the door when a key team member left this year Sensei replicas securely preserve your institutional knowledge ensuring nothing gets lost this is a great technology and I can see this going very far in the future the fourth undiscovered AI gem I have got for you is zero AI zero AI is a generative AI software it allows you to create videos from text prompts it is presently 1.8 million market cap now zero AI replicates an $80 billion product called sora AI Sora AI was brought out by the same guys who brought out chat GPT it allows you to turn your words into amazing videos great for anyone who makes content sells products teaches or loves making videos now if you go try now it will say to you you can't use it because the public cannot use Sora it is only for influencers people of notoriety news outlets but at this present time you cannot use this technology and yet it is extremely high valued and all it is is a text to video generator now zero AI is basically the exact same now think about it Sora is worth 80 billion and zero is worth 1.8 million and just look at the quality of the videos that you get with zero AI the animation is absolutely beautiful now I have personally used zero AI to create b-roll footage for my videos because I can tell zero to give me exactly what I want as a content creator most people use story blocks story blocks allows you to access a video library of what other users have uploaded so you rely on someone else's idea you can never get the exact video you want and the thing is it costs actually a lot of money on a monthly basis to use this software but with zero as long as you've got the tokens you are able to use this technology and get precisely what you want and yeah it's not rubbish stuff look the quality of the videos is actually what I am expecting from from Sora once it actually starts but you can't actually really see much of what is in Sora so zero AI to me I think is just one of those undervalued gems I don't think people really know about I mean look look at the volume the volume is very very low but this is a unique value proposition this is fun and useful use of AI it tells a great story you are basically seeing the mimicking of a very very high value product in cryptocurrency but at a very undervalued price now versus another generative AI like neural AI this has got 46x upside potential just to get to where neural AI is right now and the other great thing about it zero is fully diluted at 1.8 million so this hasn't got a ridiculous High valuation if this had 20% of its Supply in circulation then this would be a 400k market cap that is just showing you how undervalued this cryptocurrency is particularly for this type of technology I mean just think about it Sora is going to be one of the most used products and yet you can bypass that by having a product like zero that gives you exactly what you want that gives you high quality as well and most importantly it's got superb upside potential like with all the others I've spoken about this is new it's relatively unpumped it is bottomed and it never has experienced a bold Trend and that's why I believe this one could violently pump when AI season hits the last undiscovered AI gem I have got for you is Octavia AI Octavia AI is an AI agent that is presently worth only $521,000 market cap Octavia manages web 3 communities this can happen for any type of crypto project whether it's gaming AI meme coins you have got an AI virtual assistant that is able to manage manage the telegram manage the Discord so they delete and moderate abusive messages uniting in-house and external models blockchain internet access data and apis so not only is it an assistant for telegram and Discord but the flagship product is actually for crypto research trading and task automation so whatever task that you may have for it any investing any dollar cost averaging any particular price points or breakouts you have got Octavia that can do the trading for you now I have invested in a lot of AI agents very similar ones such as gtii and GTI aai is in the tens of millions and this is still is not as half a million for the technology you get you have got a very low value and potentially highly pumpable cryptocurrency particular is Once Upon a Time this was worth $250 and now it's 5 so it has come right back down enabling for this to have a pump again now this did come out during that big AI pump season back earlier this year so that is why it was able to pump and get so much hype but now that hype died down and there was a bare Trend this has basically been rinsed right down to the bottom and that enables this to pump ginormously a lot of my best multipliers has come from buying cryptocurrencies that were worth in the hundreds of thousands of dollar market cap so for instance even tits for instance that was near 300K so what you've got here is you've got an extremely pumpable market cap and a bottomed chart coming into possibly the most violent all season of all time definitely the most violent AI season of of all time I think that what we saw at the beginning of this year and last year will be eclipsed and made totally insignificant by the pump we are very likely to see in December all the way through to March April time virtuals protocol is undoubtedly one of the top performing AI agent software that exists in cryptocurrency so if Octavia was to get up to virtuals protocol market cap we would be seeing a 29x upside so Octavia to me represents a project that's in a super trend is at a dgen level market cap is new and has botton and lastly tells a great story AI agents are without a doubt one the most bullish narratives within the AI ecosystem you really are getting in right at the bottom on this project and the downside potential does look very very minimal a bonus coin I have got for you which is actually not AI related is Pepe p now I think that this coin is actually extremely fun for its market cap so it market cap presently is a $106,000 now I personally thought Peppa Pig which is what Pepe pig is based on was an English show but actually they have got an American counterpart which just has American voices basically but Pepe pig is meant to resemble Peppa Pig which is a children or toddler's favorite it now what I really like about Pepe pig is that these guys have got fantastic animations look at this you know this is magnificent now if you've ever watched Peppa Pig if you're a parent or something like that then you'll really appreciate some of these videos I won't play them but I can tell you that they've made episodes which resemble Peppa Pig episodes but are crypto orientated so I think this is a brilliant meme coin now this is on the sui blockchain which is a blockchain that at this point has not got many meme coins particularly not many meme coins that have pumped dramatically so as a result of that this one could have decent money flow flowing to it on salana there are millions of coins being created on almost a daily basis actually whereas on sui much less so that means that this one could actually VI for amongst the best sui meme coins presently now these guys are very active on telegram for from what I have seen and their Twitter is very much up to date and their Twitter has a lot of animations on it too so yeah I think this one is a lot of fun to me a 100K market cap is worth putting a bit of money in if it goes nowhere it goes nowhere but if it goes somewhere wow you can make a lot of money you know 100K market cap 1 million is 10x 10 million is 100x 100 million which would be difficult but looking how tits did I don't see any reason why Pepa Pig couldn't do very very similar particularly when when it has got you know cartoons animations that form the basis of its value and also the community which looks like it's growing I hope you enjoyed this AI special let me know in the comments are there any AI coins that are hidden and secret that I don't know about and a low value and I should know about also let me know in the comments what was your favorite project that I spoke about in this video till next time people I've been the Superman you have been amazing and I'll see you next time don't forget to subscribe it is

rally who's buying here who's potentially selling and how long could this really last let's have a look at data most people aren't considering let's dive deep into the blockchain data this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at 60 cents roughly so we are up 40% today 93% this week 150% this month and More Than 1,500% This here but there's something interesting have a look at this long-term price chart we tend to pump and dump and pump and dump and now we're pumping again are we going to dump since we're very close to those all-time highs now the price chart doesn't show the entire picture because there is token inflation there's more and more tokens hitting the market so in the price chart we are not yet at the all-time high we're very close in the market cap chart though we have crushed through this we are almost at 3x the market cap almost three times as much capital is now locked up in Mantra or the OM token so really realistically we don't really have a resistance there we are in price disc discovery mode so this is not the first time we talk about Mantra on this channel one month ago I published a video when the price was still at 18 cents you have more than 3x since then we are now at 61 cents and so if this is your first time checking out Mantra then maybe you should be following channels like this I try to be early and I try to publish videos regularly now let's have a look at that onchain data let's look at how many many whales are buying into this how many retail investors are buying into this is this just retail pushing this up or is actually the smart money buying this more this is how I see crypto crypto is both a game of skill and of luck and the more you play the game the more you trade the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so the people that have a lot of capital the people that have the whale wallets they tend to be the ones that make the better costs on average at least they tend to have a history history of having made proper calls so let's have a look at this here is in the last month the number of wallets depending on the wallet cohort on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 2,000 om tokens at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail and the number of retail investors didn't grow too much from 1,900 to 1,940 so maybe 2% or so in the middle chart we see the number of medium-sized retails so this is now a 10x in terms of holding compared to the left chart so this is now $10,000 worth of holding That Grew From roughly 300 to 320 so that's already a bit more right that's already 7% or so in the number of medium-sized wallets now the number of Wales Grew From 103 to 123 so roughly 20% growth so what we're seeing here is the larger the wallet the more accumulation happened for the Mantra token in the last month on average it's the smartest money that tended to buy by most this is a very bullish sign this gives us a hint that this might just be the beginning of this rally but let's dive a bit deeper let's look at the mega whales let's look at the people or the wallets that have most of the token Supply let's see how much the top 10 holders hold here is a pie chart of the holder distribution and let's look at the top 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 the top 10 holders hold roughly 50% maybe a bit less than that what others hold we've got some smart contracts that's the top four then we've got three binance wallets another smart contract one unknown wallet another binance wallet so this token is held by the team by the smart contract and by binance what is the balance development of those wallets here is wallet number one tends to accumulate stopped in February middle of February of this year wallet number two also tends to wrong term accumulate in the last few weeks though there was a bit of distribution of maybe 25 million the largest wallet though bought more than a 100 million here's wallet number three also accumulation wallet number four with very few transactions it doesn't have that much of a balance anymore only 50 million so there can't be too much sell pressure from this wallet anymore wallet number five very few transactions rather a bit of accumulation recently so 10 days ago there was an inbound transaction wallet number six tended to sell recently but it's very close to zero number seven accumulated number eight went slightly down nine accumulated 10 is going sideways probably just for Market making so it looks like the mega whales also tend to be mainly accumulating so we see the number of whales growing they're growing much faster than retail we also see that the heaviest of the wallets tend to rather increase their balance again a positive sign now not everything is Rosy because binance is known for manipulating the price and unfortunately we do see a lot of trading volume on binance here so this is the big guys playing with the price they have a lot of token so they probably don't want to crash the price now but have a look at this most of the trading volume happens on binance now this is the spot market and here's the same for the Perpetual Futures Market 11,000 per of trading volume this is relative to the market cap x.com is simply just a Rebrand of binance so basically binance is owning this whole thing we have already seen this on chain so this is by no means the most natural rally but binance seems to be planning something binance has quite a lot of stake in this and so it does appear to me that the price can really further that being said there might be a sharp turnaround at some point so what I believe is the most likely scenario here is that binance is probably going to try to generate a lot of attention with a massive price rally and once enough people use leverage to push up the price higher then potentially they might offload then they potentially might crash the price so it's very very important to take profit here one approach could be to set a trailing stop loss so you don't have a fixed stop loss but you adjust the stop loss as the price Rises so you see the price Rising is getting pushed up by binance but then at some point you increase your stop- loss at some point the thing turns around and then you exit fast you don't wait to get dumped on if this

Zro Tokenomics,  #layerzero #zro #crypto","layer zero the airdrop everybody had been talking about first crashed down massively but now it's just Rising again like a phoenix From the Ashes let's have a look at some onchain data let's find out how much longer this R can potentially last and in case you haven't yet tried it out maybe you are eligible for the airdrop as well the link how to get that airdrop is down below below this video so this week Z is doing actually quite fine the price went up by almost 4 % we are now at $3.79 and that happened while Bitcoin pretty much didn't move at all but I said things haven't always been that Rosy we initially got a dump from $4 all the way to $250 and now we are reclaiming those initial highs we are currently at a fully diluted market cap of 3.8 billion they currently trading market cap so what's actually currently floating is a bit over 400 million so we can already see something very interesting the circulating Supply is only 11% of all of Supply the supply of layer Zer were roughly 9x from here let's have a look at how fast those token unlocks actually happen because that's in general one of the most important things in any cryptocurrency right we want to see the supply development in order to have an idea where the price might go because price is a result of Demand versus Supply if Supply grows too fast then of course the price might have a hard time time now layer zero is a backend technology that enables to move funds across blockchains so if you've ever used a bridge then maybe layer zero was in the background that's why you might be eligible for an airdrop even though you've never consciously use layer zero you might have done this by using products that use layer zero so let's have a look at the toomics layer zero got a lot of funding a series B supported by Andre and horovitz by seoa by Circle that was at a valuation of 3 billion and 120 million had been raised now we are at a valuation of 3.8 billion earlier funding rounds had similar investors a bit over 2 years ago the valuation was still at 1 b135 million raised and before that it was mainly the crypto ecosystem that put money in at a much lower valuation with much less Capital raised but still in total this is quite a lot of money 263 million raised by by layer zero and all of those investors want to cash out at some point with a profit right ideally with a multiple X profit now the big question is when are they going to cash out and are they going to cash out while we are holding the token also on Cryptor rank doio we've got a vesting page and over here is a timeline but also a chart and this shows us over time how the tokens unlock but instead of using this I personally prefer to use token. unlocks do app and so over here we see that the circulating Supply is actually not expanding up until June of next year so on the short term there isn't too much to worry about the big question is what happens then in those few months before the unlock if there are enough people that bet on falling prices at the time we might even see a short squeeze so that's when market makers and Market manipulators buy up a lot of tokens to force liquidate short sellers right now we can already bet on falling prices of layer zero I don't think it's the best thing to do right now I don't think it makes a lot of sense to bet now on falling prices of Z there's simply too much attention and there is also a lot of ownership by the large centralized exchanges here have a look at this binance has more than 25% of trading volume and the Perpetual Futures Market is also relatively active so the large players don't necessarily have an incentive to push down the price at the moment but as an investment over the next 2 3 4 years it's very very important to keep a close eye on those unlocks very smart people got in with a valuation of $3 billion so $3.8 billion doesn't seem too terrible now the big question is why did those smart Venture capitalists buy at that valuation on chain I don't really see that much momentum so I don't have a clear answer for this yet let's have a quick look at the data so this comes directly from the Explorer of layer zero it's layer zeros scan.com this is the number of messages over time here we've got the number of chain paths also not really doing well the number of protocols that are actively using layer zero and here's a split by different networks or different blockchains on D analytics we see pretty much the exact same data on the left we've got the number of transactions on the right we've got the number of users it doesn't seem like the transactions are concentrated in just a few users right there is a very strong correlation between transactions and user account here the same data again on june. comom so really not that much activity so a lot of the hype recently a lot of the hype is related to the airdrop it's simply just that you can now claim for free your zro tokens and I've tried to claim some unfortunately I did not get any but this is the website it's layer zero. foundation/ eligibility and the link will be posted in the video description make sure you don't just search YouTube for that and follow random links here this for example is an AI generated video that tells you about this airdrop and in here we've got actually a fake link so once you go over here to this fake website which looks very realistic right it looks like the real website once you go to this fake website and then you click on check you don't even have to paste in any kind of address you just click on check it already tells you that you can claim some zro so don't go on websites like this the real website is layer zero. foundation/ eligibility now let's have a look at a few onchain statistics because again Z is available of course on pretty much any chain since it's an interoperability protocol anyways let's have a look at where most of that Capital currently is on chain and let's also see whether or not the people that claim the token are selling off quickly so we've got a version on ethereum with 6,000 holders we've got another version on the binance smart chain with 19,000 holders ERS then there's polygon also 7,000 holders roughly the optimism version has almost 50,000 for arbitrum we've got 4,000 holders for other launch we roughly 4,000 holders but look at this arbitrum has almost half a million holders very very interesting the base chain also has 880,000 holders it's a lot of holders but of course most of those holders didn't buy the token that simply just got it airdrop let's have a look at where actually the capital is because that's a problem with an air right if you simply just have two or three cents of the token you're counted as a holder in that Explorer but when you want to know where actually the capital is moving on chain not on the centralized exchanges it makes sense to put a holder threshold on those wallets as in we want to count the wallets that have at least $10,000 worth of the token or $100,000 worth of the token and so let's go through that this is the ethereum based token on the left we've got a minimum threshold of 200 tokens so each wallet here has at least $800 worth of layer zero tokens in their wallet there now 1,500 such wallets in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $8,000 worth of the token on the right we have the Wales that's now $80,000 worth of the token the number of holders is increasing over time but again most of this is very likely airdrop claims here's the same number on the binance smart chain look at how much fewer whale wallets there are there's only eight whight wallets versus more than 200 on ethereum here's a token on polygon same thing very few whales same is true for optimism here's Avalanche and here is arbitrum so arbitrum actually still does have quite a few whales the number of holders is excessive right with almost half a million versus only 6,000 on ethereum even though again on ethereum we've got way more whales here's the number of holders on base also not really that large in terms of Wales so we see that most of the onchain action happens on ethereum and on arbitrum ethereum doesn't have a lot of holders but most of those holders have very Deep Pockets arbitrum has a lot of holders but also some of them have some Deep Pockets again it's 215 whales on ethereum versus 60 whales or so on arbitrum my impression is that layer zero is probably not going to make huge gains because it already has quite a bit of a market cap but it's also unlikely going to crash simply because there's too much vested in interest in a good price performance I believe that short term there will be some price manipulation we've already got the listing on the centralized exchanges we've already got the derivatives the Perpetual Futures on those centralized exchanges and the vesting of those French Capital still takes more than a year from now now I'm not going to buy any Z that's because there's not that much upside but also because I see the General market as not that healthy at the moment because maybe you haven't seen this yet the stable coin market cap isn't growing since April of this year unfortunately crypto isn't expanding anymore there isn't any more Fiat flowing into the system the game is becoming 100% player versus player thus what I'm actually looking at is opportunities to short the alt coins I'm not going to short layer zero because the investing unlocks are too far out in the future but I am shorting tokens that have pretty bad tokenomics if you see an expanding token Supply in a market that doesn't see a lot of new buyers it's very unlikely that the demand can grow as quickly as a supply thus at least the relative variation of a lot of altcoins are likely going to go down relative to ethereum and relative to bitcoin and so that's my central bet at the moment I like to bet on falling prices of charts like this since beginning of the year this went down by more than 60% and it is one of my largest altcoin positions I'm betting on this to continue to fall I made tutorials on how to make money with this on how to short this asset I'm also talking about what asset this actually is that's all available for the premium members so instead of trying to find the needle in the Hy stack the one altcoin that might outperform Bitcoin in ethereum I'm betting on the hstack on the vast majority of altcoins doing poorly I'm betting on this for example to go down and if you want to know how to do this then again there is premium it's the bitcoin.com if your crypto portfolio doesn't yet justify premium there's also a free telegram group the link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting with you over there well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SGzxKUzsVU,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Avalanche', 'Arbitrum', 'Optimism', 'Polygon', 'LayerZero', 'JUST', 'Threshold',

people aren't looking at let's consider how much longer this R could last is this manipulation by the Wales is this accumulation by a lot of retail investors let's dive deep into the details so today we are up more than 50% and that is pretty much all the gains we have seen since the listing on coin market cap because that listing happened on the 27th of May so two days ago but actually when we look on chain we had quite a bit of a rally before the listing on coin market cap already more than 400% now here's something interesting have a look at the bottom over here this is the trading volume and in general there is a high correlation between price appreciation and trading volume so whenever trading volume is high the price tends to be high whenever trading volume dies down the price can correct so this simply shows that the more attention there is on a token the higher the price can go right there is a correlation between activity and price but let's have a look at how much higher this can climb let's look at the liquidity pool sizes on Solana so this is all the top meme coins on Solana beer coin has already the seventh largest liquidity pool but that doesn't mean that there's no more upside dog with head has a three times larger liquidity pool book of Meme and slur almost 10 times that of beer so if beer coin was to become the largest meme coin on the Solana chain directly on chain not on the centralized exchanges then we've got another 10x from here this is the best outcome I believe will that happen your guess is as good as mine but it's always good to have some kind of an idea what the potential upside is right when we're trading risk versus reward the largest reward that I believe is realistic is a 10x now you can already see from the beginning of this video that I'm not going to bore you with the marketing jazz on the website because this is not how we can get an edge versus others mem coin trading is a game of having more data than others and the data that's on the website is not necessarily anything that's giving you any kind of Advantage meme cont trading in the end is still a player versus player game and what I'm trying to find out in this video is whether or not this is manipulation by the whales or if there's actually a lot of people jumping on this now is this an organic rally let's have a look at the Twitter profile interesting love there's zero followings but 130,000 followers with roughly 4 to 5K views per post there are 6,000 wallets that trade in last 24 hours so that kind of makes sense so it doesn't look like Twitter is necessarily manipulated there's 1,300 more buyers than sellers in the last 24 hours that's what's explaining the price R so it's not the whales that are dumping on this r at least at the moment very important with fresh meme coins like beer coin is always how safe is the token is the Smart contract safe when you buy the token on chain is there a chance that you can't sell it anymore for example because there is Honey Pot token code in there which then Force locks up your capital and you can never withdraw it that's actually very common so what I like to do is I like to go to Dex tools. and I like to search for the token and the results we get here is that there's no alerts we've got a positive Community Trust vote and also a nice Dex tools score so this all looks good an instant Rock pull here is very unlikely what's also interesting is how the trading volume of this recent really is smaller than the trading volume initially this is healthy this shows little manipulation little wash trading now with any mem coin It's always important that there's more new investors coming into the token versus recurring Traders right when it's just recurring Traders it's player versus player then the people that got in early they exit they dump the price when there's still new people jumping on a token then there's simply an expanding investor base more Capital more Capital means higher prices so let's have a look at the number of new Traders versus recurring Traders over time we can see this in this chart over here the recurring Traders are in orange the new Traders are in purple and we had a massive influx on the 26th of May that then balanced out on the 27th and 28th but now we see another rally but we don't yet see a lot of new firsttime Traders very very interesting so it seems like the people that are currently buying might partially be the heavy weights as well might partially be the larger wallets and so let's have a look at that split up let's look at the whale activity versus large retail medium retail and small retail and we can see that small retail is slightly growing over time but there's no massive composition change over those last days so when the price is currently rising and the activity across all wallet cohorts is the same as before then that would imply that the price might continue to rise now I want to point out something regarding the hours of the day when does it actually make sense to buy meme coins within the day is there some kind of cyclicality I believe the the answer here is a clear yes have a look at this there is waves whenever new people come in and it seems to be bottoming out at around midnight UTC right midnight to 2 a.m. UTC this is when we have very little trading activity very few new and recurring Traders trading and we've already talked about that effect right when there's low activity prices tend to be lower when there's a lot of activity when there's a lot of attention prices tend to rise so it might make sense to always buy around midnight UTC time zone at least for the Very Fresh meme coins I will continue to make updates on beer coin I will continue to look at the onchain metrics the tool that you've seen

donations in crypto now in this video we are going to look at onchain analytics and we're going to look at who is buying and selling the token to estimate how much longer this price Val can potentially last so let's look at data most people aren't considering unless you've been living under a rock you've probably heard about the news Donald Trump's campaign says it will begin accepting contributions through cryptocurrency so this was 5 days ago and so we've got two cryptocurrencies that benefit from this we've got the MAA Trump token that's currently above $12 and that's also registered on several blockchains on ethereum the B smart chain Solana and base but there's also the ma head token that went up way more it almost 10x in the last week we're going to focus this video on that token it's only available on ethereum the fully diluted market cap is roughly half of the original ma token and so I made two videos on that original ma a initially nobody was interested in the video so blue is the performance of that video gray is the performance of a typical video but now as the price picks up the views are also picking up so that video was released when the price was still at $6 now it's at 12 so if you want to be early next time feel free to subscribe here I try to publish videos early and regularly but again for this this video we're going to look at the token that's only a fraction of a scent we want to know how much longer this rally can last and I always like to look at onchain data because that's the power of crypto trading we don't just have to look at Price charts and draw random lines Etc we can actually look at the transactions on chain and we can see is this small retail that are currently buying is this the big whales that are buying who's pumping who's dumping how much potential momentum is there still not using that kind of data I believe is a mistake and so I have built a tool the tool counts the number of retail investors versus whale investors on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold a million Maga tokens so at the current price that's roughly $67 that's what I'd consider retail for the middle chart we do a cut off that's higher than that by a 10x so that's not 10 million tokens or $6,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got the number of Wales that's now1 million tokens or $60,000 worth of the token isn't that fascinating how different those charts look retail continuous to accumulate barely Sals in aggregate medium-sized retail does take some profit but still in the last week the number of medium-sized retail also grew by roughly 20% the whales they stopped accumulating one week ago still the price in the last week went up by almost 10x so what does this tell us it tells us that this this is a 100% retail driven rally and that the whales aren't dumping on retail yet in other words I believe this is a pretty solid rally because you do want the price to be supported by a lot of people not just by a few because How likely is it that this chart is going to suddenly turn around and fall I think it's way less likely than this chart here on the right if it's a few Mega whales that influence the price we've got a problem if it's overall retail that continues to buy in that's much much more healthy and so I don't have a crystal ball either how much longer this can last but I will continue following those retail investor numbers very very closely and I will continue to make update videos over here again feel free to subscribe a like would be very much appreciated as well I try to make the videos not longer as they need so if you want to help this channel grow feel free to give this a thumbs up this tool by the way is developed myself you can pluck in any ethereum based token In Here Also the tokens on the base chain and tokens on avalange and optimism and arbitrum you can plug in any token into this tool it's available down below at the Bitcoin tray.com in the

Solana is not getting spared from the price declines let's have a look at some onchain metrics let's have a look at actual usage is this potentially an opportunity to buy this dip because I believe the best way to beat the market is to have better data than most others right if we want to figure out where bottoms and tops are we need to find out who's buying who's selling who's using Solana now we all know what Solana have been used for in the last months and that was meme coin trading just have a look at this this is dec.com and this is all tokens ordered by their liquidity pool size and we pretty much only see meme coins here Solana completely turned into a meme coin casino and since memec coins don't have any real world usage it's 100% player versus player and of course there's a luck component involved but there's also skill involved as in the people that are more skilled tend to make make money from the memec coin game thus the longer the game goes on the more Capital gets concentrated in a few hands and the majority loses their funds that's the reason why transactions tend to decline over time if there's no new people coming into the space now let's compare Solana to other blockchains this is defy Lama and this shows the total value locked development in the last month here on the second last column Solana lost 11% of its total value in the last last month with that number it's pretty much in the middle ethereum lost to a similar degree Bas lost even more arbitrum lost a little bit less this is then how that looks like over time this was the first defi summer in 2021 then we saw the nice Revival since October of last year this is where mem con trading started and now in the recent past we see again quite a bit of a hiccup the liquidity on decentralized exchanges isn't yet that much affected and that's quite surprising because the people that deposit their Capital into decentralized exchanges into those liquidity pools they get their return paid out via the trading fees so when you're trading say on radium then you're paying a fee and the fee goes partially to liquidity pool providers when trading volume goes down then in theory the return of the capital providers goes down as well and thus the incentive to deposit goes down as well so there should be at least long-term a correlation with the capital in decentralized exchanges and trading activity trading activity went down but the capital so far is still relatively constant so here's that trading activity it peaked out in the middle of March of this year since then we rather see a decline other narratives unfortunately can't catch up either this is the platform fees of nft marketplaces on Solana that peaked out even a bit earlier at the beginning of March of this year but also a very clear downtrend unfortunately and and if history is any indication that low level can sustain for quite a while now not all charts are going down an interesting chart that's going up is how much Solana is being staked so more and more so gets locked up this should reduce the supply and with a reduction in Supply the price in theory should go up so have a look at this that's a Solana that's been staked measured in s so and this continues to increase quite a bit but here's the problem Solana also has token in inflation we've got a circulating supply of 462 million so tokens this is the supply development over time and we are currently at an annual inflation rate of 5.2% roughly 5.2% of the current Supply equals to 24 million so tokens that hit the market every year let's check this out again this is in total 24 million but this didn't happen in one year this happened over the span of 3 years so it's roughly only onethird of the newly added Supply every year that gets locked up so the staking program is relevant but relative to the supply expansion it can't unfortunately supersede this so there's still long-term sell pressure on S so this is not like ethereum where we've got a shrinking Supply or like Bitcoin where a l Supply gets scooped up by the Bitcoin ETF or where some of that Supply even gets lost for Bitcoin on average roughly 2% per year gets lost now let's have a look at relative performance I don't just like to look at us dollar charts right because when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up then Sol tends to go up as well and vice versa what I believe is more important is outperformance because that's in the end the reason why we get into altcoins in the first place right we take on more Risk by buying Solana over Bitcoin thus we want to get more performance right if you take on more risk you need to have more performance and so this is the chart most people look at this is just Solana in US dollars and historically we seem to be relatively high and we can see very nicely that since Q3 of last year so performed quite well in terms of US Dollars again but there's another measure this is Solana dominance this is how much of all of cryptocurrencies market cap is in Solana and that's currently at roughly 3% and that is somewhat at the Historical High here Solana relative to bitcoin it's not at an historical High there's actually quite a bit of room if Solana was to catch up with bitcoin's performance reach those historical highs that' be another outperformance of roughly 80% but here's the chart that I believe is actually the most important and that is Solana relative to ethereum because Solana and ethereum are competing for similar spaces and here we see how nicely those tops align we have recently hit several times the peaks of 2021 and the potential upside isn't that massive anymore it's 35% until the a gets thin again the potential downside though is pretty high right- 66% or maybe in the worst case minus 80% now why do the tops align here so well in the ethereum based chart I believe the answer is correlation have a look at those various altcoin correlation coefficients relative to bitcoin and relative to ethereum the higher the number is the more those two assets tend to move in tendem with one another and the numbers here in the First Column tend to be lower than the number in the second column this is true for the 90-day correlation coefficient it's also true for the onee correlation coefficient the numbers to ethereum tend to be higher than to bitcoin so most altcoins tend to be higher correlated to ethereum so actually what we are doing with buying an altcoin is we try to outperform ethereum not necessarily Bitcoin the kind of person that buys into Bitcoin is not necessarily the same kind of person that buys into ethereum or into Solana the ethereum and Solana investors tend to be more speculative in nature they tend to enjoy this player versus player game much more the Bitcoin investor simply just wants to allocate and forget maybe Diversified together with the stock Investments and the property Investments and so when it's the same kind of person that buys ethereum and that buys Solana then that same kind of person might also decide to enter and exit the market pretty much the entire portfolio that's probably one of the reasons why we see that much correlation with ethereum to the altcoins and that's probably also the reason why we see those tops align so nicely for Solana relative to ethereum and so here's the reason why the market is suffering so much this here is the stable coin market cap and that market cap unfortunately isn't growing for the last 2 to 3 months there's no more fiat currency flowing into crypto that can push up the prices in aggregate here's a more long-term chart of that stablecoin market cap when this is going up then crypto is expanding when this is going down we tend to be in a bare Market currently we are expanding again since October of last year but unfortunately that expansion has recently stopped and maybe we will see a crash again very similar to the Tera Luna collapse right when the anchor protocol went belly up I don't really like to get risk on right now I believe the risk versus reward isn't really warranted for Solana I believe that there's still too much Capital locked up in the decentralized exchanges relative to the trading volume so people don't really get a lot of trading fees at the same time we don't see a lot of money flowing into crypto as a whole at the same time we see that there's maybe another 30% outperformance versus ethereum but a lot of potential underperformance again rative valuation is pretty high and when the situation is so Bleak why not bet on falling prices on things like this I'm shorting this token over here very little volatility very constant underperformance because again the token Supply is increasing relatively fast and I've made a tutorial on how to bet on falling prices over here feel free to check it out it's part of the premium membership it's down below it's the Bitcoin trade.com this is also where I'm sharing what this asset actually is if you've got like $3,000 or so to put on this short premium should be for free again I can't of course guarantee this there's always risk in any investment but that's what I'm personally doing right I'm not trying to find the needle in the Hy stack the one asset that might outperform the rest right now there's no more crypto expansion it's player versus player so why not simply go with the Hast deck underperforming right and most altcoins do worse than Bitcoin most of the time why not bet on that and get the odds in our favor if your portfolio isn't yet large enough

700% let's have a look at what's driving this who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at onchain metrics and try to find data most people are not considering so here we are we are currently at 26 Cents and since listing on coin market cap on the 21st of September we are up almost 700% now since the liquidity pool had been opened on the 11th of September the price increased more than 300 ,000% so as usual early adopters get most gains the vast majority of profit had been made early now mang has now a market cap of 260 million and with that it's in similar territory to Sundog and Giga chat and with a 2X it would flip Nero and get close to book of Meme and Cat in the dog's world with a 4X we are close to Brett with a 10x we are flipping Bonk and rivaling dog with head so that gives a first idea what the potential upside is we probably not going to see 100x from here but a 10x relatively speaking wouldn't necessarily be completely unreasonable now I'm not going to walk you through the website because the website doesn't give us any ET right this is a player versus player game and we want to look at data most people do not have access to and it's unlikely that that data is pictures of Happy Hippos now let's first see at potential manipulation on Twitter we've got 55,000 followers on telegram we've got 4,000 subscribers mang is one of of the largest trending tokens with 4 million worth of liquidity in the largest of the pools and it's got 28,000 holders so this is somewhat in line with the following on Twitter now let's have a look at when those holders actually came to the Token so what we've got over here is the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on any given day and we see that especially the 17th of September had seen a massive influx of first-time Traders the 17 18 of September was over here and it was still before listing on coin market cap we then saw quite a bit of a sell off on the 19th and that coincided with quite a bit of a drop in price almost 50% and now we are somewhat balanced again with the price stagnating in the last 2 to 3 days now I like to segregate demand and supply for retail investors versus whale investors because if it's a smart money right if it's the big guys that are buying this is potentially positive is a game of both luck and skill and the more it's being played the more Capital goes to the people with some skill and so the people that have more money they tend to also make the better call so if the whales are accumulating this is potentially good and so here's the chart that does that segregation it starts on the 10th of September goes all the way to today and we can see how the fraction of small retail tended to decline over time now small retail means wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token medium size retail means the wallets between ,000 and $10,000 large retail between 10,000 and 100 and Wales is everything above a 100,000 and so what can we see here when we take away small and medium-sized retail and we only look at the wallets that have at least $10,000 worth of the token we see how this is nicely increasing over time so the whales have more and more impact on the price we can also see how the trading volume over time is still increasing so instead of normalizing the trading volume to 100% we can just look at this in Us doll and yes there had been a peak on the 27th and this is also where the rally somewhat peaked but it seems like we stay at an elevated level for quite a bit and again this is driven by the whales and by large retail now here's something fascinating we can count the number of holders based on different holding thresholds and if you just look at the number of Wales that's actually not going up so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 10,000 mudang tokens so that's currently at 4,000 and it's stated again at the 27th for the chart in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's 100,000 tokens for the chart on the right we have a minimum holding of a million tokens so at current prices this equals a minimum holding of $2,600 this equals $226,000 this equals $260,000 so the number of whales is not going up but the trading volume by those whales is going up and check this this out this is the token balance held by different segments so it's not more whales but it's the existing whales that are simply buying more and more and so what could be going on here I believe that the centralized exchanges and that market makers continue to accumulate mudang because it's not just anymore radium where the token can be bought we now have Mexi in the mix as well we've also got xt. comom which is related to binance and we even have Perpetual Futures Trading so what I believe is going on here is that more and more of the token gets accumulated by the centralized exchanges potentially increasing the volatility in the future but definitely having an interest that at some point the price is higher than today so what we've seen in the past was simply just accumulation by more and more people we have seen organic growth what we're going to see in the future will be less organic it will be driven by the whales it will be driven by the centralized exchanges but it's unlik likely that they're going to dump very quickly because again overall the accumulation trend is still somewhat healthy if it's your first time here Fe you to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you're interested in

longterm, Simon Cat Tokenomics,  #cat #memecoin #crypto","Simon's catch token is the meme coin that's been launched by a variety of centralized exchanges there were already some rumors around this in July of this year have a look at this the Bonk guy made a tweet that's someone that made almost 14 million off of Bonk and that's with an initial capital of 16k and so that's what we are all dreaming about right following the winners can be a winning strategy now why especially this token what's so special about Simon's Cat the official account of the binance smart chain retweet the Simon's Cat tweet and so how do I know about all of this it's because of YouTuber sep montgomry so he's obviously very early in a lot of tokens feel free to follow his account he still got less than 23k subscribers so he described the launch via token F and how to get the airdrop by holding the Floy token so that might have been one of the reasons why the Floy Eno token went up quite a bit but now with the launch of Simon's Cat we've seen a retracement of Flo since listing on coin market cap we are up 56% and as expected all major centralized exchanges are part of the party the token can be bought on binance on gate.io on HDX Etc but what's even more interesting is that the cat token is one of the main tokens currently traded on the binance smart chain it's got a ton of liquidity almost 50 million combined across those two polls and that's at a fully diluted market cap of only roughly 200 million so since the creation of the liquidity pool on the binance smart chain we have seen an increase of 86% a bit more than what we have seen since listing on coin Market capap because that obviously takes a bit longer and so the big question is how much longer can this R now last and I'm not going to walk you through the website and S you the marketing desk we're going to look at onchain analytics most people are not considering let's have a look at how much manipulation there might potentially be so the Twitter account of the Simon catch token has 460,000 followers on chain we've got 30,000 holders so either most people that are following Twitter haven't bought the token whatsoever or they've bought this through the centralized exchanges maybe it was advertised over there but it seems like they're not directly on the bining smart chain so there's 15 times more Twitter followers than holders that's not very common now let's have a look at those holders of course the largest wallet is with binance no surprise over here so there might be some potential manipulation through derivative contracts through Perpetual Futures at some point point in the future but what's also interesting is that there's quite a lot of Holdings also by various smart contracts so that's probably how the team is going to cash out over time there's 10% in the foundation 30% is pre-sales to investors then for whatever reason the project also needs a treasury allocated money to market makers and another Community growth fund so a lot of ownership by the team still now in order to figure out where the price might go from here I like to look at both demand and Supply now the issue with Supply is again we don't really know what's going to happen because the team is holding a lot but for the demand we can at least look at some parts of the demand we don't know what happens with the centralized exchanges but we can have a look at what happens on chain on the binance smart chain and so check this out this is the number of holders over time with different holding thresholds so on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 20 million tokens so at the current price that's roughly $500 worth of Simon's Cat for the chart in the middle we go a 10x from that so that's now a minimum holding of $55,000 for the chart on the right we go another 10x that's a minimum holding of $50,000 so we see the initial big spike due to the air drop to flocky holders and since that air drop the number of retail investors grew by roughly 3 to 400 so that's a growth of maybe 15% within 10 days the number of mediumsized holders didn't really grow the number of whales also didn't grow but at least they also didn't sell so this is not not a case where the whales are dumping on retail we do see growth by retail investors but it's not Ultra fast especially since we've had a launch across so many centralized exchanges and with that much involvement by the big guys now what's the upside potential let's simply compare market caps so over here on coin gecko we can have a look at different meme coins so there is a categories tab over here and within the categories we can see the meme coins and the largest of all of them is Dogecoin with almost 15 million of Market cap now let's have a look at the newer ones we've got dog with hat and bonk they are at 1.5 1.2 billion Floy is also at 1.2 and when we scroll down a bit we find Simon's Cat over here so the market cap is around 200 depending on if you take the current market cap or the fully diluted one here in this overview on coin gecko it's at 160 million it's in the same ballpark and so let's play with the Positive scenario let's say we get into similar regions with Mock and with cat in the dog's world and maybe with popcat then we are looking at a maximum upside of maybe 3 to 4X from here relatively speaking of course when all of crypto is going up and Bitcoin suddenly doubles then of course pretty much all of the meme coins are going to triple and quadruple but simply just in terms of outperformance I think 3 to 4X is probably the ceiling and the big big question is are those centralized exchanges going to dump before we see such a r and that's probably all dependent on how quickly the number of holders grows if the growth here stalls then probably some whales are going to De risk and that's a problem in general with crypto right now we need some kind of minimum return expectation if we get into something that risky but the returns probably aren't that high anymore given that the capital inflow into crypto as a whole is somewhat slow now so have a look at this this is the total market cap of various stable coins and it's used to rise very very quickly in 2021 until we saw saw the Terra Luna collapse the US implosion that started a bare Market which then subsequently turned around in October of last year so since October of last year we do see how various meme coins can perform quite well especially on Solana then in April we've seen quite a bit of a Slowdown and now we are slowly picking up again in August but it's definitely not as quickly as we have seen in 2021 and the end of 2022 and so I will keep monitoring this chart keep looking at the growth of the Simon Cat token how many retail investors are really getting in so there will be update videos on this channel if you're interested in those updates feel free to subscribe I publish

Tokenomics,  #catinadogsworld #mew #crypto","cat in a dog's world or the M token has almost doubled in the last week we are back into meme coin season the question is is this already the end of the rally historically if we zoom out this might look pretty bad however once we look behind the curtain on chain there's actually some interesting statistics most people aren't considering so this is the r I'm referring to we're currently at 0.7 CS the price is up 82% this week and I've published videos on the mute token a long time back 120 days ago over here another video 102 days ago and at the time the price was only at 0.4 I publish videos on Meme coins regularly and I try to be early and so if this is your first time researching the M token maybe consider following channels like this right again I try to publish videos when most people aren't yet considering a token now here's the potential problem with the price chart this is all the history we've got on coin market cap in we are very close to all-time highs in the price and this because historically we dumped afterwards could be a potential warning but the rally that we're seeing recently is somewhat different let me show you some interesting onchain data here's the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders on any given day for the M token and on the 20th we've seen a massive influx of firsttime Traders on the 21st we even saw more firsttime Traders than recurring Traders on a single day the 20th was over here the 21st was over here now why does the number of first-time Traders matter it's because it shows that the investor base is growing right and the more people get into a token the higher the price can potentially go right it's new capital it's new people getting into a token that in the end increases the price long term and so I always like to look at charts like this on the 23rd unfortunately we've seen more recurring Traders than firsttime Traders and since the 23rd we aren't growing that much anymore and of course today has just started so we can't forget about the 24th this data is not yet complete now here's another very interesting chart and especially this part of the chart is interesting this is the retail investor as in how much of daily trading volume is generated by the wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the me token that tends to increase over time and that's health because retail investors tend to not sell as quickly compared to large retail or Wales thus when the retail investors are now buying in more and more I believe that the price flow is also likely going to increase over time now this is a normalized chart right the simply just looks at the percent of trading volume done by those different cohorts here's the same chart but not normalized to 100% here it's shown in raw US dollar amount and we can clearly see again on the 21st attention peaked massively for mu and it stays at that elevated level now there is something interesting though and that is that the number of holders interestingly enough isn't growing so even though there were a lot of new firsttime Traders when we look at the number of wallets with 100,000 tokens here on the left so that's roughly $762 worth of the token we actually don't see that going up and we go another 10x from that so a minimum holding of $110,000 we've seen how this has stabilized a bit so that's in the last 2 weeks when we look at the number of Wales so that's a minimum holding now of $76,000 roughly that has grown in the last month but the growth had been relatively modest relative to the dump that preceded so how is it possible that the number of Wales is shrinking by more than 20% while the price is close to all-time highs I think it's because trading volume is moving from directly the Solana chain to the centralized exchanges so have a look at this we've still got 133% of trading volume on chain on radium but we do now have bit hump and bybit and okx also within the mix htx and gate.io are also involved there's also Perpetual Futures and that's especially active on binance so the very big boys are now entering as well and they're likely going to potentially manipulate the price especially in the direction most people aren't anticipating in other words if most people are now betting on falling prices on those centralized exchanges of this token if most people think that this is again a peak and that we're going to dump in cat in a darkg world and the centralized exchanges might simply buy up the token more and manipulate this upwards making money with liquidation fees so what happened in the past with the token might not be indicative of what's going to happen in the future simply because the nature of the trading is not changing as it's shifting from Solana onchain to the centralized exchanges if you got some value of this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly I try to be early feel

America great again Donald Trump is gaining ground against Camila Harris and with that political success comes success in the tokens there are two magga tokens or Mega tokens one Mega head one Mega Trump in this video we're going to look at onchain data of Mega Trump we're trying to find out how much longer this current really can last we're currently at $520 we are up almost 25% today and more than 60% this week and the really pretty much started when Trump gained more and more popularity because check this out this is poly Market Trump now has a likelihood of winning of 53% versus only 46% for CA Harris now there are two Trump related tokens we're going to talk about the mega Trump token the larger of the two today it's got a market cap of 250 million it's pretty much the largest politically themed token Constitution da is simply just a manipulated token by binance a pump and dump scheme I talked about this on this channel as well feel free to check it out but it's really Mega Trump that's the leader and to a degree one could call this token also a meme coin and when we look at the universe of meme coins 250 million is actually not that large we've got all kinds of random tokens that are larger than this Giga chat has almost two times the size SPX 6900 as well I made videos on both just recently and yeah there is potential upside if we just go by the market cap but here's the thing we don't just want to eyeball potential we want to look at buyers and sellers we want to see the data most people aren't considering we want to see at who's potentially dumping the token as well now the meat Trump token can not just be bought on chain but also in centralized exchanges it's available on Mexi it's available on x.com which is affiliated with binance it can also be bought on gate.io and have a look at this here is pancake swap as well this is a decentralized exchange so this gives us a first hint Mega Trump is not just listed on ethereum it's listed on various other chains as well and this makes onchain analytics a bit tougher because now we have to somewhat aggregate this buyer and sell Dynamic there are some buyers on ethereum some sellers on Solana how does this all add up now let's first look at the split so we've got 37,000 holders on ethereum we've got 11,000 holders on the binance smart chain also 11,000 holders on Bas and 24,000 holders on Solana now those holder numbers can be manipulated somebody can write a script create a lot of wallets that all buy very small amounts and so what I like to do is I like to look at minimum holding thresholds how many wallets are there really that have say $1,000 worth of the token or $10,000 worth of the token or $100,000 worth of the token on the left side we've got the number of wallets with 200 tokens on the right side we've got the number of wallets with 20,000 tokens so we go at 10x from each of those charts there are 7,500 wallets with roughly $11,000 worth of the token because again the the token is worth $5 so roughly 30,000 of those 38,000 holders have less than $11,000 worth for the chart in the middle it's $10,000 worth of the token so roughly 1,600 wallets and on the right another 10x that's what I'd consider the Wales $100,000 worth of the token and we can see how this is very different across holders retail continues to buy and buy medium-sized retail also tends to buy but the whales right the ones that have 100 times more tokens compared to the left side they started selling already around the middle of January of this year now that's on ethereum here are the same numbers on the binance smart chain so the same kind of holding thresholds we can see there's way less such wallets so really it's ethereum that's moving the price much more than the binance mar chain here we've got base a similar size to the binance mar chain and here we've got Solana Solana does move the price somewhat so among retail it's roughly 1/3 of the holders among Wales not really again the vast majority of capital for the Wales is on ethereum and so that then explains why we get this crashes every now and then right this is a 90% Crash from the 1st of June to the 22nd of September that was triggered by continued sell pressure by the Wales and unfortunately there are still a lot of Wales left each of those wallets has $100,000 worth of the token so that's $25 million worth at minimum and and on chain there isn't that much liquidity right there's only 7 million in the largest pool on ethereum and half of that is the rep ethereum right only the other half is the Trump token so it's really just 3 and A2 Million worth of liquidity on ethereum the whales have way more tokens in their wallet compared to what's floating and the big question is can the centralized exchanges digest that potential selling pressure there's 19 million worth of the token held on Mexi and another four .7 million held on coinex what does this all mean I believe that the mega Trump token is used by the big whales to dump on retail they've got more tokens than are even liquid on the market and we see how the number of whales is declining very constantly over time and at the same time we see how it's still the largest of the market cap so maybe the centralized exchanges got the allocation early and maybe they're also selling that would then also explain why the mega Trump token quote unquote only went up by 60 something per in the last week while the mega head token more than doubled I have made a very similar analysis looking at the exact same numbers for Mega head as well and we don't see that dumping by the whales over there and at the same time I do believe that the upside potential is larger for Mega hat again because the market cap is smaller but I publish

the non-playable coin is doing very well in this meme coin rally let's have a look at some onchain metrics most people aren't considering let's see who's buying and selling here because obviously we are not going to gain any edge with the website information we want to look at information most people do not have access to but there's one interesting thing about the website I'm personally using not VPN and I get a security warning before entering the website now since listing on market cap the price went up by more than 9,000 per. with 0.3 cents per NPC we are close to all-time high now let's have a look at the onchain metrix both for the ethereum base token but also for the token listed on the base chain let's first try to find out whether or not there is some manipulation in the data let's see if the numbers align on Twitter we've got 24,000 followers on telegram we've got 9,000 subscribers on the ethereum Chain we've got 11,000 holders and on the base chain we've got 48,000 holders now it's interesting about those 48,000 holders is that most of those wallets don't own a lot of NPC but more on this later we're going to look at minimum holding threshold and we're going to distinguish retail investors versus whale investors now the NPC token or non-playable coin is one of the most liquid tokens on the ethereum Chain so among the trending tokens it's at number eight in terms of liquid liquidity on the base chain however even though there are apparently way more holders we do not see NPC being part of the trending tokens now what's going on what I found interesting is that the recent growth of NPC mainly happened on ethereum not on base so have a look at this we are looking here at the number of holders based on different minimum holding thresholds so on the right side we've got the number of Wallets on ethereum that have at least 30,000 NPC tokens so at the current price PR that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token here are the videos that work on YouTube xrp will be $112,000 guaranteed or an AI explosion top three cryptos to buy in November a lot of pushing of greed that's what gets the clicks what doesn't get the click is a tutorial on how to make back tests on how to build those sheets that in the end figure out what historically worked well in the past the back test that I often show here on this channel I still very much enjoy producing using this kind of content though I also share these kinds of sheets but I don't do it on YouTube you also get direct access to me feel free to check it out it's the Bitcoin strategy.com for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right we got another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token we see accumulation across the board but it appears as if since April of this year the number of whales did somewhat stagnate now here are the exact same kind of charts but for the base chain here we see the stagnation happening a bit earlier right even among small retail and happening a bit earlier for medium-sized retail we can also see how the numbers tend to be smaller so the number of retail investors on base with a minimum of $1,000 worth the number of those wallets is 1,300 on ethereum that's 5,700 and that's happening while the number of holders on ethereum in general tend to be only 1/4 of the number of holders on base so there seem to be many many very small holders on the base chain of NPC the vast majority of capital though is on the etherium Chain now in the last month the price went up by More than 70% who drove that price rally let's have a look at the exact same charts this time for ethereum but only for the last month so every data point here is now 1 hour not one day and we can see very nice very constant accumulation by retail the number of retail investors grew by roughly 10 % the number of medium-sized retail investors grew by roughly 7% the number of Wales is pretty much unchanged so we can attribute all of this price appreciation to the retail investor not the retail investor on base but the retail investor on ethereum and it almost appears as if that growth is accelerating and so here's what I think is going to happen since a lot of trading is still happening on chain and since the token isn't yet massively traded in a centralized manner there's only XC and gate.io and since the Perpetual Futures Trading volume is also rather small still and since a fully diluted market cap is still just at 240 million combining all of those factors I think it's pretty likely that the centralized exchanges are going to accumulate the token for Market making because of all of that retail interest this growth is attractive to centralized exchanges and so yes there might be some volatility every now and then and we might see our quite massive crashes right those are 50 % corrections but zooming out the r seems pretty healthy to me yes there is potentially some kind of resistance here but that's on the US dollar denominator chart and again most of NPC's liquidity is directly paired with rep ethereum so looking at the same chart denominated in rep ethereum we are actually at an all-time high this is how that looks like on a linear scale so the continued accumulation by retail does have a price impact I'm covering meme coins on this channel regularly if it's

almost 30% in the last 7 Days the question is does it make sense to buy this dip now let's have a look at some onchain analytics let's try to figure out how much longer this crash potentially could last or if it makes sense now to take opportunity of those low prices now here are the leading trending tokens on ethereum ordered by their liquidity pool size and SPX 6,900 is at number five with 10 million worth of liquidity a market cap of 650 million and so we are currently at roughly 70 cents we are down slightly today but this week we are down 27% as so many meme coins are yet in the last month if you were early you made more than a 3X and in the last year it was almost a 50x now this is not the first video on SPX 6900 on this channel I published several videos in the past and yes you're right my thumb na game is not necessarily the best in crypto but the reason why I talk about this is I want to share some YouTube statistics so the very first video on SX 6900 on this channel was published on the 30th of September that video though did not get that many views it even got a few dislikes subsequently the follow-up videos got more views the recent video is still relatively fresh and has to do some catchup and so have a look at this the first video performed pretty average so that video is here in blue the average video is in Gray the follow-up video however outperformed and so that's the dilemma with YouTube right when I publish a video on a cryptocurrency that's not yet that well known and the video doesn't perform that well either when then at some point the price appreciates and the attention appreciates and then potentially the upside isn't that much there anymore that's then when the video outperforms and that's probably why a lot of tokens that you see on YouTube aren't necessarily the best buys the algorithm is simply working against us so if you want to get those videos very early feel free to subscribe potentially even hit the notification right if I make a video on a cryptocurrency you've never heard before maybe it might be worth watching because check this out the first video on SPX 6900 was when the price was still at 11 cents and after that we went up by 800% roughly the subsequent videos when then the price doesn't do that well anymore of course it did get more YouTube views now I believe that crypto is currently splitting in two direction we've got on the one hand the very serious Bitcoin investor the people that simply buy Bitcoin spot that believe in Bitcoin being the hardest money some people also buy via the ETF then there are the other investors the more speculative money that want to get the 10x maybe 100x returns those are the people that buy the meme coins now the issue with that split is that the middle pretty much gets decimated so the large D5 protocols they all underperform Bitcoin the very large meme coins also don't tend to to do that well have a look at this table which shows only meme coins and they are ordered by their market cap every single of those meme coins lost in the last week however when we look at the meme coins that performed rather well last week all of them have small market caps so we've got 50 million over here 50 million over here 40 over here we do have some meme coins that have a few hundred million market cap but it's definitely not in the billions and SPX 6900 unfortunately is also over here it's already got 7 100 million so 0.7 billion it's unlikely that it's going to make a 10x from here and rival Sheba enu I'd go so far to say that it's even unlikely that we'll see a 3X from here at least relative to the rest of the memec coin Market because that would put SPX 6900 even above Bonk now on this channel I like to look at onchain metrics I like to look at who's currently buying and selling where is currently the momentum shifting so let's have a look at that data on ether scan we've got more than 20,000 holders now not all of those holders are created equal let's have a look at the people that actually move the price what we've got over here is a wallet count based on minimum holding thresholds on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 tokens in the middle 10,000 tokens on the right 100,000 tokens now 1,000 SPX 6900 tokens is equal to exactly $700 at the current price in the middle we've got a minimum holding of exactly $7,000 on the right a minimum holding of $70,000 now we see how the rally that started in September of this year was mainly driven by small retail the number of small retail investors almost forx the number of whale investors only grew by maybe 20% or so now in the last month we still 3x in the price here's the same kind of charts with the same thresholds but cut off only for the last month we again see how retail buys how this buying is now somewhat slowing down we see how mediumsized holders also buy but here the buying is slowing down even more and the whales they rather tend to hold maybe slightly even sell now let's have a look at the pace of retail holder growth let's assume that the growth continues compared to what we've seen in the last two weeks so we are slowing down obviously let's say we stay at the current level then we are growing by roughly 10% within 2 weeks or 20% per month that's still quite fast a lot of meme coins don't have those numbers the current drop is obviously driven by the General market but we can also see that returning users are taking some profit so the number of returning users is higher than number of you users per day we can see that on average 60 to 70% of trading volume is generated by returning users not by new users entering the token now it's nice to see that the number of retail investors is growing it's also nice to see that especially recently the number of buyers outpaces the number of sellers so when we see the price going down it's just because some whales take profit but just have a look at this in the last few days we pretty much every day saw 60% buyers versus maybe 40 % sellers a real shift towards buying and so I will buy some SPX 6900 after publishing of this video as well I don't hold any right now but I will buy some after this video several hours after publishing I never buy a token before publishing a video so I don't pump and dump on this audience I don't buy secretly to then afterwards publish to then sell when you are buying I always buy after publishing because I don't like that conflict of interest now there's one more data point that makes me very optimistic about SP x6900 and that's the influencers they are buying now as well so in the premium membership of this channel the link is down below the Bitcoin st.com we're tracking various influencers and have a look at this Kyle chesse bought regularly into SPX 6900 across the rubikon also just recently bought again we track in total 12 wallets by Kyle chesse he's got more than 100,000 subscribers we also tracking Alex Becka with more than 1.4 million subscribers we've got 12 of his wallets not all of them are wellknown we also tracking Crypt Benta 1.1 million subscribers 33 of their wallets are tracked in premium and so besides just onchain analytics besides looking at the aggregated data looking at what the Insiders are doing and looking at the top Traders does make a lot of sense we got a lot of very nice signals very early on and so I even made a dedicated tutorial course just on that topic how can we find different influencer wallets how can we then track them and how can we then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking so that's eight dedicated tutorial videos just on the wallet tracking topic but in total there's more than 100 tutorial videos also on portfolio Management on blockchain analytics not just on wallet tracking once we've got a trading signal we of course discuss them in dedicated groups they're also part of the premium Telegram and of course I share my own trades as well for example I'm shorting ethereum relative to bitcoin and I publish videos regularly on how I see the market as a whole so feel free to check it out it's currently 125 per month there's also a onee money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% I like the retail holder growth of SPX 6900 I'm going to buy some tokens if you got some value out of this video feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this a like it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium

is going down most altcoins are going down but kaspa is doing pretty well let's have a look at some data most people aren't considering let's look at onchain data let's look at long-term toomics let's also look at the recent news why Kasa is going up today so right now we are at a bit under 18 cents the price went up by 11% today it increased by 20% this week anded more than 7x this year the reason for the price increase today is in Announcement by Marathon digital 9 hours ago they tweeted that they've been actively Mining kaspa and Marathon digital is the largest of the crypto miners by market cap which very likely means that other crypto miners are also going to jump on this will'll build dedicated Hardware just for kaspa and that of course gives the whole project more legitimacy but let's zoom out a little bit more let's have a look at the long term on this channel I've already published several videos on kaspa and the video published 9 month ago discusses a lot of fundamentals usage statistics token inflation Etc feel free to check it out kaspa many things to like but it was one of the better performing videos on this channel so have a look at this this is the blue line that's the performance of that video in Gray is a typical video and so I talked about K when the price was still at 4 cents again now we are above 17 cents so if this is your first time researching about kaspa maybe consider following channels like this I try to be early and I do publish videos fairly regularly now on this channel I try to be as objective as possible I don't just randomly sh cryptocurrencies I try to look at both the pros but also the cons let's have a look at some cons for Kasper one thing I don't like is the onchain usage statistics so this comes from Casper litics tocom this is the number of transactions over time the chart starts in October of 2023 and we don't really see much growth here unfortunately here's the number of unique sending addresses also unfortunately not really any clear growth same is true for the number of unique receiving addresses or the average number of transactions per accepting block so it doesn't seem like there is a vast influx of onchain usage right kaspa is its own blockchain or rather block deck right it's the improved version of a blockchain there isn't that much usage of the kaspa technology so far because unfortunately there isn't any smart contract capability you can pretty much only send Casper tokens from one wallet to the next the kaspa team is targeting to launch Smart contract capabilities but that hasn't yet happened the momentum around kaspa though is super super impressive what we've got behind me here is not a kaspa chart what we're seeing here is a long-term Bitcoin chart right on a logarithmic scale starting in 2010 and kaspa is very often compared with Bitcoin because it's also proof of work because it's also fairly distributed right with a fair launch all the tokens went to the minus and so this is the long-term Bitcoin chart now this here is the long-term kaspa chart a specific kaspa chart it's kaspa relative to ethereum there are very very few altcoins that have such a nice chart this as well is a logarithmic scale so each time we go up by roughly this distance here we double in the price so the kaspa price has doubled several times it continues to double and of course every now and then we have our crashes similar to bitcoin but this is a very very nice long-term chart according to this chart we've got a potential risk of losing 25% roughly versus ethereum but a potential gain of almost 3 Xing from here there are a lot of comparables also in terms of tokenomics this here behind me is the inflation rate of Bitcoin over time so we all know how the Bitcoin Supply gets cut in half every four years and we are currently at 0.85% per enm of additional Bitcoin hitting the market through the minus here's the same kind of chart for kaspa the reduction here happens every month it doesn't happen every four years so it's a smoother line that's then how the supply develops over time so instead of looking at the newly issued tokens at every point in time we look at the total Supply and at the point of recording of this video 84% of all of kaspa is already circulating there isn't that much inflation anymore at least in terms of percentages there is a bit of a problem though but more on this later let's have a look at the inflation in the next 12 months so it's currently June of 2024 let's have a look at the total Supply in June of 2025 that's 26.7 billion and the Supply right now is 23.6 billion so one year from now we will have roughly 10.3% more Supply the market cap of kaspa right now is 5 billion so in order for the price to stay stable we need to have at least $500 million of purchasing in the next 12 months every day 1.3 $1.4 million has to flow into kaspa now there's many ways to buy the KAS token right again kaspa is its own blockchain so most people will simply just use centralized exchanges there is a reped version though that can be bought on the ethereum Chain so on ethereum you have KAS to be bought on Unis Swap and the liquidity pool is almost 2 million in size so there is some liquidity here the nice thing about ethereum based tokens is that we can actually do quite nice onchain analytics have a look at this this is the number of holders over time for the ethereum based wrapped K token on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 10,000 k at the current price that's roughly $1,800 that's what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail it's another 10x from the left so that's now1 18,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's $180,000 all cohorts are increasing their Holdings over time that is good but let's see how much buying pressure there really is maybe starting from beginning of the year where we had roughly 700 holders to today roughly 900 a Delta of 200 new holders that have at least $1,800 in the token that's 360k worth of purchases we've got 10 times the amount over here in the middle but we also only have 30 to 40 wallets that increased over here so maybe that's another 500k or so and for the fun of it let's also double this here on the right so maybe in total on the ethereum Chain we got roughly a million dollar worth of purchases of KAS again since beginning of the year so that would be roughly 2 million of purchases over the span of one year but as said we need at least 500 million for the price to be stable now the big question is how much of purchases happen on ethereum versus on the centralized exchanges this is incredibly hard to answer because unfortunately the decentralized exchanges aren't even listed here most trading volume happens in Black boxes in gate.io and in mexc and in bybit qoin on top of that we've also got some leverage through Perpetual Futures through binance and bybit again Mexi and so that makes it very hard to estimate how much of this purchasing is actually natural versus potentially inflated or manipulated we can definitely say that momentum is positive we can definitely say that people are buying and the long-term relative valuation chart to ethereum is very very pretty and the token inflation with 10% per enom relatively speaking isn't that bad the only question is since the market cap is already 5 billion 10% of that is 500 million and that Supply expansion needs to be absorbed by all kinds of purchasers so of course by retail but also by the larger institutional players casine isolation looks quite nice the problem is that all of crypto doesn't look that great right now this is the stable coin market cap over time it's either Contracting or expanding this here by the way was the Tera Luna collapse so this is when the anchor protocol failed money afterwards was flowing out of crypto that then turned around in October of last year but since April of this year we barely see any more expansion unfortunately and we have seen what happens when there's no expansion for a while right D5 protocol could blow up if history was to repeat itself oneon-one again then we would see such an implosion in July 10th of July of this year I doubt that this will happen but still I prefer to be in a market that expands when the market isn't expanding it's 100% player versus player right you need to make better calls than the average Trader and most people don't make better calls especially when you've got a diversified portfolio right there's very few alt coins that did well in the last month and so fundamentally I personally approach the market differently at the moment I don't try to find the one or two winners that might do well Kasper could be among those winners but what I rather do is I try to bet on falling prices since the majority of altcoins is likely going to underperform in a market that's not expanding why not simply just bet on the Hast deck instead of trying to find the needle in the Hast deck right the one winner among all of those losers so I personally I am shorting alt coins right now and I like to short alt coins that have a very quickly expanding Supply that expand quicker in Supply than kaspa this is one of the alt coins that I'm shorting this is again a relative performance this time to ethereum and I'm currently making money as this chart continues to go down since beginning of the year this went down by roughly 50% and so this channel has a premium membership where I talk about how to short altcoins where I've got tutorials how to use web 3 to short altcoins but also disclose what altcoin this specifically is to Short so I ran the numbers if you've got roughly $3,000 in the short then premium is 100% for free so you need to have a few th000 in order to make this worthwhile if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough there's also a free telegram feel free to check it

I'm going to give the actual information 100% accurately technically we'll talk about I don't have any preconceived notion in my head it'll go up it'll come down no what's in the chart let's start from the Fresh what happened it was fluctuating it was extremely bullish I want to give an example right now peper man classic example we we we all have an idea you have an idea about peper man that what happened in the past last two years that's this this is the this is the one token which pumped last two years Pepe is one of the most pumped token in the world it was an accumulation phase price pumped the most in the world same goes with clb it was an accummulation it's pumping a lot but then then then there is this one thing which comes into play we have seen double top 15 cents if you want to take a trade in this token man clv buy after breakout after breakout take a trade but if you are buying now if you are buying now you're going to lose everything in the market I can write it down in a piece of paper Frankly Speaking you will lose everything 100% money you will lose why because you are gambling with your money people who bought earlier they lost money people who are buying now they will lose money because see how many ways do we have in the market to make money we have two ways to make money in the market either buy at the day if I draw a horizontal R either buy at 30 cents if it'll be back to this level 30 cents take a trade over here at the bottom that's how you're going to make money in the market but buying the dip the other way we have after breaking out once price breaks 15 cents once price breaks 15 cents closing above it 0.16 take a trade over here either buy after breakout or buy the bottom that that's how you're going to make money in the market people who bought the top at 14 at 12 and people who are buying now they will lose because once they have lost money and people who are buying it they will lose because it'll be trying and if it and if you don't see if it don't break it'll be back I want to like remove this one to explain you clearly man clearly guys this is how crypto works so we are oh here it'll be going to it'll be breaking it'll be trying to break if it if it can break closing above it it'll be massive okay that's one of the scenario but if it don't if it don't break then it'll be back eventually so so so so that's why man whenever you take a trade play professionally either buy after breakout after confirmation 10 out of 10 times you're going to make money but this thing what I'm explaining you this will come with time where you are trusting yourself and you are thinking that you don't want to lose money and then make money people who are buying now they are keeping this thing in their head they want to make money but what if it goes against you you will lose everything did you think about that no I did not uh you will lose you deserve to lose money because you are lacking knowledge when you buy after breakout $0.16 good to go or maybe it'll be back to 3 cents good to go both ways you're going to paint money in the market oh before we de dive into this token price prediction I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which want to buy today I have a VIP when I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I give a coin that Buy ad 0.3 was our buying price since we bought what happened if I remove Pepe also we have bought and we are sitting at 7x profit Ada 3x profit your $110,000 you could have turned $330,000 by now haven't joined the VIP on the screen you can see my whats number DM me I'll be adding you into my VIP when to buy when to sell complete guidance crypto alerts if you are using coin base binance this group is for you why because all the information there's one coin which launched in the market USU did we buy if I so I give an update us us UL launched when to buy when to sell we'll let you know don't bu the top okay what happened price dropped it's dropping it was was at 38 I said that don't buy I'll let you know when to buy when to sell professionally we take trade we make money you name a coin which pumped in the world even xrp or maybe any coin we always buy the dip that's how we make money in the market xrp Pepe bong shba Dodge you name a coin man you name a coin it had 5 Z 341 bro it pumped a lot Dodge it pumped we are sitting at 7x profit in Pepe Dodge did we buy bro you name a coin I'm saying and I'll show you we have taken a trade at the bottom always always at the bottom that's how you're going to make money in the market and this thing like I have been doing for 10 years now so you need experience man you must be in the market for a decade for 5 years at least to have an idea I wish you all the best price prediction we have for clb that's approximately $10 $10 will come into the picture once we see price breaks $1 for short for long-term $10 us110 yes my friend you heard it right man after breakout it'll be massive 0.16 take a trade okay let's talk about few fundamental part about this token which really makes an impact in the market clva open over here it's a big one man indeed we all have an idea I have talked about this token earlier as well $93 million of market cap extremely low 159 like twice the market cap that's a real 1 billion coins we have in the market everything is top notch man it's a substrat okx venture portfolio BNB chain part of oh my God it's a really big binance coinbase okx c you name a platform it's available everywhere in the world it will be massive man price prediction for this bull market over $10 for shortterm man that's for sure for for bull market possibly $20 for bull market for shortterm $10 bare minimum bare minimum that the least I can think of $10 I wish you all the best have a nice day Che guys",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfB9fC3Dljs,"['BNB', 'XRP', 'Pepe', 'WHY',

dying and we can see this in data that you don't have any access to I am seeing how attention on not is going down and if declined attention of course the price has to follow as well now there's something very interesting happening the ton blockchain is actually defying All Odds the ton blockchain sees continued adoption yet not coin the leading meme coin on ton isn't doing great so had you invested into knot 1 month ago you'd now be down more than 50% we're currently at 10 cents per knot the fully diluted market cap is at a bit over a billion Bitcoin didn't do too well in that last month either it went down by 20% but still right - 50% versus - 20% that's quite a stark difference now let me show you that data regarding attention on not I published four videos on the token on this channel the very first video was published more than a month ago and it got almost 35,000 views another video a few days afterwards followed that got 14,000 views and see how those numbers are declining here's the next video that one only got 9,000 views and the very recent video published a bit over a week ago only got 2,600 it was a below average video it's now starting to climb again with the NCoin crash but yeah I published one of those videos things don't add up for notco coin the market cap was way way larger compared to adoption metrics as in onchain on the ton blockchain we didn't see that many transfers in other words a lot of the price action was probably influenced by the centralized exchanges but I'm not going to repeat the content of those prayer videos feel free to check them out I want to focus on something else what we've got over here is the not coin price relative to the ethereum price so now we try to remove the up and downs of the general crypto market and we look at the idiosyncratic movements of NCoin and initially we had a massive selloff due to the airdrop then we've seen quite a bit of recovery but since the 2nd of June of this year so for a bit over a month we've seen a pretty constant underperformance and that underperformance happens in a somewhat predictable downtrend we are neither very high nor very low within that downtrend and this development is interesting because at the same time we see how the ton blockchain continues to see adoption and that's happening Despite All Odds we've now got a total value locked on the ton blockchain of almost 700 million and when we look at the top blockchains ordered by total value locked ton is at number 11 and ton is one of the only blockchains that actually saw an increase in its total value locked in the last month pretty much all other blockchains saw Capital flowing out isn't that fascinating ton itself is doing phenomenally well but the main meme coin on ton is not doing great I believe this has something to do with the General market trying to drisk let's have a look at ton relative to ethereum so again we are trying to isolate the idiosyncratic movements by dividing by the ethereum price and yes in general we have seen a nice long-term upwards Trend but again things tend to get somewhat into dangerous territory right as in Risk versus reward it's not necessarily super attractive in this current market and with the current market I of course mainly mean this over here this is the stable coin market cap it's the sum of D and tether and usdc and bu USD combined this is not expanding since the end of April of this year so more than two months of zero inflows into the stable coins there's no more Fiat getting deposit ited in some on those centralized exchanges on top of that we see that Bitcoin has crossed the 120-day simple moving average I have made a back test trying to find the best moving average for Bitcoin the best historically is the 120 day I made a separate video on this feel free to just check the recent video on bitcoin on this channel I'm explaining how this all works I tested all moving averages between 2 days to 200 days the 120 day tends to predict price is the best as in when the price Falls below that moving average we tend to turn bearish and so we have lost momentum in Bitcoin 2 weeks ago and that then in my opinion explains why everything is red and that also explains why people de risk with not coin I am a fan of putting the odds in our favor not trying to pick the needle and the hay stack the one asset that might do well I like to rather bet on most Assets Now underperforming it's 100% player versus player no new money is getting into crypto and so when most assets are likely going to underperform because returns are concentrated in just a few players if in general the market tends to not do so well why not simply just bet on that why not just short everything here is one asset that I'm shorting I'm not sharing what asset that is here on YouTube but in premium you can find it out here's another asset that I'm shorting again we are looking for assets that don't have a lot of volatility and that tend to decline relatively constantly so if you've got a crypto portfolio $5,000 or more feel free to check it out I do believe that premium pays for itself if you simply just short basic tokens that have high token inflation or that have a lot of Supply hitting the market when no money is flowing into crypto and when there's no attention on most assets then why not take advantage of that I believe it's easier actually to make money in a bare Market than it is in the bull market in the bull market we have to find the few winners in a bare Market we can simply just short everything and right now it seems to be pretty obvious that we are starting a bare Market I've exited very close to the Top Again feel free to check out the prior Bitcoin video I'm sharing premium videos from that time when I sold and so I believe strongly in the power of onchain analytics and in the power of back test it's at least how I personally generated my Alpha in the past and I believe those approaches will continue to work in the future if your portfolio isn't yet large enough to justify premium there's also a free telegram the link is as well down below looking very much forward to check with you over there as well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTeYVtvNc-U,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'USDC', 'Notcoin', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTeYVtvNc-U/hqdefault.jpg,2024-07-06T09:52:55Z

token we have in the world we are just one breakout away from uh reaching the top if you draw the graph uh if you check the graph in forour time frame and draw okay from here draw a trend line to explain you man it Formed double top the most various flag uh this is one of the highlights so we need like one closing above it which will not happen at the moment but if you see if you see closing Above This level if we see closing Above This price going to pump non stop fine but we have bigger um like time frame as well one time frame when we check the gra previously from this level that was 83 84 it dropped and today itself got the rejection man that's why it's coming down if I draw a horizontal Ray to explain you man see this how beautifully it played out it tried breaking it tried breaking but could not break how it it was 100% perfect so how we should it got the rejection why it got the rejection purely because previously it tried one a time frame previously it tried man previously it tried breaking this level could not break so it dropped massively today itself it tried now it need closing now it'll be back it's coming down it it's coming down it'll be fluctuating after that again going to try and once we see closing like this after that price is going to break no if you don't see closing closing man it'll be trying again after after like after some hours if it don't break it'll be back again and then again it going to try again it going to try like this but once we see closing like this closing Above This level above 83 when to buy PR take a trade at 86 cents nobody in the world will resist you hold you that don't buy no people will say that buy good to go after 83 Cent 85 886 good to go buy and make the most money out of it it's one of the final but before that before breakout if you are taking a trade nobody taught you the basics you are new guy who want to buy I I'll I'll buy I going to put the money I going to make money in the market no way you will lose you are a loser Man without knowledge without experience you are buying something and you think money will like follow you no of course not once you will make money with your luck twice you will make money with your luck third time once it goes against you you'll like lose all of your profits which you made with luck and then you will be losing money as well and then you will have that regret oh I want to recover my money then you will have that and then when you will come in that uh loophole of loss loss loss loss you are dead man then you will be taking wrong trades again and again I don't want any of that to happen man uh in all my videos anyone who watched my content they have made money in the market why because we play professionally before we Deep dive into PR fundamentally technically price prediction everything I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market or do you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I have been doing crypto for 10 years now I have a VIP two trades daily signals daily profit we bought ra Y 0.17 what what happened since we bought this token Ray r a y since we bought Ray today it hit the to $5 your $1,000 you could have turned into literally $330,000 in profit that's why I say best in the world why because Bitcoin Bitcoin we bought 3 years back from now BTC 19,000 nobody was talking about Bitcoin we we took a trade in Bitcoin we are sitting in like 3x sorry 4X Prof in Bitcoin as well anyone who watched my content who joined the VIP VIP thing is a really big huge man haven't joined the VIP on the screen DM me I'll be adding you all the information about crypto daily signals Buy price sell price complete guidance on my VIP right now let's come back to top how we should go after after breakout man after breakout B 85 Cent is good to that's the only buying level we have or else we have to buy less than 30 cents if I remove this level you can take a trade over here at 85 that's the first level or or or maybe if it won't break it'll be back to 30 cents and less than that but it going to break just wait for some time it going to break we are in a bull market now it already made the new alltime high Bitcoin so yeah let's talk about few fundamental part of this token which really makes an impact in the market PR o because it's a big one man Prosper just a bit of it $24 million of market cap volume is like fourth time the market cap that's that's a real 34 million coins we have in the market extremely low Dow yeah binance g ixe almost available everywhere in the world I wish you all the best price prediction we have for prosper for short term it going to pump up to $10 and for

recovering it's up today it's up this week and the big question is how much longer can this really last let's have a look at some onchain data most people aren't considering let's have a look at toomics as well we're currently at a bit under 6 cents up almost 9% today 30% this week but since launch we pretty much went sideways what's going on now this is not the first video on a TI on this channel I published one exactly 3 months ago and the video performed quite well in Gray is an average video in blue is the AER video which shows that there is interest in the token so if you're interested in the fundamentals and if you're wondering about token allocation Etc feel free to check that out Simply search for why AER is up now some fundamentals have changed since release of that video for example we've now got the AIA etge launched before there was only a weight list with more than 100,000 participants now the a edge can directly be purchased for 1.3k and it's another mechanism to mine the a token now I'm always interested in what the smart money is doing right the of this world they're simply just buying because something might be hyped at the time but if the people with millions and millions of dollars accumulate a token that's potentially positive now on chain we can count the number of Wales and that's this graph over here what we're seeing here is the number number of wallets that have roughly $100,000 worth of 8e at current prices and this tends to rise quite consistently over time within those 3 months the number of whales roughly doubled but again the price didn't double and it was not because retail was selling retail was purchasing as well now one might think that the reason for 8s lackluster performance in US dollars is a General market and this might be partially true because have a look at this chart this is 8 relative to ethereum so we're dividing now the 8 price by the E price and this is going somewhat sideways right since launch we are up slightly by 15% but that's still way less compared to the growth of the number of Wales over that time period so could it be that dpin cryptos and GPU mining cryptos in general didn't perform well let's have a look at the competitors so a tier is competing directly with render it's a very similar business model this is 88 relative to render this outperformed by 30% but again less than the 100% we're looking for here's AER relative to Akash a very similar chart a very similar growth as well 10% and it's interesting how a tends to trade in somewhat of a range relative to aash we could go up by 25% we could go down by 25% this is a pretty narrow trading range now when we look at Renda and Akash and we check their relative valuation to E eum they actually did quite well especially since beginning of the year or maybe Q3 of 2023 render outperformed ethereum by 600% aash during the same time period also outperformed ethereum also by roughly 600% and if you've watched the prior videos on ath year on this channel you probably know why the price is comparatively depressed it's token unlocks its toomics the supply of atth is growing quite quickly over time and if demand can't grow as quickly that potentially causes underperformance so here's the number of atth tokens over time we're currently at 3.2 billion and a lot of Supply will get unlocked to advisers and to Checkers and compute providers in other words people that buy Hardware like this now AIA is riding on the back of a massive wave this wave over here this is the wave of AI and of GPU what we seeing is the price of Nvidia stock over time now the big question is how realistic are the current prices still are we in a bubble because if we zoom out a lot and we check the NASDAQ 100 so us technology stocks over time we had two major Corrections we had the.com crisis and we had the global financial crisis what we see over here the vertical line this is when Bitcoin launched so Bitcoin really has never seen any significant correction the com crisis was a correction of more than 80% and un unfortunately there are some scary numbers if you compare the situation back in the days to today at one point Cisco was the largest market cap in the NASDAQ 100 it had a valuation of half a trillion while the US money supply was roughly 4.6 trillion so Cisco as a single company was worth as much as 12% of all circulating US Dollars now if you compare this to today nvidia's market cap is 2.9 trillion money supply is 21 trillion that's 14% of all of money supply so relatively speaking Nvidia is even more hyped is even more expensive today than Cisco was back in the days and again we got a more than 80% correction in technology stocks at the time will this happen again your guess is as good as mine but I don't think that Nvidia can do another 3 four five x from here relative to monetary expansion and money only expands by 6.8% per enm over the decades so the air is getting thin and the big question is will AIA be traded as a derivative of Nvidia is it simply just riding the wave or is there enough idiosyncratic movements if Nvidia was to crash then the atth token is probably not going to do too well either let's zoom out even further let's have a look at how much money is flowing into crypto is there currently a crypto expansion is money flowing from from the Fiat system into crypto or do we see outflows because more money in general of course means more risk- taking means of course higher prices in the last 30 days we saw the stable coin market cap going down slightly by 0.4% so net there was redemptions from stable coins into Fiat there were outflows this is how that looks like on a chart we had our teral Luna collapse which then started off a bare Market we then saw the turn around in October of this year which by the way is also when all of those AI tokens tended to outperform so this is render this is Akash and now since April of this year this has pretty much halted there's no outflows there's no inflows we are mainly going sideways and since crypto is still a risk on asset if there's no money flowing in prices tend to rather go downwards so Bitcoin dominance tends to rise stablecoin dominance tends to rise and the crypto market cap as a whole tends to decline again since April March of this year the crypto market cap as a whole went down by 25% the alt coins did even worse this is the others dominance so how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that went down by another 25% so not only did Bitcoin get weaker the altcoins lost even more and so I'm personally rather cautious especially with higher market cap altcoins like a year with 2.4 billion if there is a lot of token inflation it needs a lot of more Capital to keep the price up I personally prefer altcoins with smaller market caps where just a bit of money can move the price quite a lot where we've got more idiosyncratic movements the overall picture of all of crypto looks not too great and so we have to find a few winners that can outperform with not too much inflows for example one week ago I made a video on drift and that's up 43% since release of that video and because the price is picking up the video starts to get some views as well I tried to be very early on this channel and always buy after I publish a video so I waited roughly 24 hours after publishing the drift video before buying because I don't like this conflict of interest right I don't like YouTubers that chill tokens that they've already purchased if you don't want to miss what I'm buying next

now let's see if this week long rally is finally turning around and if you're going to see a dump or if long-term adoption actually continues let's have a look at the onchain metrics most people are not considering now here's the price action in the last few days we are down from the top of almost $1 to now 63 cents a loss of 33% this might sound like a lot but in the grand scheme of things this could be a start of something potentially much worse because that 33% decline is this little blip over here in this longer term chart we have seen SPX 6900 going down by 95% now it's interesting to see that today the number of buyers is way larger than the number of sellers but still the buying volume is not equaling the selling volume thus we are down by 7% so it seems like a case of the Wales and of the early buyers now taking profit now the onchain analytics are a bit more complex because there are three versions of the token there's one on ethereum this is where most capital is with 16,000 holders but there's also a version on the base chain with 14,000 holders and of course the casino on Solana is running as well there we've got 18,000 holders now this is not the first video of SPX 6900 on this channel I covered it actually very early so the first video was published 2 weeks ago at a time when the price was 11 cents and even after that correct we are up almost 6X now here's what's interesting about YouTube when you talk about a token that's not yet popular but might become popular in the future the views are actually not that great so as said I published several videos on SPX 6900 and the first video with the lowest price it tended to be initially an underperformer nobody was interested the last video though where the price was much higher was an outperformer and so that's unfortunately how the algorithm works right it spreads whatever is popular but whatever is popular tends to be also high in price so if you don't want to miss the next video when I talk about something early feel free to subscribe I publish videos on various meme coins regularly on this channel now let's dive into the current metrics of SPX 6900 and let's start with the ethereum chain on the left side we've got the number of wallets that have 1,000 SPX 6900 tokens at the current price that's roughly $600 we go a 10x for the middle chart that's $6,000 for the right the minimum holding is $60,000 so there's $7,500 small r Wallets on ethereum there's only 800 such Wallets on base and there's 4,800 such Wallets on Solana so it looks like we can pretty much ignore the numbers on base price Discovery definitely doesn't happen here now let's compare the price development in the last month with the holder development in the last month because initially we had our very beautiful rally but then we're turning around since the 13th of October now here's the last month on ethereum with the number of holders so now we don't look at the all time time charts we only look at the last month and so the number of small retail holders continues to grow despite the price retracing medium-sized retail so all the wallets with at least $6,000 at current prices also continues to grow if we then go another order of magnitude up though so $60,000 this is where we see the turnaround now that turnaround did not happen on the 13th of October it already happened around the 7th 8th and 9th of October this is where accumulation some what stalled and then the selling started happening on the 10th 11th and 12ths and so have a look at this again right since the 10th of October the price action is getting a bit more choppy and so if the whales continue to sell we probably continue to see heightened volatility now there's one Central metrics that's especially important for meme coins and that's new investors are there actually new people coming into the token and this is potentially also accelerating because the more new people jump onto a project the higher the price can sustainably go now here's that data again we're looking at ethereum and we see the number of new users per day and this peaked on the 12th of October since then is coming down and we have to ignore the last data point here on the 17th of October because the day hasn't yet finished so again that's the data on Eve and here's the same data on Solana pretty much the same picture the peak is happening somewhere around the 9th maybe 12th of October on the left side is the user count on the right side is a transaction count the transaction count peaked on the 12th of October now we can also compare the firsttime traders to the recurring Traders and a clear flip has happened after the number of firsttime Traders peaked so now we see the existing Traders battling against one another not so many new Traders coming in and I believe that the whales know about things like this that's why they're exiting crypto is a game of both luck and skill and the people that have better data the people that are better informed they tend to make the money right they tend to beat the market and so I like to look at what the people are doing that have most money that tended to make the best calls in the past and they're clearly not accumulating as quickly as they used to so yes the number of buyers tends to grow now relative to the number of sellers this by the way is again on Solana and yes in the last weeks the price of course could rise with that heightened trading volume but still just the number of buyers exceeding the number of sellers does not necessarily help when the whales on average have more than 100 times more holding than the retail investor right we've seen this at the beginning of this video the number of buyers exceeds the number of sellers but the buying volume does not exceed the selling volume so the sellers simply have more money and so on the left we've got the token balance by holder size small and medium retail is getting more of the overall token Supply or in other words the whales are selling the small guys are buying and that selling pressure is pretty significant so the whale Holdings went from 60 million worth of value all the way down to 42 million while the value for small retail barely changed because they continue to buy and so there's the hope of some people that there will be more centralized exchange listings but I'm not sure if that's going to happen if the whales continue to sell the token is listed on mexc but the trading volume isn't actually that large price Discovery really happens directly on chain on radium for Solana and on Unis swap for ethereum that's where all the trading volume is and so this YouTube channel has a premium Community as well and we talk about all kinds of all coins and of course that also includes SPX 6900 a shout out to guok and Tokyo tracks who are very active in onair analytics in the channels here's aosst of some onchain data on October 13th where shared that SPX is likely going to Peak and so our members have taken profit again the 13th of October was over here was the perfect timing and so feel free to learn onine analytics yourselves there's all kinds of different tutorials in premium there's a whole course just dedicated to finding other wallets but there also videos on micro indicators on portfolio management Etc hundreds of videos now to improve your crypto game of course you use those onchain Antics not only to time the market we also use it to monitor other successful Traders and so have a look at all of those SPX trades made by Kyle chesse in the early days we've got 12 of its wallets monitored always giving us an alert whenever he buys and sells and of course all the graphs all the statistics that you have seen in this video are part of a tool set of Premium as well well so there's a tool for the ethereum based blockchains there another tool for Solana and of course also a tutorial video on how to use all of this there's even videos on how to build tools like this yourself now to sum it all up I don't have a crystal about either where SPX is going the only thing I can say is that the whales are actively dumping they are selling their tokens and that does depress the price our members are taking profit and are looking for the next opportunity I believe that's the right thing to do if you got something out this video feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and of course looking forward to seeing you on premium as well

up let's have a look at what's driving all of this who's buying here who's selling here let's look at the onchain metrics most people aren't considering now this is not the first video on Simon's Cat on this channel I published one 54 days ago and it outperformed the average video by quite a bit so an average video is here in Gray Simon's Cat is over here in blue and there's a reason for that performance now at the time of publishing of that video the price was at 424 now we are at 437 so initially we went up by almost 90% then we came back down now we are up since publishing of that video by 52% and so that's the idea of this channel right I try to discuss tokens that are just in the process of growing if you want to be early next time feel free to subscribe now let's have a look at what's causing that rise and subsequent fall and now very quick again let's actually check out what happened to those more than 230,000 holders because not all holders are created equal now for the chart on the left we look at the number of wallets that have at least 30 million Simon Cat tokens and at the current price that's worth $1,112 that's what I'd consider retail that still can move the price somewhat among those $232,000 holders only 3,717 wallets actually hold that amount in other words more than 98% of holders have less than $1,000 worth of cat now in the middle we go another 10x in minimum holding so that's now at least $111,000 roughly on the right another 10x so that's now $110,000 worth of the token we see two waves of accumulation and it seems like the second wave where the number of retail investors grew by roughly 50% was much more prominent among the small holders compared to the larger Wales right the number of Wales only grew by roughly 10% so that second wave stopped on the 11th of September and interestingly enough the price movements don't really mirror that adoption right we saw all those new wallets but we don't really see how the price is pumping massively and then potentially staying flat right it's rather than profit taking isn't it fascinating how the number of wallets isn't really correlated with the price now let's zoom in a little bit let's have a look at just what happened in the last month the price in aggregate went down by 11% but we did see a pump just recently now here's the number of holders with the same holding thresholds just for the last month so we are basically zooming in from those top charts to just look at the last month and we don't see that much growth of small retail or mediumsized retail or Wales we rather see the tendency of profit taking again the price chart would suggest that there's some kind of clear Trend the first two weeks of this month went down by pretty much 50% but the number of holders didn't really changed that much can we find out what happened with this second pump was it a lot of new investors buying into the token maybe because of some kind of marketing campaign or was this returning traders that maybe bought more here's why onair data is so useful we can get an answer to that question what we've got on the left is the number of returning users in Orange and the number of new users in purple and it seems like on that 21st of October a lot of returning users traded the token again it was not new users wallets that touched cat before also bought over here I personally prefer to see rather the opposite right I want to see a growing investor base the more people come into a token the higher the price can sustainably go currently it seems like the holder growth isn't really that strong it seems like this pump is also not created by new joiners but by the existing Traders and so that would suggest that maybe at some point those existing Traders could be selling again on the right we see pretty much the same data as on the left the only difference is that it's normalized to 100% consider of looking at the number of Traders we just look at the percent of new users versus returning users can we get a hint of what's going on by looking at individual wallets do we see potentially how influencers are manipulating the price let's have a look at the wallets that we are tracking we track more than 400 influencer wallets so we've got two interesting messages over here influencer just poock received catch tokens so that's 1.5 million tokens and James RN received 3 million tokens and then subsequently 17 million tokens that was in the middle of may now receiving is not the same as buying right it could be simply the team sending tokens to influencers to then ask them to promote the token but it could also be moves from centralized exchanges right when influencer buys a token on a centralized exchange and then afterwards sends it for Cold Storage to their wallet usually though it's simply the team especially when a project is in its very early stages the team simply tries to find ways to get the word out and so here's Tyler hill we track his wallets and here are the two wallets that we Track by James win in total we have 433 wallets now and it's always interesting what's going on for example here ky chesse he bought ndx for 0.023 we are discussing the signal over here but I'm not sharing this publicly on YouTube and the price is at alltime highs we are now at 0.247 cents up another 5% in that last hour so this seems to be something interesting liquidity of only 440k I'm going to buy some of this as well so this is what crypto is all about right it's about being early it's about buying together with the smart money it's not about buying when it's already promoted on YouTube it's about buying when nobody else knows yet about a token when still the market cap is very small and so I invite you to join premium as well there is a 7day money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply message me within the first s days and then I find you 100% no questions asked the link is down below it's the bitcoin.com and besides all those trading signals there's also plenty of tutorials one complete course just on wallet tracking how to set up Bots how to find influencer wallets Etc and of course we've also got the usual we've got dedicated Chats on individual altcoins where we can then discuss when to buy and when to sell so to sum it all up with the Simon catch token I believe that price Discovery does not happen 100% organically it seems like currently the holder growth is pretty much flat I'm not really sure if it makes sense to buy this pump because it is mainly caused by the whales it's mainly caused by the people that already own the token it's not new people coming in and you want to have a growing investor base over time for the price to continue Rising if it's your first time here Fe Fe

which is now at an all-time high above 80k the question is how much longer can this rally and Dogecoin last let's have a look at some onchain metrics let's try to figure out who's actually currently moving the price so what we've got over here is Bitcoin Bitcoin is at new all-time highs it's also of course above the 120 day simple moving average that's the moving average that historically worked the best for Bitcoin when we run the back test number and so we are off to the races I'm in the market with leverage right now I took advantage of this R very very nicely but of course Bitcoin is nothing compared to the Dogecoin rally in the last 7 Days an appreciation of 90% And in the last month an appreciation of almost 160% and the reason why this is so impressive is again the market cap Dogecoin is huge for Dogecoin to double in market cap a lot of millions have to flow into the asset do coin has a market cap of 43 billion right now it outperformed pretty much any other meme coin in the last seven days only Nero was able to catch up but Nero has only a market cap of 1 billion so 14th of Dogecoin now we have to take the onchain analytics that we're going to look at with a grain of salt because most trading volume actually doesn't happen on chain most trading volume happens through the centralized exchanges through the bances and okx Etc of this World those centralized exchanges are black boxes we can't really look into them we don't really know if it's small retail that's currently buying if it's the whales that are buying we don't know here have a look at this here's the trading volume of Dogecoin in the last 24 hours dominated by binance with 15% then follows okx and gate.io and on top of that we've also got levered bets on the price in the form of Perpetual Futures 11 billion worth of Dogecoin moved hands through those contracts on binance alone in the last 24 hours and so what kind of onchain analytics can we actually do Dogecoin is its own chain so if you want to buy Doge outside of the chain and outside of the centralized exchanges we have to buy a ported version now the most liquid ported version is on the binance smart chain and so make sure you buy the right token don't follow for something that's got the same name the token address starts with 0x ba A2 and ends with 4 c43 and so on chain we've got more than 800,000 holders but of course not all of those holders are created equally right some of those wallets might just have a few cents of the token while other wallets might hold Millions so let's look into the data in a bit more detail let's segregate those different wallets by their holding this is something I do regularly on this channel and what we see over here are long-term charts they start in April of 2021 and on the left side we see the number of Wallets on the binance M chain that have at least 3,000 dogecoins at the current price of 28 cents that's roughly $900 or so worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so that's now $9,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right another 10x so $90,000 we can see how small retail pretty much stopped accumulating Doge in May of this year we can also see something similar for medium-sized retail we can see how the Wales they tend to even now reduce in numbers when we just look at the last month the number of Wales on chain on the binance smart chain went from 290 to 270 so a reduction of 10% again while the price went up by 158% now among the larger cap cryptocurrencies Dogecoin is probably one of the most volatile ones thus timing the market is very critical and so we do see some interesting data again through the onchan Analytics here is a very useful chart we see the number of buyers and sellers over time so on the left side that's the count and on the right side that's normalized to 100% now what is so interesting here let's have a look at two data points recently where the number of buyers outpaced the number of sellers massively several days in a row so we had more than 80% buyers only 10 to 20% sellers what happened during those two different points in time so let's first look at the 15th of October 2023 that was over here it was just before we saw a nice rally in Dogecoin of 70% now let's have a look at the beginning of February 2024 that's over here again just before we saw a massive rally in Dogecoin of 130% maybe even 180% and so unfortunately we don't see that imbalance right now otherwise it would be a clear buying signal right now it seems like Dogecoin could be somewhat heated and I say this because of two things number one is that the Dogecoin dominance so the fraction of all of crypto that's currently in doge is spiking up quite a bit and in the past we have seen those spikes and subsequent deflation the second problem is that trading volume is pretty high and there is some correlation quite strong correlation actually for Dogecoin between the attention the trading volume and the price and all of those things are high of course we tend to afterwards Trend down and so again let me show you what I mean most people just look at do coin with this chart which is just Dogecoin in US dollars but the problem is that here we've got the influence of all of crypto as well right when Bitcoin goes up and ethereum goes up and of course Dogecoin goes up as well thus I like to look at relative valuations and what we have got over here is the Dogecoin dominance how much of all of crypto is Dogecoin that's currently at 1.55% and we did see very similar Ries in the past and subsequently Dogecoin underperformed the rest of crypto by more than 50 % I'm not saying that history will 100% repeat itself I'm just saying that this is not necessarily that pretty of a chart now secondly we've got the trading volume that's here at the bottom and just have a look at when this spiked we also tended to spike in the price we've seen this in November 2022 we've also seen this in March of 2024 so yes we can see a secondary rally but even those kind of drops this is not insignificant this is 24% down and again we are currently very very high in terms of attention the Trump win for the election and the support by Elon Musk that still plays around with the Doge name of course can generate quite a bit of attention right he calls his new department where he wants to increase efficiency in the government the department of government efficiency in other words do Doge but yeah the question is how long can this attention last I think it's rather risky to buy Doge now among all cryptocurrencies across all chains Dogecoin is already at number six it's got almost half the market cap of Solana that sees billions of trading volume every day I believe most gains are to be made in the small meme coins it's about figuring out meme coins that will gain attention in the future and where it doesn't need that much money to move the price because when we look at the meme coins that outperformed the best in the last 7 Days their market caps aren't that high the best one had less than 100 million in market cap the second best is of course Dogecoin related as well but again if the original Dogecoin goes down then probably this derivative won't do that great either I have a look at this fcoin I made a video on fcoin several weeks ago as well I also purchased it I announced this in the premium membership here and the point is that the real outperformers tend to be in the lower market caps it's not necessarily in the sixth largest of all of the cryptocurrencies doubling some something again that's already 41 billion in market cap is really not that easy and so here's what I personally do I look at different wallets I track wallets I try to figure out what kind of influencer owns what kind of wallet and whenever those kinds of wallets make transactions I look at those transactions and I vet them and I tend to buy with the influencer because what very often happens is that influencer buys a small meme coin for example and then afterwards after they purchase they then announce this on Twitter they then announce this on YouTube and then the price tends to shoot up quite a bit and so have a look at this for example Crypt bter bought the peanut token that was on the 3rd of November for 3 cents peanut is now absolutely Going Bonkers 140% in the last 24 hours it's up now 800% since Crypt Benta bought and so this is the Crypt Benta channel it's got 1.1 million subscribers and we've got 33 of their wallets we track in total more than 400 wallets and so people are making money I just recently sent a welcome video to a new Joiner he's following the different wallet notifications and it's already paying off no surprise here there's an entire course on wallet tracking there are eight videos just on how to find influencer wallets how to track them how to then afterwards interpret the signals there's more than a 100 tutorial videos in total also on onchan analytics the things that we looked at in this video also on risk management on portfolio diversification Etc we are also disc ing the individual altcoins when to buy when to sell in dedicated Chets and so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month the link is down below the bitcoin.com there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see simply just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% And so I think it's already too late for Dogecoin I think the upside potential isn't really there anymore we can't necessarily double and triple from here that easily I think the real chances are now in the smaller altcoins and if you got some value all this video feel free to subscribe I publish youly like would be very much appreciated as well helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lR01UAvbbg,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'Flow',

from this more than 26% loss in the last 7 Days let's have a look at the onchain metrix and try to figure out is this potentially an opportunity to buy the dip because with onchain data with the data that most people aren't looking at we get an advantage over the people that just draw random lines on price charts we want to know the things most people are ignoring So currently we are at a bit under 1 cents the price went down by more than 26% in the last week now why are we even bothering with book of meme why are we even bothering with the B token the answer is in this table book of meme is still the second largest cryptocurrency on the Solana chain with a liquidity of 53 million it's only below slur it's larger than anything else on chain and it's not just large on chain it's also been traded on centralized exchanges quite a lot this is pretty un common either we see a lot of trading on chain in the early days and then a lot of the volume moves over to the centralized exchanges or alternatively we see already the launch at the centralized exchange and we never have that much on chain for Book of meme we see trading on both sides it's very interesting and the trading doesn't just happen on the spot market so on binance htx and gate.io it also happens on the Perpetual Futures market so people are actually betting with leverage and derivatives on the book of meme price and that's mainly on binance now here's a mistake that a lot of people make a lot of people simply just look at the US dollar price valuation but the problem is that alt coins are very much also impacted by the underlying ecosystem token right when Solana goes down by 50% then book of meme is also likely going to go down to a similar degree if not even more and so in my opinion it's a mistake to look at this chart the book of meme to US dollar chart because simply looking at this it's also not obvious why the price turned around at the levels but when we look at the book of meme relative to Solana chart we see those supports way more clearly and currently we are again very close to such a support and what's the potential upside if you just look at this price chart if you don't yet look at the onchain metrix which will follow in a second the potential upside relative to so is easily 40% if not even a bit more so here's the trading volume on chain on the Solana chain directly not on the centralized exchanges and this is segmented by what size a ton of activity in the early days not so much right now let's have a look at what fraction of Wales large retail and small retail mediumsized retail currently dictates the recent price action that's in this chart over here so I simply just normalize the trading volume to 100% look at the share of trading volume based on different segments small retail is wallets that have less than $1,000 worth of the token mediumsized retail is up to 10,000 large retail is up to 100,000 and Wales is everything above 100,000 now we notice how small retail tended to grow over time but how in the last two days it was mainly medium-sized retail that's dominating everything so it's the wallets between a th000 and $10,000 that are currently buying book of Meme and I interpret this as a positive sign because this is how crypto goes right crypto is both a game of skill and luck and the more you play the game the more you trade the more tokens get ated to the people with more skill right the luck component balances itself out thus if more and more tokens are currently been traded by the larger wallets I see this as a good sign smart money is getting in so attention is super low medium-sized retail is buying relative to Solana in the price chart we are very close to a support and so if crypto as a whole can expand right if new money flows into crypto again which unfortunately we haven't seen that much in the last 6 weeks but if we see a turnaround again if we see an expansion of crypto again then I believe book of meme can likely outperform I already made two videos on book of meme on this channel one published two months ago another one published 2 weeks ago and I will continue to make updates in the future if you're interested in those updates feel free to subscribe again I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram feel free to join us

longterm, Simon Cat Tokenomics,  #cat #memecoin #crypto","crypto is crashing and especially the meme coins are crashing does it make sense to buy this dip does it make sense to buy Simon Cat one of the leading meme coins on the binance smart chain let's have a look at some onchain metrics let's have a look at the data most people aren't considering now what we see over here is the others dominance so this shows how much of all of crypto is in the altcoins that's not in the top 10 and we can see this continuously declining since beginning of the year and here is to a degree the reverse of that chart this is Bitcoin dominance so Bitcoin becomes a more and more important factor of all of crypto now why is this all happening the answer is the Bitcoin ETF have a look at this chart this is the daily inant outflows out of the Bitcoin ETFs and initially we have seen quite a lot of outflows from the grayscale Bitcoin trust now this has changed recently we don't see those outflows anymore thus all the inflows we into those new instruments are 100% net positive this is what's currently supporting the Bitcoin price it's purchases by Wall Street its purchases through the ETF and so let's get back to Simon's Cat which is not doing that well recently it's down 26% this week alone and yes this year we almost doubled but under quite a bit of pain we ried and crashed we ried yet again we crashed yet again is this a potential Bu The Dip opportunity let's try try to find this out by looking directly on chain on the binance smart chain where Simon skat is mainly traded who is currently buying is the number of holders increasing for small retail or for the Wales now here is how important the token actually is among the trending tokens on the binance smart chain and the binance smart chain is the third largest of the chains it's the second largest token with a liquidity of almost 15 million and so the long-term chart looks pretty promising right it looks like there is upside potential of 72% roughly and the comparisons in terms of market cap are also promising it's got a market cap of 174 million and it could potentially double right there's still a lot of other meme coins that are double the size baby Dogecoin is on the binance marchain as well book of meme Goos maximos turbo Etc so according to BSC scan we've almost a quarter of a million holders on chain now not all of those holders purchased the token right there was an airdrop and so then the question is who's actually holding substantial amounts of the token here's a statistic I like to look at pretty much with any video on this channel and that's the number of small investors versus large investors on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 40 million cat tokens at the current price that's worth roughly $11,000 for the chart in the middle we go a 10x so that's roughly $10,000 worth of the token for the chart on the right it's roughly $100,000 worth of the token again minimum holding so among the 243,000 holders less than 1% has more than $11,000 in it and so we can see this is not necessarily growing over time we can also see how this is not necessarily fluctuating that much over time how do we see crashes like this of 50% regularly when the number of holders isn't really fluctuating that much I've got an explanation but before we talk about this I want to share my YouTube analytics on prior Simon Cat videos so there was a video published 66 days ago and it outperformed the average video quite a bit then there was another video published 13 days ago that tends to perform pretty much with the average so maybe there is some kind of decline in attention now attention is correlated with price right it makes sense to buy a token when nobody is looking it makes sense to sell a token when everybody is looking but here's I think what's causing all of that volatility and that's influenced by the centralized exchanges have a look at the Perpetual Futures Market that's dominated by binance but okx and buybit are also part of the party if you don't see the holder graphs fluctuating that much what we see over here is simply just the last month then those massive price crashes can only be explained by the mega Wales selling right by potentially the centralized exchanges and so I'm personally not buying Simon's Cat I prefer tokens that have organic long-term growth on chain as well in the premium membership of this channel we have they tracking more than 400 wallets and I have not seen a single wallet a single influencer or a single top Trader trading cat I've only seen James win receiving some cat but those were cat tokens on ethereum it was not the B&B token so for example we've got 12 of Alex Becker's wallet and he's got 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube or we tracking 33 of Crypt bent's wallets and they've got 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube when we see the those kinds of wallets buying something it might make sense to buy as well right very often influencers buy a token to then afterwards talk about it on YouTube and when then all the YouTube viewers buy the token afterwards the price tends to really rally however when we've got a token that's mainly manipulated by the centralized exchanges that's not traded by any influencers and that doesn't really see any accumulation on chain either then even though the chart might look interesting the only driver for an appreciation would be yet again manipulation and so the more people buy this dip the more the price could potentially crash right this is what the centralized exchangers want to do they want to make money as well and so they position themselves exactly opposite of what most other people are doing and so I rather keep buying the tokens that those large players those large influencers and top Traders are buying there are also dedicated tutorial videos in premium on how to find those wallets and how to track them so there's an entire course in premium eight videos in total on how to find different influencer Wallets on how to track them and on how to then afterwards interpret the signals that we get from the tracking there's more than 100 tutorial videos in total not just about wallet tracking but also about portfolio management risk management bet sizing Etc feel free to check it out of course there are also dedicated chat groups for the individual altcoins feel free to check it out there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like what you see just message me within the first week and I'll refund you 100% so I personally stay away from Simon's Cat I think especially in an environment where bitcoin's dominance is rising we have to be very very picky with what altcoins to buy it's a 100% player versus player game if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vH4K1GePd8,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Dogecoin', 'Turbo', 'JUST', 'WHY']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vH4K1GePd8/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-04T12:27:49Z

token is a direct competitor to render and to aash so we're looking at decentralized GPU Computing let's have a look at tokenomics let's have a look at the beers let's have a look at how much longer this price could potentially R so here we are we are at almost 9 cents up almost 40% today very shortly after launch and I'm not going to run you just through the website and sell you the marketing Jazz this is an objective Channel I'm not just going to shill you hoping to buy the coin and dump on you because here are the reasons why most people argue that you should be buying aier a year has 20 times the GPU power of the render Network and 45 times the computing power of Akash render is currently valued at roughly 5 billion Akash at 1.3 billion and AIA has currently a fully diluted market cap of 3.7 billion note there's only 9% floating here this is a first hint towards toomics the supply of the 8 each token will more than 10x at some point so demand has to grow at least at the same pace for the price just to stay stable that does not mean that the price has to crash now though because we have seen very similar projects in the past and they initially ried quite a bit but more on this later so things in general look very healthy the Twitter account has almost a million followers so 875,000 followers on Twitter and of course a lot of that excitement comes from the GPU Demand right Nvidia is currently doing very very well and so people are looking for the next best thing that might potentially have a levered effect on GPU demand so if the gains of Nvidia stock isn't enough for you then maybe a year is an option but let's have a look at the demand and Supply Dynamics because that's in the end what determines supplies right it's the intersection between supply and demand so eighth year is decentralized GPU power and the early adopters were able to buy a note a checker note that sale has ended though prior to selling those notes a year raised 32 million in funds there's more information on Ico drops who those investors are and most of those investors already made a pretty nice return here's the average Roi and so here's the thing right when there is support by Venture Capital that's potentially good to build out the project but it also means that those vure capitalists might be selling their tokens at some point depressing the price so again demand has to grow as quickly as tokens unlock let's have a look at tokenomics let's have a look at the unlocks so here we've got the token distribution of a year we've got our airdrop we've got the investor allocation we've got half of the tokens going to Checker nodes and compute providers more on this later 15% to ecosystem 5% to advisers 12.5% to the team how will this hit the market the team has to wait 18 months there's another airdrop 8 months from now where the supply will double another 8 months from now where the supply compared to today will triple the Development Fund is already very vesting linearly over 24 months the treasury is vesting as well the investors are going to dump in 12 months and the Checker notes and Edge notes are also contributing in the next four years so what does this mean this means of course an expanding Supply and what can potentially stop the depression of the price when the supply increases its demand may be for the computing power its demand maybe for the notes that have to potentially be bought with the token and what happens when you have to buy a note with a token that in the end paids out the rewards in the same token we've got something that resembles Pony nomics right I'm not saying this in a judgmental way there is ways to make money with Ponzi schemes but in case we've got these kind of pony nomics going on here you need to find an exit point at some point so don't hold this forever more on this later when we compare this to another very similar crypto project so let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's have a look at how many people are currently holding the at H token there's two versions of the token one on ethereum one on arbitrum the ethereum token is still the main version at the moment there's 35,000 holders but only 1,600 holders have more than $1,000 worth of the coin 200 wallets have more than $10,000 worth of the coin and 47 holders have more than $100,000 worth of the coin we are still very early this is not a lot of holders yet will there be any dilution because of listings on other centralized exchanges maybe there is no listing yet on binance on on coinbase and when the listing gets announced of course we will see a short-term price hike so far the main centralized exchanges are okx gate.io bybit and htx now here's a parallel I'd like to draw and that parallel is to a crypto project called helium helium built a decentralized Wi-Fi infrastructure so you bought a helium Noe you had to buy this with real cash and then that note paid out h&t tokens over time the initial purchases of the note pushed up the h&t price but then when the rewards were paid out and not a lot of people used the infrastructure then the h&t price gradually went down so there was not enough demand for usage of this wi-fi infrastructure and with a lack of demand for the infrastructure there wasn't enough demand for h&t thus the price depressed when Supply increased now let's have a look at how long the party lasted so again let's check out this chart this was a pretty long ride for almost one year and you could make massive money with the this at the top though the market cap was at 5 billion the situation with ath year is slightly different we are already at 3.5 billion this needs to go to 1 million or March buyers now will make millions this is how you get the clicks on YouTube but this is not how you beat the market to beat the market in crypto you need to be better informed than the rest you need to be better skilled than the rest you need to do better blockchain analytics you need to track other people's wallets and know what is the Smart money doing it's the the boring educational content that forms skill that doesn't perform so well on YouTube though that's why I created the premium membership feel free to check it out we are tracking influencer wallets to find out what they are buying before promoting this on YouTube we've got a lot of tutorials to help with onchain analytics to help with wallet Discovery and of course there are also plenty of chats where we help each other and also one-on-one conversations with me so I'm messaging every premium member oneon-one directly once you're joining you will get a message message from me and you have the opportunity to directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the Bitcoin trade.com link is down below and the big question is what could be the next demand driver for the atth token and maybe that's the new note let's have a look there's not just the E year Checker there's now the eigh year Edge as well and there's almost 150,000 people that have already signed up to get that aier edge and it might make sense to have a look at how quickly this number is growing but the fact that this number is even shown here that should indicate that the team is pretty much aware that a lot of people that buy in know that this is to a degree a player versus player game right this is to a degree a redistribution game I'm not going to say the p word again but you know exactly what I mean I do believe that this project has some potential to go further up at least medium-term there's simply so much money behind this right there can be a lot of promotion that could be done but I wouldn't buy the atth token to hold it over the next four or five years I do believe that at some point it's likely that the toomics will catch up so this is to a degree in my opinion like playing with fire make sure that you have your eyes on a potential exit point at some point if you get in don't just buy the hype have a very clear look at how quickly is the community growing how many new tokens enter the market and then make a judgment call at what point in time the supply will grow faster than the demand if this is your first time feel free to subscribe I will continue to make updates on a year on the Channel as well feel free to also give this a like it will help the channel grow if you've got telegram then you are more than welcome to join us the link is down below looking very much forward to seeing you in telegram cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rnm_0J4p6Q,"['Bitcoin',

latest news and developments in technology behind crypto and block chains first please do not forget to subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter the protocol on coindesk.com let's dive right into it our first story we're talking about ethereum developers create dn44 tokens after ERC 404s send Network fees surging okay that is just a lot of stuff that probably a lot of people have zero idea what any of that is even like regular you know crypto people don't even all this stuff was just invented two weeks ago but anyway um Sam what do you think of why don't you tell us about this story yeah like you said this is this is new um so ERC 404 um is this new token standard developed by this protocol um nft protocol Pandora essentially what it is is it's just like a fungible nft which sounds kind of um like a sort of misnomer um or or an oxymoron rather um what is a fungible non-f fungible token what they do is they combine fungible tokens um just like a regular cryptocurrency with a non-f funable token so that you can for example trade um fractions of NFS have the nft burned in your wallet and then to the person who you've traded the fraction to um if they get enough of this fraction they can mint a new version of the nft in their wallet um that's kind of like a vague way of explaining it but that's at a high level what this concept is and there's like all this controversy around it that our um great colleague Dan um wrote about so um we can get into all that um Margo you follow the ethereum world so maybe you've got some sense of you know what the response has been up until now yeah what you were sort of getting at was that this is not ERC 404 is not an official standard um that it's sort of been like created and marketed with that framing ERC stands for ethereum request for comment usually when you get these standards you go through like a process and it gets approved by the community and by the devs and this is not the case for ERC 404 it's just called ERC 404 it's not an actual uh legitimate standard um and so it's been interesting sort of to see The Fallout in The Wider like ethereum ecosystem as this protocol has sort of surged um you know to the front lines of the new news I guess but at the same time I've like noticed from the devs like they haven't said that much about it um but I don't know what do do you do you guys have any takes on on this whole controversy around ERC 404 I mean in general the idea seems smart and useful of a way of fractionalizing these nfts I mean some of them are you know they can be quite expensive right I mean and and you know I mean an nft can be any anything right I mean nft could be a Super Bowl ticket you know um but uh you know and then you have a Super Bowl ticket that's whatever like you know 120 Grand fractionalize that you know where you're only gonna toss in a thousand bucks but you're basically going to speculate on the you know cost of a Super Bowl ticket but I don't know like that's you know or a piece of Fine Art where you have you know like 5% of it but it seems like there's lots of different ways people have tried to do the this is just kind of the latest is that the way you all think about it maybe one thing um that I didn't do a good job of is kind of like explaining how this works and why it's you know cool I I I I mean essentially just very simply again what happens is rather than just being able to own one nft um which is you know the way things work now um and it has problems uh namely uh most notably with liquidity like if I want to buy an nft only one person has it um you know where am I going to get that N I can buy nfts that are in a collection s but it's just price Discovery all these things are hard what this does is it says Hey an nft can be broken down so if you own a whole nft say it's like a 100 tokens if you own all a hundred of them um you have that nft um if you sell one of those hundred tokens it goes down to 999 you have 99% of the nft that's actually not a a concept so you don't have 99% you have none of the nft what it does is it burns that nft in your wallet um and then if you send those 99 tokens to somebody who has one and they have a hole now they have 100 it mints a new nft for them so it's actually not the same nft before it's a new minted version but in the context of something Brad you give the example of like tickets that actually makes a lot of sense say you don't have a ticket that is worthless but if you're able to scrap together um you know enough pieces of a ticket now you have a whole non-fungible T token you have a ticket that's really cool and also there's like a bunch of trading applications on top of it that could you know just with liquidity in general like people love to speculate this app opens new avenues for speculation so it is like a kind of cool idea but again uh this this whole thing that Margot was talking about around how they didn't go through the formal process to propose this I is why uh part of you probably the entire reason of why we're talking about it today was it false advertising what if this thing's broken people think it's legitimate they start using this and they realize they don't have their tickets um that's that's the problem um it's not as audited as you might hope yeah I I think it's interesting you bring up the trading perspective because you know when I came into into uh this podcast or this recording I have sort of rolled my eyes at this like why is this actually needed um and you know there's so many problems on ethereum like this is what we're dealing with um but you know I guess that that that that does kind of make sense in a um like a narrow scope I wonder though if this is just like another hype cycle like how how persistent is this also because like like you said this is this is not something that's been officially approved we don't know what the security risks are behind this we hasn't been properly audited like people I guess crypto is risky but this is very risky in my opinion and so so you know this it's it's another one of those interesting stories to follow especially the Fallout from this but you know I guess with everything in crypto these days is is this really needed is my sort of my take on all that and the fun Strat newsletter I was just reading that this morning they were they were just saying that what we're actually seeing is just another meme coin sure incarn ation and but I mean I think it is important to point out here Sam I don't know if you I don't remember if you pointed this out but that it it is causing some congestion right like the the frenzy is real enough that it's being se you can witness it in like a a rise in the gas fees right yeah that's the other piece of this story that I did neglect to mention which is that gasv on ethereum are rising to you know record levels at least as far as recent history is concerned all on you know or or largely on account of this new trend um is it a meme is it all hype probably everything has been meeme and hype up until now um basically in crypto and on ethereum defi but broadly there has been this defi Resurgence that we've seen on ethereum which I'm I think we'll get into later as we talk about air drops um but this also might be kind of a part of that the appetite is there again for these sort of like speculative things which for D5 broadly if not this token standard might be viewed as a some something of a positive but I think you're right Margo like what is the use case for this you know in it this particular technological innovation I don't know if it has legs or it's just a step towards something else right but all right well let's move on um to our next topic okay Satoshi era Bitcoin function opcat dusted off as development feror grows so you know this is just more on the ongoing theme of building on bitcoin right I mean people are suddenly excited about the possibility of you know some of the the stuff on bitcoin that we've seen on ethereum and some of the other you know alt ones and layer 2os and some of the other ecosystems and this is actually I mean Jamie Crawley wrote this story and he did a really good job of kind of figuring it out but there's some history here which is this opcat function was actually included I think on the Bitcoin core software or I don't think it was called Bitcoin core software at that point it was just the Bitcoin software uh you know very early days you know the network launched the Bitcoin blockchain launched in 2009 and then 2010 Satoshi took it out because there were certain risks um and uh but now these some developers are saying let's bring it back because technology has apparently reduced some of those risks and this will enable uh the next wave of building on bitcoin um I don't know what do y'all think about this yeah I think it's great that you know that I I feel like we've been coming now almost weekly or maybe bi-weekly been talking about building on bitcoin and so it's great to sort of hear that there's this Resurgence um you know uh with modifying and uh updating the network yeah so this is interesting I mean I wonder though if you can kind of like help me understand having you know knowing very little which is a theme about Bitcoin um uh development um I I I wonder if you can you know explain what this um opcat thing actually is like what does this enable um for the network for developers well I probably shouldn't go at too much technical depth because I will quickly screw it up but what I will say is the the cat refers to the word concatenate and so basically they're putting two elements together and the idea was that would quickly you know get too much and it would not only uh result in exponential memory requirements but it would also expose the network to some sort of security risks an OP code is you have these on all blockchains essentially a blockchain can be thought of like an operating system and an OP code is just like at a very root level you know a a function that you can do on the Chain that's like when I say root level it's like addition subtraction in some cases exponentials multiplication you know some some more crazy things this is like concatenating things together and I I don't yeah I I guess the idea um for them I is that for for developers of Bitcoin relative to other things um other protocols the idea of something like this being a burden to the network might be more precient because Bitcoin has historically like we've alluded to in past episodes and today been much more reticent to expand on its core functionality because they don't want to make that big computer that operating system too heavy for the network to run they want to keep things as simple as possible I wonder um knowing like I said very little about this how much of this um concern around this opcat stuff which is apparently supposed to make things better for l2s Defi and so on on top of Bitcoin I wonder how much of that concern is born out of like a real genuine sense of anxiety around the chain getting bogged down and how much of it is just kind of a a more you know uh I guess fight ORF flight sort of a thing that you get with Bitcoin developers where they're just constitutionally incapable of you know adjusting the core programming um the the core rules of the ch do you have any sense of that for I mean I I I don't know if we would from talking to developers I think it gets at some of the core issues which is you know Bitcoin does not have kind of a leading organization it's it's it really is much more of this like open-source collaborative you know Spirit which means a lot of times things have to have consensus in order to get merged in and so that is kind of one of the perennial debates going on and how do you enable this building on bitcoin do you can you do it without changes to the code so there was a breakthrough Robin Linus's it's called bit VM um you know what the Breakthrough there was they could they could add some of this functionality without having to to get consensus you know um and then separately I was just reading this proposal yesterday um from in fact one of the authors uh is from botanics Labs which happens to be building like an evm compatible um Layer Two uh on bitcoin you know it's like a little proof of stake Network that sits on bitcoin anyway one of the developers works for that company um but they were in their you know proposal they talk about how some things work without those changes to the code you can build a layer two but it's a lot easier if you can get this change I guess you know because it just gives you a little more flexibility I don't know does that answer your question Sam yeah it does just become a question it almost feels like talking about government or something when you talk about Bitcoin ethereum to a lesser extent um to an almost non-existent extent on other changes chains like I'm sure you hear like slippery slope sort of arguments where it's like oh once we add you know this back I mean this should be something easy like it used to be in there and now you know machines are strong enough that we can actually you know nodes and clients are and so on are are strong enough that they can handle this like if you can't get this in um you know maybe that slippery slope is not something that you're going to go down Argo you have any thoughts on this yeah it sounded like this change like yes there are these security risks but it's sort of with the mind it's being brought back in with the mindset of it enables like this additional building like that this building on bitcoin is not stopping that there will be additional um changes maybe to the protocol I wonder specifically like high level like what is it that this change in code can enable in terms of building like what is that goal that they're heading towards I mean they gave some examples um layer 2os should be a little easier they talked about uh decentralized exchanges so I guess some of the defi stuffff mhm um there were a couple other examples in Jamie's story no I mean that's that's great it sounds like it's you know like we've talked about like MIM mimicking ethereum a little bit but you know we we we love to see it you know the ethereum foundation you know they take a long time to get these things through but more or less like if they say they want it it seems like it probably gets onto the road map whereas I kind of disagree with with the with the I mean the ethereum foundation is like holds it's definitely a Central Key component of the ethereum ecosystem um and you know a lot of the core devs are employed by the ethereum foundation um but I wouldn't say that the ethereum foundation is involved in um you know the road map and the direction or at least that's what they would say um and you people can debate it a little bit but it's not like a um key well key is the wrong word it's not a sitting like member of making these changes you know as an institution um but that is the difference between Bitcoin and ethereum is that you know ethereum the ethereum foundation is so uh vast in its um in what it touches in the ethereum ecos system whether it be grants whether it be you know employing cevs whether whether it be helping create these clients that we've talked about right um and Bitcoin doesn't have that anyway back to bitcoin that's that's in it's still still great to see that you know it's giving room for more of this growth yeah yeah I think it's all Spectrum too regarding what you're saying Margo like yeah you a lot like the history of this goes back to not a tech conversation um but a conversation around regulatory things and icos and so on and the reason why these foundations might want to distinguish themselves from core development I do think you're right though that in the case of ethereum at least if not relative to bitcoin relative to a lot of other ecosystems you do just by virtue of its like largess it's much larger than um other um you know comparable ecosystems they're able to have more people pitching in they're able to have you know more people with dueling incentives pitching in on the development of the of the chain Wares with Bitcoin when they're not actually doing that much that decentralization you know um means um a little bit more at least in the case of ethereum you see more people you know even centralized parties weighing in because you know they're actually making changes in a way that Bitcoin until recently you know doesn't yeah well all right let's uh let's let's wrap that one there uh let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about well variety of things airdrop season and also how it relates to what we're seeing on enan layer um it's going to be fun and complicated all right we'll be right back calling all developers score a consensus 2024 developer pass for just $19

welcome back we have our next topic actually I sort of teased it right before the break so Marg why don't you just kind of tell us what's the big idea that we're going to be talking about yeah airdrop season free money basically but um you know um Stark net is among the ones that are leading the airdrop season um with its big announcement that they much anticipated start token is going to become eligible to a variety of users in the in the Stark net ecosystem ethereum ecosystem and in the non web3 ecos like I guess I don't know if there's an ecosystem for that but basically non web3 users um are also going to be eligible so you know they they announced um I guess we're recording on a Wednesday they announced today uh that you know they're making 1.3 million wallets uh available for this token and it'll be aird dropped on the on the 20th and they and users have until June 20th to claim it so exciting stuff for for the you know much anticipated Stark token Margo let me ask you Stark net you know what is Stark net and why do they you know Stark's been operating right but why do they need a token now yeah so Stark's a layer two uh built on ethereum there is ZK you use you know ZK r at they use zero knowledge um but they have their own programming language called Cairo so it's not necessarily uh ZK evm um and so that because of that sort of barrier there's been a little bit more of a distance between um stet and other uh ZK rollups that are ZK evm like polygon like scroll scroll is new but but matter Labs I'm thinking of ZK sync um and so there's uh there hasn't been a Tok there hasn't been a token yet on Stark it has his own ecosystem there's a whole bunch of daps and uh you know exchanges and and just like a gaming I think is also pretty big on Stark net um and so now there's the Stark token that um the team the St well the announcement came from the starkware found Stark net foundation and the primary developer fir behind Stark net is the company called starkware um and so they've come out with this token that they say they're that is primarily going to be used for governance purposes and to participate in this Stark net ecosystem um but I thought it's really interesting because I I I I have I do speak a lot to the Stark net folks um and they're very uh much ethereum aligned is what they call it meaning they are pursuing their interests in the sake of for the sake of ethereum's interest um and so they've made this uh Stark net airdrop pretty big um to allow people like home like solo stakers um including people who uh you know stake with Lio and other liquid staking providers as well as um as develop veler or core developers from ethereum people who've you know been crucial to implementing some of the biggest code changes to make ethereum what it is today um as well as also these non web3 developers who develop in the sake of you know for the sake of Open Source um I so I think it's really interesting because this this airdrop is sort of getting at um not necessarily always what everyone is excited about about you know free money but also that it sort of has this like vision and this Mission and sort of to like give back to the core of uh their ecosystem which is ethereum it'll be interesting to see who claims their tokens and and uh whether you know ethereum developers I mean I think the reaction on Twitter so far has X I should say has been positive I've seen a lot of core eth like people um excited to see that you know they're being rewarded for their hard hard work in some sense um but yeah that's sort of what the takeaway from from this specific air drop has been yeah maybe to place this into a broader context too it's interesting to see like ethereum defi having a a big I say defi because we're talking about tokens I don't know starkware has defi on it but it's a layer to but anyway ethereum defi is kind of having this big airdrop moment it follows like um you know a similar moment on the salana blockchain that we talked about a while ago where a bunch of these protocols that people have used haven't used some haven't even heard of um are are rewarding people a ton of money um essentially what it equates to through these aird drops but you know um I'm I'm always a little bit um maybe to step back um and uh you know give the the more cynical take on on airdrop season what it's all about I mean there's a bunch of reasons why projects and I'm not talking about starware specifically there's a lot of projects that are launching tokens and a lot of different projects have different motivations and um tokenomics and and and so on and so forth but broadly an airdrop giving this quote unquote free money to people what it what often happens is you have these teams that have spent a bunch of time and resources building something now what they're doing is they're creating a Marketplace for their token ostensibly as a way to reward people also though um to create a new market for this token and to lure in new users but also as a way to reward um you know right rightly um you know their own contributions um so it'll go to investors it'll go to their own team members and so on and so forth and all of these different tokens are going to have very different distributions I mean this is basic stuff for anybody who's been following this ecosystem for a while the crypto ecosystem broadly but it always does bare mentioning when we're talking about airdrops like they're not all created equally you want to be really careful that you're not like dumped on and so on and so forth but one other thing that I'll say here is that we have seen the rise of this trend and we might talk about it in the future um points so the idea of a bunch of protocols that are kind of incenting users to come and join them um to deposit their money um so on and so forth for the prospect not of um necessarily interest but points um which are this kind of like Loosely defined metric that will be used to allocate future airdrops you're seeing this in the liquid restak landscape which we've talked about and we'll talk about more later but people are acre points that don't have any value so that they can later maybe get an airdrop that hasn't been you know confirmed yet for regulatory legal like lawyer reasons um it's all pretty interesting but it is incredibly speculative so this airdrop season you know has a lot of facet the Stark Wares the points the so on and so forth but that's also why we were going to make the connection to enan layer right is that people are piling into Igan layer because they might get the air drops from all these things that igen layer is gonna secure right yeah I mean that's like a tangible but also like you know you can be cynical about this but you can also be like realistic about this as like a mechanism to get people in where ien layer the reaking thing on ethereum where you can stake with them and then they'll help secure other networks and reward you extra interest the whole idea with igen lir which has attracted like6 billion dollar in deposits in just a few months since it started opening and closing deposits um it's attracted all this money like 1.5% of all ethereum according to defi llama all ether rather according to defi llama um the reason it's able to do this is because a bunch of platforms that have been built on top of it that are rewarding points on top of native igen layer points to people who deposit into igen layer through them but the whole point of Igan layer ultimately is going to be that it rewards interest people on top of their deposits but today those interests again are points because that extra interest that you know comes from core protocols and stuff without getting into the technology of it which we'll do on a later episode I'm sure and did on a previous episode it doesn't exist yet so the native like the it's all speculative um and so with airdrop season it's exciting but it's also kind of a signal that we're leading you know we're moving into these economies that are you know a little bit more precarious in their fundamental um you know structure starnet also Wormhole uh they announced their's their air drop is coming you know that'll be another big one but same kind of question like Wormhole has been operating why do they need a a token now and I I don't know I was just kind of thinking about this like part of it is because that's what they're supposed to do right like if that's a reasonable answer like they're kind you know the the criticism is these things are all centralized in some way you want to turn it over to the community that is kind of whether that is true that's sort of you know the Fig Leaf at least but but then you know there's all these people you know to your point Margot they want to get paid you know get paid that's yeah no and they're competing against you know I mean the money printer aspect of these things like the all these projects they have they print their own token it's like they have a money printer so why not use that every other competitors are using it so they might as well they kind of have to most of these tokens it should be noted also like we're talking about this on a podcast we all have American accents because we live here um we're not going to be able to claim these things I mean we're also journalists we're not claiming these things anyway probably um none of us um but you know like it's not available in the United States for a reason there's regulatory reasons in addition to these kind of like high flying like philosophical reasons why one might want to transition to Dow governance and it gets to the Hoy test it gets into all these other things but you know you're appealing to the community by transitioning to Dow governments but you're also looking at the government and saying hey we're not issuing a security we're actually transferring governance and we're releasing tokens that give you votes in this system it it's it it's you know it's about a lot more than rewarding the community um and you can be cynical or not about it but it's like good to be realistic and um yeah our job is journalist is going to be to figure out you know what the real Dows from the you know loosely you know creating markets that you can dump into again not talking about any specific projects here but anyway Margo any final thoughts here before we wrap yeah Sam nailed it I was going to bring up that you know we're US Citizens We're recording recording in the United States so US citizens you can't participate in the star care drop also if you happen to be on the ofac list which I hope you're not but you know if you are you're also not part of that list so uh you know Russia Iran China and the US and whoever else North Koreans here protocol podcast we accept all viewers let's just put it that way sure sure but your start all right uh thank you Margo and that is a wrap for this week thank you for listening to the

definitely standing out the wolf token almost 3x in the last week while the rest of the market didn't do much let's have a look at the onchain metric let's try to find out who's buying here who's selling here is this potentially a meme coin to buy at this time now what we are looking here at is the performance in the last week for the tokens with a market cap in the ranks between 300 and 400 so those are definitely not the largest tokens we are looking at tokens with upside potential and wolf seems to have besides upside potential also positive momentum this is then how that looks on the chart we up 50% today as said we are almost up 3x this week and we're up almost 500% this year of course not without drama we did see our pump and dump in between now I'm not going to walk you through the website because this is not how we can get an edge in the market right we want to look at data most people aren't looking at we want to know things most people don't thus we want to have an approach to time bottoms and tops properly now the main risk with meme coins is manipulation if there's only a few insiders that pump and dump the coin and we don't have really an edge what we want to see is long-term adoption by a lot of people we want to write the current wave because if there's more and more investors buying into mcoin that's potentially positive now let's search for hints of potential manipulation let's compare numbers on the Solana chain we've got 26,000 holders of w on Twitter or the xplatform we've got almost 700,000 followers now this is odd normally we don't see such a discrepancy why would there be almost 30 times as many followers on Twitter than holders on the most active chain now one possible explanation could be usage on chain so maybe we don't see all the holders on Solana maybe the holders are hidden somewhere in Black boxes in the gate iOS Etc of this world and yes this might be part of the reason most trading volume happens on bitet which is a centralized exchange however the decentralized exchanges are still very significant we still see a lot of trading volume on them if we add those two together we are at 38% of trading volume now there are many ways to analyze a token and one very crude way but potentially still valuable is to Simply look at the number of buyers versus Sellers and we don't need any advanced tooling to see what's going on have a look at this over here this is Dex screen.com and we can see the buying volume versus the selling volume in the last 24 hours so the price went up by 48% and we see that the buying volume was 206,000 while the selling volume was only 169,000 so there's a Delta of roughly $37,000 and because there's not a lot of liquidity on chain that Delta in buying versus selling can push up the price that much now what I like to look at is the buying volume relative to the number of buyers buers so what's interesting is that the buying volume is outpacing the selling volume but at the same time the number of buyers is much smaller than the number of sellers so we've got only 40% buyers but 54% of buying volume in other words the buyers that are buying are buying much more in terms of dollars than what the sellers are selling or to describe this in leman's terms it's the whales that buy a lot and it's a few small retail investors that might sell on the way up now let's get a bit more Advanced here is some data from a tool that I've developed myself that's by the way also available to the premium members link is down below you can plug in any Solana token into this tool and look at the exact same numbers what we see on the left is the number of firsttime traders in purple versus the number of recurring traders in Orange for any given day in the last 30 days and we see how this started to Peak on the 24th of October so that's over here when the rally started we see how the numbers are now declining somewhat but please ignore the last data point because because this day is not yet over the same happened for the number of token transactions it started peing on the 24th here's the trading volume by Trader segment so small retail are wallets below $11,000 worth of the token medium retail is up to 10,000 large retail is above 10,000 and so we've seen a lot of trading by small retail from the beginning of May up until the middle of August that's when the price went up quite a lot by 160% roughly we can also see see this in this chart over here right the trading volume was quite elevated and then it stopped and with the trading volume crash came subsequently the price Collapse by 70% and so on the right side we see the same data as on the left just normalized to 100% And so I find this data very fascinating because it seems like up until the middle of August it was a lot of small wallets that bought the token that traded the token and then the price also went up and once that stopped the price collapsed but actually I believe that that trading volume by all of those small wallets was not natural and here's why check out The Following over here this is the number of wallets that have at least 400,000 or 4 million or 40 million worth of the token now 400,000 tokens at the current price is roughly $500 worth of the token so this is $500 this is $55,000 this is $50,000 already since the middle of April those numbers tend to decline so it looks like this is just shuffling around of internal funds this is not natural do you really believe that there is more than 11,000 wallets that have $50,000 worth of the token and the total liquidity on chain is only half a million I don't think so how is it possible that so many small retail wallets traded the token and that that subsequently collapsed when at the same time the number of holders at $500 worth of the token continued to decline I believe some kind of wash trading algorithm was pushing up the price was trying to generate some attention and when that stopped working when the price didn't rise anymore despite that effort that's when they turned off the machines that's when wolfy was not trending anymore and that's then when the manipulators cashed out and so again the rally that we're seeing in the last 24 hours is definitely not natural we don't see the number of holders going up we probably see a lot of Bot accounts that got just generated and that now trade the token against one another that's of course somewhat of a pricey Endeavor right because $400,000 worth of trading volume minus the 0.2 maybe 0.4% decentralized exchange fees that's still several th000 in fees to generate that attention but sometimes a token that relies even because of manipulation can generate enough of that attention to get more people on so that's why sometimes mem coins have this flywheel effect right everything else is r but the wuf token is up now I personally don't like to buy tokens like this I like to buy either tokens that see organic growth by a lot of retail investors That You Don't See just a pump and dump alternatively I like to buy tokens where I see smart other Traders buying or where I see influencers buying and those influencers might afterwards promote the token on their YouTube or on their Twitter so have a look at this this channel has a premium membership the link is down below the bitcoin.com we are tracking various top Traders various whales and you have seen one of those whales buying constantly into the Boe or the book of ethereum token since August of this year we then started discussing this in our various channels right we've got various dedicated altcoin channels and this is how the price subsequently developed right in the last year more than 1,000% return making money in crypto is both a game of luck and skill and the more information we have the more we know that other people don't know the better that's how we buy assets smartly and how we avoid the manipulated stuff for example over here we are tracking influencer Alex Becker we've got 12 of its wallets not all of those wallets are well known or we are tracking influencer James win or influencer crypto gains we've got 436 wallets now in total they give us signals regularly and instead of buying what's currently green and be exit liquidity to manipulators we buy things before the influencers promote stuff it's all about timing it's all about finding the right information sources there's even a tutorial just on finding the right wallets in premium actually not just one tutorial there's a whole tutorial course there's eight videos on that topic how to find various influencer wallets how to find related wallets how to track those wallets how to interpret those wallet alerts in total there's more than 100 tutorial videos now there's also a money back guarantee so simply just message me within the first s days if you don't like what you see I'll refund you 100% so I'm personally staying away from from wolfy I don't want to guess how much longer this manipulation can last if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I publish you regularly a like would be very much appreciate as well it helps our Channel grow see you on the next video or see you even in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Y9CkjrB5A,"['Ethereum', 'Solana', 'JUST', 'WHY',

top $1 in shortterm price going to hit the top $1 I want to talk about the accessibility from where we can buy it's available everywhere in the world yesterday when I checked and I was amazed man it's available everywhere you name a platform binance coinbase okx Co coin htx Bing X mxc bro available everywhere in the world it got the accessibility it's just like one breakout once price breaks boom this volume that we guys can see over here we all can see I mean like a billion dollars of volume we have in the last 24 hours it'll be five time highers it will be five time higher than the volume we have at the moment 5 billion in a day market cap $128 million we have which will be like 5 times to 10 times in upcoming days in short term for longterm over $10 it's a really huge crypto it'll take some time and once it breaks bro boom parabolic move a new alltime high we're going to see in the picture let's talk about this to clb technically what's going on and then we'll be back again to the fundamentals the use case um how it going to play out for long term everything in and out we going to talk about this one okay but before we Deep dive into to clb I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I give a coin that buy xlm and within 12 hours we double our money from xlm within 12 hours I don't know how many of you have joined my VIP if you haven't joined my VIP on the screen you can see my WhatsApp number DM me send a message hi hello on WhatsApp I'll be adding you into my VIP daily signals daily profit join right now all the information about the ones which are going nonstop in the market

profit within 24 hours two days back join right now daily two trades daily you can make money let's come back to our topic clv how we should go about it so now people who are watching this video guys want to take a trade in clv watch this video we are away from one breakout horizontal line if I draw from here it dropped massively we have seen a flash sale from 15 cent so we need closing we need closing like this we need closing like this closing above the resistance from where price dropped price dropped from this level 0.1 15 it dropped massively and now it'll be trying to break but we have to wait if you are buying now at 12 cents if you are buying now at 12 cents 14 cents 10 cents you're going to lose everything in the market you deserve to lose money you are buying solely because oh I'll I'll buy I'll make money in the market bro don't go that way you will lose when we zoom out the graph it pumped a lot it's at the top and if you are buying the top somebody has to lose money to make money in the market like I took a trade let's take an example let's take an example I took a trade at 0.03 I want to sell somebody has to buy the top trading means what buy and sell I don't want you guys to be exit liquidity no I don't want that so whenever you take a trade we only have two ways to make money in the market it's extremely bullish I read in and out about clv but we have to wait for breakout once price breaks this level breaks this level closing above it 0.15 good to go nobody in the world will resist you to take a trade on clb after breakout after breakout I going to make videos I myself will add into my portfolio after breakout because after breakout it won't be staying it won't be staying fluctuating over here no it won't be it'll be pumping on stop after that if I zoom out the graph what going to happen it going to pump up to $1 in short term for longterm $10 $10 us yes my friend you heard it right $10 it got that much potential CV don't take it for granted oh it's a project which one no my my friend it's matter of time and we need breakout man once price breaks this level from where price dropped 15 cents once we see closing a it man 0.154 take a trade buy technically chart is indicating you're supposed to take a trade it's not me I'm not projecting something no I'm just explaining what's in the chat that's my job it's a big one don't take it for granted it going to be massive massive bro it'll be parabolic it'll be pumping parabolic man with back to back marabo candles in upcoming days a big really is on but if you are buying now bro it'll it'll drop and you will lose everything in the market if it if it don't break if it don't break it'll be back it'll be back to where it started off and that's how you're going to lose everything in the market mark my words if you are buying and if it won't break it'll be back I have talked about over 6,000 videos I have like 6,000 coins I have talked about I have made over 6,000 videos as of now in crypto specifically I I have the experience man have been doing for 10 years now and if I'm saying something I told totally minute man I not sugar coating something no if my job is to like say something Crystal Clear if it's bullish I'll say as simple as that it's a big one we just need breakout if price breaks 0.15 4155 B it'll be massive $1 price prediction put a stop loss 0 13 a stop

#magahat #crypto","make America great again the head meme coin is going up quite a bit today but also this whole week while the overall crypto Market isn't doing that great let's have a look at who's buying here who's selling here who's actually driving this R can this potentially last longer to answer that question we will of course as usual look at onchain metrics we will look at the number of whale wallets we will look at the number of retail wallets we will compare who's actually buying who's actually selling currently we are at 0.4 the price went up by 35% today it almost doubled this week but times haven't always been great we had a massive pump with the Peak at the end of May then a subsequent dump now we are recovering who's buying here this is not the first video on the mega Trump token I published one one month ago already at that time there was a lot of attention the number of views outperformed a regular video a follow-up video though underperformed very interesting as in attention seems to be slowing down let's first have a look at the mega Wales there's more than 18,000 holders in general of this token at least that's on chain 18,83 holders but more than 21% is been held by gate iio another 2.4% by Hui another 1.8% by Maxi Etc the large centralized exchanges tend to hold a lot of the token now the question is are they continuing to accumulate or are they potentially selling off an initial distribution they got here is the holding overtime of that gate IO wallet it's continuing to go up this is good here's the wallet by huabi which unfortunately did decline quite a bit by roughly 1/3 in the last week here is Mexi a very similar development also a similar degree of Decline and here we've got another centralized exchange also seeing rather accumulation Now by far the most important chart is really the gate io1 because it has almost 10 times of the holding of wallet number two and again we don't see any distribution here we see continued accumulation but when this is going up why did the price rather decline in the last month let's have a look at more aggregate statistics let's have a look at the number of retail investors versus whale investors is retail accumulating are the whales accumulating let's dive in to answer the question I have built a tool myself that's available to the premium members by the way you can plug in any token into this tool and you can see how many retail mediumsized retail and whale investors there are those are the long-term charts starting in middle of May so on the left side we've got a minimum holding of 2 million tokens at the current price that's equal to $773 that's what I'd consider small retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's a minimum holding of $77,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $70,000 at the current prices and so in the last month the price tended to rather Decline and here are the same kind of charts but only for the last month and here we see why that is it's the number of Wales the number of wallets that hold at least $70,000 worth of the mega hat token that's what went down by roughly 25% the importance of the Wales on the right is more than 100 times as high compared to the Wallets on the left so even though the number of retail investors grew by 10% it's really the whale wallets that pushed the price down and we can see how a lot of that selling stopped in the last week right again this is an entire month a lot of selling of those whales stopped in the last week medium-sized retail bought small retail bought as well the major exchange didn't distribute and that's why we're seeing some kind of reversal here so this looks like a relatively stable consolidation right it doesn't look like the Wales are now selling but in the end the price of this token is 100% in the hands of gate.io simply because there's so much holding on that exchange and this is definitely not just all customer funds this is a lot of Market making Capital as well and so of course we do see most of trading volume happening on gate.io so the onchain Matrix for Mega head look relatively good unfortunately the overall Market doesn't what we see over here behind me is the stable coin market cap of D of usdt of usdc B USD there's all kinds of stable coins in here and unfortunately we haven't seen any fiat currency flowing into crypto for more than two months now crypto isn't expanding anymore and so this is now becoming 100% a player versus player game and because of that I prefer in this market environment to rather short altcoins to rather bet on falling prices of altcoins most altcoins are very likely going to underperform going forward and so I don't necessarily want to pick the needle in the hay stack that might outperform I rather simply try to bet on the Hy stack itself so to put the odds in our favor we can simply just short a basket of various alt coins where there's no attention where the attention rather tends to bleed so for example I shot this altcoin over here I bet on this chart continuing to go down it already went down by roughly 50% this year and I make money as it continues to trickle down the reason why this goes down by the way is because the supply is expanding over time right to economics are hyper hyper important as there's more Supply hitting the market the price tends to go down if demand doesn't grow in the same manner and so in ambiguous markets like this I think it's better not to go too much risk on even though meah head in general looks fine I think shorting altcoins that tend to underperform over the long term are a safer bet and so there are tutorials on how to make money with falling prices I also share what kind of all altcoins I show for example the one I just showed that's all available Down Below in the premium membership it's the bitcoin.com if you've got a crypto portfolio that's above $5,000 or so then it's worth it for you if

&quot;BTC &amp; PEPE 4H Analysis: Crypto Giant and Meme Token Market Structure&quot;,"""Welcome to our essential 4-hour timeframe analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) and PEPE, offering crucial insights into both the broader crypto market leader and the viral meme token phenomenon. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart is currently displaying significant technical developments, with price action testing critical support levels that could determine the next directional move. The recent volume profile suggests accumulation patterns at key technical zones, while momentum indicators are showing potential divergence signals that traders should closely monitor. Moving to PEPE, the 4-hour structure reveals fascinating price behavior, with the meme token showing interesting correlation patterns with Bitcoin's movements. PEPE's recent volatility has created multiple technical setups worth watching, particularly around key Fibonacci levels that have been acting as both support and resistance. The volume analysis on PEPE's 4H timeframe indicates retail interest cycles that often precede significant price movements. We're seeing distinct patterns forming on both assets that could signal upcoming opportunities, with Bitcoin's market dominance directly influencing PEPE's potential moves. This dual analysis provides a comprehensive view of both mainstream and meme token markets, essential for traders operating in these volatile sectors. Understanding the interplay between BTC and PEPE is crucial, as major Bitcoin moves typically cascade through the meme token market, creating both risks and opportunities that savvy traders can capitalize on.""  #Bitcoin #PEPE #4HAnalysis #CryptoTrading #BTCAnalysis #MemeTokens #TechnicalAnalysis #CryptoMarkets #PEPEcoin #MarketStructure  Connect with Us! ==============  YouTube: ‚û°    / @innerracers   Facebook: ‚û°   / innerracers   TikTok: ‚û°   / innerracers   Telegram: ‚û° https://t.me/innerracers Website: ‚û° ebirth.net Contact Us: ‚û° 0357286586 / 0357287387 / 0114492444 WhatsApp ‚û° https://wa.me/94114492444  Subscribe and Join Our Community: =============================  YouTube Channel ‚û° @InnerRacers Join our Telegram ‚û° https://t.me/innerracers",Transcript not available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18CdtkkRYA0,['Pepe'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/18CdtkkRYA0/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-18T04:34:22Z

let's dive all right guys for this talken we will not use the ination accumulation pump model because uh of course it just leas it on a binance but this is not a brand new toen uh it's on Max signs October uh 24 uh but on a DEX screener from October 19 it's one more token from the pump fun it's kind of interesting why the binance start list the tokens uh from pum fund so fast for me it's kind of interesting because the binance HS that they got some criteria you know for the leasing uh the big Community around the toen and I'm not sure I'm not sure this toen build so big Community uh lasted than uh lessed than in one months so just in case so ship traded a long time period before the Le on binance right even the papa and many many other tokens uh listed not so fast like turbo just for example over the year they lay down at a bottom on some random exchanges right and then on after that the biners decid to list now the peanuts listed just in eye blink right and skare Rocket over the I guess 2 billion market cap and the a just exists on a pump fun we're in a binance it's crazy and this is the binance effect $1 around one bill market cap the peanut now has uh like two Bill market cap so the same story can be with the act for example right we can't know seven Bill market cap or 9 Bill market cap the same story can be like with a Peppa we can't know where this stock and will stop so nobody knows binance listing just a open space so now it's like around one b market cap reach it you can open the chart of Papa when it's listed in minus we see something like this one then canellation and continuation two billion 3 billion 5 billion 7 billion market cap is it be the same story or not we can't know in the moment of course uh here it's crazy because less than one month ago the price was on radium 0 2075 on the radium I can't even imagine what the price was on the pump fun and it's kind of interesting you know of course I totally understand that some some guys who bought it here it's not an S so they still hold it now you know of course their hands changes you know so somebody buying here selling here buying back here selling here buying back here so it's always in Dynamic right so we can't say uh some Wills hold it buying here and hold it of course yes some Wheels can accumulate it in this range and spread it between like 100 wallets and hold it but anyway congrats everybody who on the max accumulate this stocking even at two cents because you made a crazy uh right in the one week you made a 5,000% gains almost so congrats it's definitely guys not a mistake to fix some profit don't be so greedy don't be so greedy always uh take some profit and it would be not a mistake now we leave the Gap uh here daily one so we got to main one Gap is going to be here that one let's mark like a zone for correction potential correction it's not necess so we will drop to that zone now or later you know guys just in case so but it's more than real to see because five Sol per gains if for example BTC will go to correction on the next week or uh off the week you know yes it can be the story like with a Celestia like this one 2 22 C just open the chart of SL you will see and you will understand what I'm talking about but of course guys uh congrats everybody who come later here what to do now you know it's only up to you guys so uh just in case $2 you understand right so $2 two Bill market cap so if you buy now so here you invest at 87 so $2 two billon market cap it's will be only for you 127% profit if on next week we will go for example to correction two test only the daily imbalance Zone it will be minus 52% on a a spot uh for your account so just in case just work with a proper risk management guys of course only the sky is a limit now but I'm always about a logic so if I could be the trader who bought it here or the whale or Market maker you know of course I'm definitely uh can push the price higher to distribute higher but anyway I will step by step sell it sell it sell then maybe uh buy some news buy some f around because we can't go only Unstoppable up right it's Market Market is always at the structure like this so just in case just build a plan is it is it 88 cents comfortable price for you to buy or not so make a deal with yourself let's take a look with M what Wills do now with this toen locally of course uh there not enough uh like history for that talking but take a look uh this was accumulation it's kind of interesting because November 10 it was accumulation and now this is not a crazy distribution so this kind of interesting but it's crazy uh a fre of course on the chart 12 time frame a little bit better so here if you track this talk in on a Max here it was November 1st and accumulation so this is a distribution Zone but without any signal to sell or immediately out of that token but yes it's a definitely a free of of De one so yes we can call it the binance binance U effect money power take a look the daily time frame here here's a money in Money outflow was yesterday and today is money outflow so the will step by step on a daily fix but guys it can be you know the story like this one range and one more impulse down up and then only down or or it can be like this Mo we can't know any a moment and going higher absolutely we can't absolutely know nothing about the after new alltime high but it's always about your logic and your own decision my choice is skip this stock in at 1 billion market cap after just uh L than one month and L on binance so 5,000% gains in one single uh in one single week it's not the asset what I want to what I want to invest now you know for the gains 12 out time frame uh here's 1 2 3 4 yes two days in Row the money outow step by step so somewh to fixed profit so at least with round naal deposit 12 time frame trade on no data 4our 10 frame no data one hour in frame here's how they fix some profit step by step buy buy so the main signals to buy was here unfortunately unfortunately I can't track every single token and it's impossible it's impossible there are a million tokens here's a sale sell sell some step by step uh they fix some profit uh and the last one is let's take profit indicator uh here what I talk about 4 hours in frame 12 and frame no data 4 hours in frame exit line now it's 0.5 L by Fe of uh daily Gap it's only exit line where till that time when we will see some for example like this correction will be the exit line we can't know maybe it will be this Mo just a test of uh uh fa G so all lines are Dynamic so exit line now it's 2246 buy line on 4 hours in frame it's 10 cents so just in case guys so one hour time frame and here this is how it looks like we Pump It test set exit line exit line on a one hour time frame it's 73 cents uh take profit line 65 buy line it's 33 and 7 so this is a zones where you can buy back if you want to accumulate this coin again you know and if we will see the correction so my take is just bad no rush you know because a lot of times I saw the people hop in on some HP when the talking pump like crazy one to one bilon market cap or over than three billon market cap and after uh just Tiny correction just logical correction 50% so the asset made a 5,000% then we get a correction 50% but people uh screamed what's going on why do I lose my money so guys work with proper risk management my take it will be not not a mistake to fix some profit and will be okay accumulate this token again in zone of you have to build your own zone of Interest I hope you like this video if you would like to trade with my custom I showed in this video Just Right medm subscribe Chan hit the like button notification buttom don't forget Jo myam Channel see you next time

most successful videos on this channel was the video on Notch coin the leading memec coin on the ton blockchain and the reason for that success is because the price has doubled just within 4 days now in this video I want to talk about how to spot winners like this early I also want to talk about what to do now with not coin given that it's risen that much should we buy still or should we take some profit now here's the performance of that video in Gray is a typical video on this channel in blue is the performance of the not coin video there's still quite a bit of traffic indicating there is a lot of interest interest tends to translate into purchases and those purchases those buy orders they of course push up the price the price tends to rise just until the long-term holders that bought low tend to sell and so when this chart here doesn't rise that much anymore we might have a problem with not coin so far there's still a lot of interest so the prior video was published at 1.2 cents 4 days ago now we are at 2.3 cents so if this is your first time to hear about not coin then feel free to follow channels like this I try to be early and I publish videos regularly right now NCoin is at a $2.5 billion market cap now how can a market cap like this be achieved in such a short period of time is there really $1.2 billion flowing into NCoin within just a few days the tldr is of course no NCoin does get a lot of manipulation by the centralized exchanges there are very few transactions onchain on the ton blockchain so we've already talked about this in the prior video when we look at the ton chain Explorer so that's ton scan.org we barely see any transactions here maybe one or two transactions every hour and so why is then the price exploding that much I believe again it's a lot of manipulation and what the centralized exchanges are doing is they push up the price of a specific coin that doesn't have too much market cap at the time generating a lot of attention as we have seen just in the YouTube Studio back end right there's a lot of views on this coin because the price went up people want to know why the price went up and as there is more attention people buy in and then the centralized exchanges can gradually sell either gradually or they can also just directly crash the price in case there's too many people that get on this with levered trading like with derivatives for example with Perpetual Futures contracts have a look there is hundreds of millions of open interest on not coin on various centralized exchanges and that open interest might be balanced that's then when the funding rate is at zero and when we look at binance and okx which had the most trading volume in the last 24 hours you can see again the funding rate is relatively balanced relatively close to zero which would indicate that the market makers so far do not have interest in crashing the price thus what I believe makes most sense here is to use a trailing stop- loss as already said in the prior video so it does make sense to write this wave but at some some point when people use too much leverage and the funding rates get too much out of whack and the price shoots up you want to adjust your stop loss very very closely because then at some point the price might again collapse we've seen this several times for example with Y Finance or with ygg or various other coin when there are Perpetual Futures that are heavily trading and when there is a massive rally and when the funding rates get out of wh then the real manipulation happens and so today NCoin is by far outperforming everything else the same can be said for this week but the same canot be said for the overall altcoin Market what you've got over here is the altcoin market as a share of all of crypto it's currently at 27% and it's actually not going up that much we actually overall in the Alton Market had a pretty poor performance in the last weeks there are several reasons for that poor performance I don't want to talk about this now again on this video but what's very important to notice here is that performance is very much concent traded in just a few assets some altcoins outperform sometimes or let's rather say a few altcoins outperform very rarely most of the time Bitcoin is outperforming all the rest so it does make sense to trade altcoins actively you don't just want to buy and hold especially risky manipulated meme coin now let's talk about how to find the next pumping coin and I want to share how I personally bought into an ny derivative so that's also a mcoin it's on ethereum it's not the endd on base but on ethereum it's a different token but with that Indy token we've also doubled our money in a very short period of time this is where I bought here so here's what we are doing we track various influencers and we figured out that James win he bought into the ND token not on base but on ethereum so look at the price it's very different to the base token influencer James win bought in for roughly 150k over the span of 3 days so what we're doing here in premium right the link is down below the bitcoin.com what we're doing is we try to find different influencers wallets with all kinds of onchain analytics we've even got a chat where we try to discover different wallets we've got some of James win and so we follow the influencers we see what they are buying and then afterwards after they have bought they very often make a video about the token once they make that video right once they publish the video on YouTube then the price shoots up because again a lot of attention is on the token so what we want to do is we want to front run the general audience we want to almost get Insider information it's technically not Insider information because the blockchain is a public Ledger but still we Tred to be earlier than the masses we find out that an influencer Buys in heavily and then I shared that I bought this as well so again this was on Monday on the 27th and then you're waiting a few hours maybe a few days we get our promotion the price pumps and we make the profit it of course doesn't always work like this right sometimes influence buy something without promoting it or sometimes an influencer might buy something and even though they might promote it it might not really shoot up so it's of course not a strategy that always works but it's definitely better than just drawing random lines on charts and trying to predict where the price goes it's much better to do what the smart money is doing to do what the people that tend to make profit in crypto to emulate those kinds of people and so besides James win buying we also analyzed the number of holders over time we saw that retail bought in quite a lot we also saw that James wi tended to buy low and sell high and he started buying again that's also great we also saw that from his 2 million portfolio he's got 400,000 So 20% in the Indy token and of course we also check the security of the token as in is there a Honeypot potential and what's the current market cap SL liquidity pool so again if you want to step up your crypto game maybe it makes sense to follow influencer wallets right try to find influencer wallets try to track them with all kinds of bots there are tutorials again in premium about this if you are looking very deeply though on YouTube you might also find tutorials that are free over here so you don't have to necessarily sign up for premium especially if your crypto portfolio isn't at large enough the main message here is don't just try to buy what currently pumped up or don't just buy what everybody is talking about try to be early try to find information sources most people don't have follow Twitter accounts that call certain cryptocurrencies early follow YouTube account accounts that talk about a cryptocurrency before it doubles Pur rate your information sources because then you can get Alpha right only the minority of people wins and so you want to get your information from the minority from the winners you don't just want to genuinely follow any kind of influencer because again most influencers pump and dump on you again if it's your first time here feel to subscribe I publish you regly like would be very much appreciate as well if you don't yet want to join premium there's also a free telegram feel free to check that out link is as well down below see you over there",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0capo51UWo,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'JUST', 'WHY',

on is this Market manipulation who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the onchain data most people are not considering so this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at almost $70 per token but when we zoom out a little bit we can see that there were multiple pumps and dumps in the Tor price the recent 50% rally can barely be seen on that chart simply because the pump before was so massive now this is the long-term price chart but have a look at the long-term market cap chart those charts are slightly different Can you spot the difference in the price chart from this peak to this peak we less than doubled in the market cap chart though we almost tripled why is that the reason is token inflation there had been more and more trb tokens floating around the increasing Supply then depresses the price despite a lot of capital getting locked up in in trb and so this is then how that looks like over time this is the circulating Supply and at the beginning that Supply expansion was really a problem from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 the supply pretty much 5x since then the growth is rather small so it used to be a problem isn't a problem anymore that's very important to know because for most altcoins especially recently launched altcoins we have always the problem of token inflation and time is not necessarily on our side with tellor we don't have that problem so if the overall altcoin Market is going up I don't expect a circulating Supply expansion to depress the tellor price now this is not the first video on trb I made one half a year ago relatively successful so the gray area is a typical video the blue line was that first trb video this guy here by the way is one of the founders of DWF Labs that manipulate the price at the time so that's the cause for this pump and dump more videos followed more interest in Tor follow as well just look at this Delta here another video so obviously you guys like my analysis on Tor feel free to check out the prior videos and feel free to follow this channel because I publish videos regularly and try to be early now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just going through the website in selling you the marketing Jazz I'm interested in the data most people are not considering and so we want to find out what's causing this rally and how much longer this can last unfortunately the Twitter doesn't have a lot of news so this is not a place with any useful information unfortunately the GitHub repository might be a bit more useful so this is a place where programmers submit their code changes we can see how much product development there is and yes there are changes four repositories got changed in the last 24 hours another one here yesterday a lot of activity in the layer repository let's have a look at that here's the number of code changes each day so one and a half months ago there was quite a bit of activity still a bit now but I had a look at the recent updates and that was mainly just unit testing as in making the platform a bit more stable not necessarily new product development so let's have a look at the onchain metrics because we want to know who's buying and who's selling here right when the price is going up then there's obviously more buyers than sellers or at least there's more Capital flowing in than flowing out let's have a look at what retail is doing versus what the whales are doing so there are currently 8,554 holders of the ethereum based teot token and here is the development of the number of wallets over time based on a minimum holding threshold so on the left side we've got the wallets the number of wallets that hold at least 15 trb tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 that's what I'd consider small retail for the middle chart we go a 10x for that minimum holding threshold so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right chart we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token very similar holder Dynamics not a lot of buying nor selling there are our ups and downs but overall the number of investors on chain at least is not increasing over time now why do I say on chain I say on chain because a lot of the trading volume of trb actually does not happen transparently on the blockchain initially DWF laabs a market maker held a lot of trb tokens then over time binance took over those tokens bought the tokens from DWF and so now we see most of trading volume happening on binance and also on okx let's have a look so here's the hold up pie chart of TR B here we've got binance here we've got okx another binance wallet here's the balance development of the first binance wallet sometimes nothing in there sometimes a lot that's probably when the manipulation goes up then again nothing then again a lot feel free to check those charts out right feel free to correlate this with the price charts here's the second binance wallet also very similar we go up and down very erratically and here's the okx wallet okx tends to be accumulating but also again with a lot of vol ility especially since beginning of the year okx is stepping up the game so they started buying heavily over here quite ironic isn't it but that's the problem with trb it's in the hands of the very heavy weights it's not organic demand that's driving up prices check out this chart behind me this is the spot market trading volume per exchange binance is of course dominating afterwards comes okx no surprise here they hold most of the tokens we've also got a bit of coinbase Etc but still this is a battle between binance and okx here is the Perpetual Futures Market a ton of Leverage through binance also a bit through okx and buy it interestingly enough as well even though they don't have that much spot so what's happening here is that on the one hand the exchanges hold a lot of the token they can influence the price up and down but on the other hand they also offer bets on the price right through the derivatives through the peral Futures so you can bet on the outcome of the game you can bet on whether or not the price goes up or down with leverage but at the same time the house can liquidate you if they simply want to because again the trading volume on binance alone on the Perpetual Futures was 2.4 billion 24 hours 2.4 billion the market cap is only 180 million so every trb token moved more than 10 times in the last 24 hours that's how much manipulation there is these pump and dumps can go on for a very long time we've seen it in the past we've seen tib go up all the way to $250 if you consider betting on this R which I personally don't but if you consider betting on this R then make sure to protect yourself against the downside risk make sure to have a trailing stop loss at least as the price Rises you want to adjust your stop loss and once the price turns around you want to exit very very quickly because then potentially the price can crash forcing all kinds of people that are with levered bets in there to sell their Tor for cheap if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly also on tellor feel free to also give this a like

Turbo Review, Turbo Price, Turbo Price Prediction, Turbo longterm, Turbo Tokenomics,   #turbo #memecoin #crypto","77% gains in the last 7 Days that's the price development of Turbo let's have a look at what's causing all of this let's try to find out how much longer this really can last so here we are we are currently at 0.6 cents and yes the last week looked very nice but the price development longterm wasn't without its dramas we have seen some pumps and subsequent dumps before now this is not the first time I talk about tobo on this channel I published multiple videos on the token and what's interesting about about those videos is that all of them tended to outperform the typical video on this channel so typical video is in Gray and in blue is the number of views of this particular turbo video but have a look at this video same thing outperformance for this video also performing better or check this out better than the average and the same is true for the recent video so there's clearly a lot of attention on the token does that attention also turned into purchases to answer that question I've developed various on chain analytics tools we've got one for Solana another one for the evm compatible chains and turbo is listed on both blockchains let's start off with the Solana token what we see on the left is the number of Wallets on Solana that have at least 160,000 turbo tokens at the current price that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token that's what I consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail so we go now at 10x in minimum holding so 1.6 million or $1,000 worth of the token that also increases over time on the right we've got the Wales so that's now 16 million tokens or $100,000 worth of the token and so there are no whales on Solana for Turbo there are six medium-sized wallets and there are a bit over 100 small retail wallets the real action happens on ethereum because here are the same kind of charts but for the ethereum chain the same thresholds and the holder development looks very different here whales aren't accumulating anymore more since the first purchase during the launch days medium-sized retail did do quite some purchasing at the end of May and small retail did the same again during the month of May and that then stopped with the month of June the growth was way slower and so this is the price development during that time have a look at this peak here this is the end of May so the price stopped rallying it did find a floor and that's no surprise because none of the holders are really net selling they accumul in very slowly or holding and so it's interesting how much volatility there is in the price as in how much the price goes up and down when the number of holders isn't changing that much right this is a move from almost 1 cent all the way down to 0.3 cents so a 70% drop while the number of holders really didn't fluctuate that much during that time I've got an idea why this is happening but more on that later let's first zoom into the recent past let's look at the last month so in the last month we went up by 53% and again pretty much all of those gains happened in the last week here are the same kind of holder charts but instead of looking at this very longterm we just look at the last month and again this is on ethereum we do see continued accumulation by retail at mediumsized retail and the Wales but the growth isn't really that massive the number of retail wallets grew by roughly 200 so that's a bit under 2% growth in a month mediumsized retail grew by roughly 40 again roughly 2% the number of Wales relatively speaking grew the most so that's 12 wallets or roughly 5 to 6% so everyone is buying the whales are buying most and so what's causing all the volatility in the price I think the centralized exchanges have their hands on the token as well this is not a meme coin for the lighthearted 30% of all of trading volume happens on binance 20% on okx 15% on gate.io and on top of the spot market we've also got Perpetual futures trading again dominated by okx and binance centralized exchanges make money from Trading and the more volatility there is on the price the more fees get generated and so maybe there is no clear interest on the price Direction but probably there is some interest in shaking the price up and down every now and then so I don't think it's very wise to use stop losses for example if there are enough people with stop losses then probably the price will briefly at least fall below and then potentially recover again again creating trading fees potentially even liquidation fees now it seems like we are back into mem coin trading season again because check this out this is a video on Nero that outperformed a typical video or check this out the baby Doge also an outperformer but your standard altcoin that's not a meme coin tends to not perform that well here's piff here is Jupiter here is a tier and so in the premium Community we are hunting for New Meme coins yet again I'm sharing of course my trades as well I for example bought drift recently that's not a meme coin but that's playing the prison presidential election so that went up more than 70% since purchase then we talked about Nero since August 3rd that went up more than 20,000% since then and so we've got a dedicated premium altcoin chat where we talk about all kinds of alts and of course we are also tracking other influencers and see when they are buying and selling so in case you've got a crypto portfolio that's at least $5,000 worth feel free to check it out the link is down below it's the Bitcoin tray.com and of course if you don't want to miss the next update on tobo feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly on various meme coins feel free to also

let's dive all right guys for this talken we will not use the ination accumulation pump model because uh of course it just leas it on a binance but this is not a brand new toen uh it's on Max signs October uh 24 uh but on a DEX screener from October 19 it's one more token from the pump fun it's kind of interesting why the binance start list the tokens uh from pum fund so fast for me it's kind of interesting because the binance HS that they got some criteria you know for the leasing uh the big Community around the toen and I'm not sure I'm not sure this toen build so big Community uh lasted than uh lessed than in one months so just in case so ship traded a long time period before the Le on binance right even the papa and many many other tokens uh listed not so fast like turbo just for example over the year they lay down at a bottom on some random exchanges right and then on after that the biners decid to list now the peanuts listed just in eye blink right and skare Rocket over the I guess 2 billion market cap and the a just exists on a pump fun we're in a binance it's crazy and this is the binance effect $1 around one bill market cap the peanut now has uh like two Bill market cap so the same story can be with the act for example right we can't know seven Bill market cap or 9 Bill market cap the same story can be like with a Peppa we can't know where this stock and will stop so nobody knows binance listing just a open space so now it's like around one b market cap reach it you can open the chart of Papa when it's listed in minus we see something like this one then canellation and continuation two billion 3 billion 5 billion 7 billion market cap is it be the same story or not we can't know in the moment of course uh here it's crazy because less than one month ago the price was on radium 0 2075 on the radium I can't even imagine what the price was on the pump fun and it's kind of interesting you know of course I totally understand that some some guys who bought it here it's not an S so they still hold it now you know of course their hands changes you know so somebody buying here selling here buying back here selling here buying back here so it's always in Dynamic right so we can't say uh some Wills hold it buying here and hold it of course yes some Wheels can accumulate it in this range and spread it between like 100 wallets and hold it but anyway congrats everybody who on the max accumulate this stocking even at two cents because you made a crazy uh right in the one week you made a 5,000% gains almost so congrats it's definitely guys not a mistake to fix some profit don't be so greedy don't be so greedy always uh take some profit and it would be not a mistake now we leave the Gap uh here daily one so we got to main one Gap is going to be here that one let's mark like a zone for correction potential correction it's not necess so we will drop to that zone now or later you know guys just in case so but it's more than real to see because five Sol per gains if for example BTC will go to correction on the next week or uh off the week you know yes it can be the story like with a Celestia like this one 2 22 C just open the chart of SL you will see and you will understand what I'm talking about but of course guys uh congrats everybody who come later here what to do now you know it's only up to you guys so uh just in case $2 you understand right so $2 two Bill market cap so if you buy now so here you invest at 87 so $2 two billon market cap it's will be only for you 127% profit if on next week we will go for example to correction two test only the daily imbalance Zone it will be minus 52% on a a spot uh for your account so just in case just work with a proper risk management guys of course only the sky is a limit now but I'm always about a logic so if I could be the trader who bought it here or the whale or Market maker you know of course I'm definitely uh can push the price higher to distribute higher but anyway I will step by step sell it sell it sell then maybe uh buy some news buy some f around because we can't go only Unstoppable up right it's Market Market is always at the structure like this so just in case just build a plan is it is it 88 cents comfortable price for you to buy or not so make a deal with yourself let's take a look with M what Wills do now with this toen locally of course uh there not enough uh like history for that talking but take a look uh this was accumulation it's kind of interesting because November 10 it was accumulation and now this is not a crazy distribution so this kind of interesting but it's crazy uh a fre of course on the chart 12 time frame a little bit better so here if you track this talk in on a Max here it was November 1st and accumulation so this is a distribution Zone but without any signal to sell or immediately out of that token but yes it's a definitely a free of of De one so yes we can call it the binance binance U effect money power take a look the daily time frame here here's a money in Money outflow was yesterday and today is money outflow so the will step by step on a daily fix but guys it can be you know the story like this one range and one more impulse down up and then only down or or it can be like this Mo we can't know any a moment and going higher absolutely we can't absolutely know nothing about the after new alltime high but it's always about your logic and your own decision my choice is skip this stock in at 1 billion market cap after just uh L than one month and L on binance so 5,000% gains in one single uh in one single week it's not the asset what I want to what I want to invest now you know for the gains 12 out time frame uh here's 1 2 3 4 yes two days in Row the money outow step by step so somewh to fixed profit so at least with round naal deposit 12 time frame trade on no data 4our 10 frame no data one hour in frame here's how they fix some profit step by step buy buy so the main signals to buy was here unfortunately unfortunately I can't track every single token and it's impossible it's impossible there are a million tokens here's a sale sell sell some step by step uh they fix some profit uh and the last one is let's take profit indicator uh here what I talk about 4 hours in frame 12 and frame no data 4 hours in frame exit line now it's 0.5 L by Fe of uh daily Gap it's only exit line where till that time when we will see some for example like this correction will be the exit line we can't know maybe it will be this Mo just a test of uh uh fa G so all lines are Dynamic so exit line now it's 2246 buy line on 4 hours in frame it's 10 cents so just in case guys so one hour time frame and here this is how it looks like we Pump It test set exit line exit line on a one hour time frame it's 73 cents uh take profit line 65 buy line it's 33 and 7 so this is a zones where you can buy back if you want to accumulate this coin again you know and if we will see the correction so my take is just bad no rush you know because a lot of times I saw the people hop in on some HP when the talking pump like crazy one to one bilon market cap or over than three billon market cap and after uh just Tiny correction just logical correction 50% so the asset made a 5,000% then we get a correction 50% but people uh screamed what's going on why do I lose my money so guys work with proper risk management my take it will be not not a mistake to fix some profit and will be okay accumulate this token again in zone of you have to build your own zone of Interest I hope you like this video if you

of 2025 Bitcoin and altcoins have experienced a sharp dip in the last few days this is the time in my opinion you should be dcing into Super Trend cryptocurrencies that could make you a millionaire AI altcoins have been very strong this is going to go into the early trillions by the end of the bull market so which AI altcoins will make you huge Bank my name's the Superman your superhero of 100 to 1,000x gems back in March I spoke to you about a coin called tits which was 233k market cap and only in the last few days has it gone up to near 500 million over 2,000x no YouTuber will find you multiples of that size so if you love content like this make sure you smash a like on this video and make sure that you subscribe so you never miss out there are a lot of you that are watching the videos but not subscribing and subscribing is how you make the real money Bitcoin large caps and the rest of the market have been experiencing a large dip because of overheating in the market 88 out of 100 this is as Bitcoin approached that magic 100K value back in the last week of November in 2020 the exact point where we are at now in theet Market cycle Bitcoin went from near $20,000 down to $117,000 11% but what happened after we went into an incredible up only phase where we are at right now we have had a dip of only 6% now that could mean that we have got more to fall but in my personal opinion this is the time to truly take positions before the violent up only cycle begins why I've been able to make such massive multipliers is because of my investment strategy I like to invest in cryptocurrencies that fall slap bang in the middle of the Pay Dirt formula I look for four specific qualities in a cryptocurrency first of all I look for super Trend narratives these include gaming rwa but more importantly Ai and memes which I think are going to be the real super trends of this cycle they are easy to understand easy to explain and furthermore easy to use this is why Ai and me coins are very very strong cryptocurrencies because they tell a great story a super Trend the next thing I look for is a real Deen market cap the starting market cap has to be low for me to invest cryptocurrency is here for one thing to make you rich a lot of the YouTubers will give you 5 10x shouts but me I look for the ones that are very low market caps the one where you throw a load of darts at a dart board but you hit Bull's eyes the more you you throw them I was able to turn $600 into 1.25 million thanks to one altcoin so D gen market caps ideally in the low Millions is my starting point when investing in a new asset new and unpumped in the last bull market all of the ones that were new were the ones that made the massive multipliers and ideally unpumped cuz people like Virgin Territory where they can be the first to make the money and then the last thing is tell a good story I like to invest in AI daps that look like the things I've seen on TV and in movies about the future and how the future looks in terms of automation AI humanoid and this story is what captures other people to invest so if there's a cryptocurrency that falls right slap bang in the middle of all of these that is where you hit Pay Dirt that is where you can hit the millions of dollars these are the four main types of AI altcoin the larg market caps are the infrastructures but where I see the money making potential is in generative AI which is where you use adap to create something that you want an AI agents task orientated autopilot Bots that do exactly what you want to do and they do it better every single time these are the two areas I think tell the best story and showcase the future of what AI can do as usual nothing I say is to be construed as Financial advice crypto is largely unregulated and highrisk and people who invest should be prepared to lose all their money and everything I see to you in this video is for informational and educational purposes only the first undiscovered AI altcoin I've got for you is deep fake AI deep fake AI is a completely unique AI project in crypto currency no other project that allows you to create deep fake videos so this has a monopoly it's a first mover therefore any interest in AI based deep fake technology will go 100% into this and that's why I believe that this could explode from its present market cap of 7.4 million this is a minuscule market cap compared to the likes of render artificial super intelligence which are in the billions this one to get to a billion which I think is very achievable would make it a 100x from here so with deep fake AI they have got two key features that you can use create deep fake viral videos the first thing is the web app this is an area where the team have already pre-up loaded videos of celebrities and their audio files so that you get a truly authentic and realistic experience I created a video using deep fake AI of Alex Becka and people in the comments thought it was actually him so what you can do is you can create entire videos with these celebrities and they're downloadable and sharable on social media there was a video of Janet Yellen that was made with deep fake AI that got 40 million views because somebody made a funny video using this deep fake technology people are trying to get me to shill shitcoins with this trash what is it deep fake AI app. fake A.O to me I think it's absolutely incredible so you can firstly make it say anything you want so you can do a funny skit or make it promotee something that you have created or you can ask the celebrity a question and then their answer again is a downloadable video now I saw deep fake technology in a Netflix film called Tim where the founder of the AI company actually has a deep faked video where he welcomes everybody coming into the building this technology I think is a game changer it's very very disruptive but the second feature is what I believe is the money maker and that is creating your own deep fake character what you do is you give it a name and then you upload video and audio and then you have got a readymade made deep fake version of whoever you want to create so whereas the web app has basically prescribe people so people that the team have identified can be used but create you can make your own you can make one of you one of an employer one of a family member or you can make one of a minor celebrity or a celebrity that isn't featured feed in the web app so you can create your own all you have to do is download the videos from the internet you can download it from YouTube and then you upload it and then you've got your readymade character and I think this is just superb I personally could upload a few of my videos to the Creator character functionality and then I can pretty much make AI deep fake videos of me without actually having to film my own videos for technology this unique in cryptocurrency I think this market cap is ridiculously low and I think this one is going to have a second win it previously went to a $41 million market cap and it lost 52 x its value therefore this is pretty much bottomed for the next phase and with AI being such a massive super Trend I could see this doing a 100x if not beyond that the second undiscovered gem I have got for you is Mirai miray is a generative AI project they allow you to create gaming worlds and gaming characters with text prompts so you can create 3D assets and the worlds for games now another project that did the exact same thing is neural AI which today sits at 80 million and only in the last week did this get up to a100 million market cap so if meai was to get to where neural AI is that would be a 30X just on neural ai's current price and I think that neural AI is still going to do another 10x so this has got potentially 270x ahead of it so miray incorporates two of my favorite types of AI technology firstly the generative side of it so you are able to create virtual environments and virtual characters but not only that you are able to have a I agents to enhance user interaction you not only have the ability to create characters and the worlds so you could create Call of Duty you could create the map you could create the characters that then shoot each other on the map but also with the AI agents you actually give intellectual life artificial intelligence to the computer controlled characters in a game so what you've got here is an entire game creation solution with AI so why Mirai particularly appeals to me is because they have got the Gen AI functionality they incorporate it with AI agents which like generative AI is a very bullish AI narrative and to make this even more appealing this is also a gaming play so this is AI and gaming so it touches on two super Trends miror is one of the few that actually gives you these three three bullish elements in one project and yet it is 2.61 million market cap and 2.94 million fully diluted value so there is going to be no dilution like a meme coin there is not going to be any inflation that's going to bring the value down there's no Wales to rip the liquidity away because they got cheap coins this to me is an extremely pumpable cryptocurrency and the thing is is that is very very new this only came out in around about August that means it never even experienced a bll market the bull Trend earlier this year ended at the end of March so this came out four months into bearishness so this has never had an opportunity to be able to pump and that's why this is new unpumped and extremely low market cap neural AI is one of my best multipliers for AI projects this year and the starting market cap was 2.5 million before it did a 40x and this market cap is virtually identical and the team is very active as well constantly tweeting and updating the technology so as far as I'm concerned this is a really high quality AI project at a ridiculously low market cap this one reasonably believe could 100x if not more the next hidden AI gem I have got for you is Sensei Sensei is a unique project in Ai and in cryptocurrency only a 6.2 million market cap Sensei is taking a Black Mirror episode and turning it into reality allowing for you to exist Beyond Death Sensei allows you to create a digital autonomous replica of yourself so you can be communicated with after death and who who knows where this technology could potentially go I know he's dead but I can sign you up to something that helps click the link and you talk to it it mimics him and reads through all the things they've ever said online the more it has the more it's him so with Sensei you create a second self you almost can create an entire team so where Sensei is useful is for people with dementia you can create replicas to preserve memories custom replicas for Unique needs education where you can share knowledge globally 24/7 in any language so let's say for instance my udemy courses these can be uploaded to Sensei and shared in multiple languages and then fan engagement any celebrity influencer or even just your normal person can be interacted with at any point a second version of you mirrors your behavior and interaction maintaining a constant digital presence and they've already created some digital replicas here which I think are only going to get better with time you'll have video chat with any of these replicas I think this is a very Grand scope vision for AI and the fact that at this point it's only 6.22 million and that it came out again after a bull Trend means this hasn't yet even had its pump and it has lost 2x from the alltime high that it did achieve relatively bottomed AI project that has huge upside potential this could 100x and still be well below a billion dollar market cap and given this again is a first mover it's got unique technology the money flow can easily float into this once it's discovered out there by The Wider crypto investing and AI investing population and again this is an active team last year important knowledge walked out of the door when a key team member left this year Sensei replicas securely preserve your institutional knowledge ensuring nothing gets lost this is a great technology and I can see this going very far in the future the fourth undiscovered AI gem I have got for you is zero AI zero AI is a generative AI software it allows you to create videos from text prompts it is presently 1.8 million market cap now zero AI replicates an $80 billion product called sora AI Sora AI was brought out by the same guys who brought out chat GPT it allows you to turn your words into amazing videos great for anyone who makes content sells products teaches or loves making videos now if you go try now it will say to you you can't use it because the public cannot use Sora it is only for influencers people of notoriety news outlets but at this present time you cannot use this technology and yet it is extremely high valued and all it is is a text to video generator now zero AI is basically the exact same now think about it Sora is worth 80 billion and zero is worth 1.8 million and just look at the quality of the videos that you get with zero AI the animation is absolutely beautiful now I have personally used zero AI to create b-roll footage for my videos because I can tell zero to give me exactly what I want as a content creator most people use story blocks story blocks allows you to access a video library of what other users have uploaded so you rely on someone else's idea you can never get the exact video you want and the thing is it costs actually a lot of money on a monthly basis to use this software but with zero as long as you've got the tokens you are able to use this technology and get precisely what you want and yeah it's not rubbish stuff look the quality of the videos is actually what I am expecting from from Sora once it actually starts but you can't actually really see much of what is in Sora so zero AI to me I think is just one of those undervalued gems I don't think people really know about I mean look look at the volume the volume is very very low but this is a unique value proposition this is fun and useful use of AI it tells a great story you are basically seeing the mimicking of a very very high value product in cryptocurrency but at a very undervalued price now versus another generative AI like neural AI this has got 46x upside potential just to get to where neural AI is right now and the other great thing about it zero is fully diluted at 1.8 million so this hasn't got a ridiculous High valuation if this had 20% of its Supply in circulation then this would be a 400k market cap that is just showing you how undervalued this cryptocurrency is particularly for this type of technology I mean just think about it Sora is going to be one of the most used products and yet you can bypass that by having a product like zero that gives you exactly what you want that gives you high quality as well and most importantly it's got superb upside potential like with all the others I've spoken about this is new it's relatively unpumped it is bottomed and it never has experienced a bold Trend and that's why I believe this one could violently pump when AI season hits the last undiscovered AI gem I have got for you is Octavia AI Octavia AI is an AI agent that is presently worth only $521,000 market cap Octavia manages web 3 communities this can happen for any type of crypto project whether it's gaming AI meme coins you have got an AI virtual assistant that is able to manage manage the telegram manage the Discord so they delete and moderate abusive messages uniting in-house and external models blockchain internet access data and apis so not only is it an assistant for telegram and Discord but the flagship product is actually for crypto research trading and task automation so whatever task that you may have for it any investing any dollar cost averaging any particular price points or breakouts you have got Octavia that can do the trading for you now I have invested in a lot of AI agents very similar ones such as gtii and GTI aai is in the tens of millions and this is still is not as half a million for the technology you get you have got a very low value and potentially highly pumpable cryptocurrency particular is Once Upon a Time this was worth $250 and now it's 5 so it has come right back down enabling for this to have a pump again now this did come out during that big AI pump season back earlier this year so that is why it was able to pump and get so much hype but now that hype died down and there was a bare Trend this has basically been rinsed right down to the bottom and that enables this to pump ginormously a lot of my best multipliers has come from buying cryptocurrencies that were worth in the hundreds of thousands of dollar market cap so for instance even tits for instance that was near 300K so what you've got here is you've got an extremely pumpable market cap and a bottomed chart coming into possibly the most violent all season of all time definitely the most violent AI season of of all time I think that what we saw at the beginning of this year and last year will be eclipsed and made totally insignificant by the pump we are very likely to see in December all the way through to March April time virtuals protocol is undoubtedly one of the top performing AI agent software that exists in cryptocurrency so if Octavia was to get up to virtuals protocol market cap we would be seeing a 29x upside so Octavia to me represents a project that's in a super trend is at a dgen level market cap is new and has botton and lastly tells a great story AI agents are without a doubt one the most bullish narratives within the AI ecosystem you really are getting in right at the bottom on this project and the downside potential does look very very minimal a bonus coin I have got for you which is actually not AI related is Pepe p now I think that this coin is actually extremely fun for its market cap so it market cap presently is a $106,000 now I personally thought Peppa Pig which is what Pepe pig is based on was an English show but actually they have got an American counterpart which just has American voices basically but Pepe pig is meant to resemble Peppa Pig which is a children or toddler's favorite it now what I really like about Pepe pig is that these guys have got fantastic animations look at this you know this is magnificent now if you've ever watched Peppa Pig if you're a parent or something like that then you'll really appreciate some of these videos I won't play them but I can tell you that they've made episodes which resemble Peppa Pig episodes but are crypto orientated so I think this is a brilliant meme coin now this is on the sui blockchain which is a blockchain that at this point has not got many meme coins particularly not many meme coins that have pumped dramatically so as a result of that this one could have decent money flow flowing to it on salana there are millions of coins being created on almost a daily basis actually whereas on sui much less so that means that this one could actually VI for amongst the best sui meme coins presently now these guys are very active on telegram for from what I have seen and their Twitter is very much up to date and their Twitter has a lot of animations on it too so yeah I think this one is a lot of fun to me a 100K market cap is worth putting a bit of money in if it goes nowhere it goes nowhere but if it goes somewhere wow you can make a lot of money you know 100K market cap 1 million is 10x 10 million is 100x 100 million which would be difficult but looking how tits did I don't see any reason why Pepa Pig couldn't do very very similar particularly when when it has got you know cartoons animations that form the basis of its value and also the community which looks like it's growing I hope you enjoyed this AI special let me know in the comments are there any AI coins that are hidden and secret that I don't know about and a low value and I should know about also let me know in the comments what was your favorite project that I spoke about in this video till next time people I've been the Superman you have been amazing and I'll see you next time don't forget to subscribe it is

Some crypto natives seem to do it effortlessly,¬†¬† while others strive to reach that profit margin. Now, you might ask, what did we miss? Are there¬†¬† any important factors we should track? Lucky for you, some parts of the trading¬†¬† mystery will be revealed in today's video. We will have a look at a variety of factors¬†¬† affecting the price of coins and tokens,¬† from supply and demand to some underrated¬†¬† factors to follow as media coverage. This is something that's quite common¬†¬† for both traditional and crypto¬† markets: Market manipulation.¬† In 2021, Tesla announced a $1.5 billion Bitcoin¬† purchase and acceptance of Bitcoin as payment,¬†¬† causing excitement and the BTC price to¬† surge past $60,000 as investors rushed in.¬† However, a few months later, Tesla stopped¬† accepting Bitcoin over environmental concerns,¬†¬† leading to a 5% price drop in the first¬† minutes after Musk‚Äôs announcement and¬†¬† shaking the entire crypto market. While market manipulation could¬†¬† result in five years of prison regarding the¬† stock market, the crypto market has not yet¬†¬† implemented any official punishment. ""The manipulation happens when some¬†¬† groups or users artificially influence the¬† price of a cryptocurrency for their gain.¬† This could be done through various¬† forms, such as """"pump and dump""""¬†¬† schemes, spoofing, or wash trading."" Second, the price can be affected by¬†¬† the attention and exposure that a token or¬† coin received through various forms of media.¬† This November, the SOLANA term got 95/100 interest¬† over time which means that investors and traders¬†¬† got interested in the token. This led to¬† the price of SOL tokens immediately going¬†¬† up and getting out of their $200 zone. How people perceive cryptocurrencies¬†¬† can strongly influence how people feel about¬† cryptocurrencies and can change market trends.¬† Positive news like big partnerships or celebrity¬† endorsements boosts optimism, while negative¬†¬† news like hacks or scams can cause FUD, making¬† users sell their crypto and lowering demand.¬† Another factor is Market Demand and¬† Supply. The value of cryptocurrencies¬†¬† works like any other item people trade. If many people want to buy a specific coin,¬†¬† they are willing to pay more¬† for it, so the price increases.¬† On the other hand, if more¬† people want to sell than buy,¬†¬† the price drops because there‚Äôs too¬† much available and not enough buyers.¬† The next factor is crucial for¬† all crypto holders to focus on.¬† Improvements in blockchain technology or¬† new features can enhance the functionality¬†¬† and scalability of cryptocurrencies,¬† therefore increasing the demand and¬†¬† price of coins and tokens. For instance, Ethereum's¬†¬† blockchain supports smart contracts, which¬† are essential for DeFi applications and NFTs.¬† As these sectors have grown, the demand¬† for ETH - Ethereum's native cryptocurrency,¬†¬† has increased, leading to a rise in¬† its price, such as in November 2024.¬† This surge reflects how Ethereum's¬† practical applications in DeFi and NFTs¬†¬† have positively impacted its market value. ""Another factor is regulatory developments. Each news of regulations in major¬† economies can either boost confidence¬†¬† among crypto users and traders or create fear,¬† uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market.""¬† When everyone is confident to¬† trade in the cryptocurrency market,¬†¬† the price of coins and tokens tends to go up.¬† Vice versa, the price might drop when crypto¬† users stop feeling positive about the market,¬†¬† therefore decreasing the demand. Alright, we hope that you are¬†¬† feeling optimistic and have your confidence¬† gathered to take up your profit in the market.¬† Let us know if there is any factor¬† that we should know in the comments¬† Another time with SEED Learning,¬† would you?

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #mantra #om #crypto","Mantra with the ohm token is on another run yet again it's up 40% today alone let's have a look who's driving this rally who's buying here who's potentially selling and how long could this really last let's have a look at data most people aren't considering let's dive deep into the blockchain data this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at 60 cents roughly so we are up 40% today 93% this week 150% this month and More Than 1,500% This here but there's something interesting have a look at this long-term price chart we tend to pump and dump and pump and dump and now we're pumping again are we going to dump since we're very close to those all-time highs now the price chart doesn't show the entire picture because there is token inflation there's more and more tokens hitting the market so in the price chart we are not yet at the all-time high we're very close in the market cap chart though we have crushed through this we are almost at 3x the market cap almost three times as much capital is now locked up in Mantra or the OM token so really realistically we don't really have a resistance there we are in price disc discovery mode so this is not the first time we talk about Mantra on this channel one month ago I published a video when the price was still at 18 cents you have more than 3x since then we are now at 61 cents and so if this is your first time checking out Mantra then maybe you should be following channels like this I try to be early and I try to publish videos regularly now let's have a look at that onchain data let's look at how many many whales are buying into this how many retail investors are buying into this is this just retail pushing this up or is actually the smart money buying this more this is how I see crypto crypto is both a game of skill and of luck and the more you play the game the more you trade the less important the luck component becomes and the more important the skill component becomes so the people that have a lot of capital the people that have the whale wallets they tend to be the ones that make the better costs on average at least they tend to have a history history of having made proper calls so let's have a look at this here is in the last month the number of wallets depending on the wallet cohort on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 2,000 om tokens at the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail and the number of retail investors didn't grow too much from 1,900 to 1,940 so maybe 2% or so in the middle chart we see the number of medium-sized retails so this is now a 10x in terms of holding compared to the left chart so this is now $10,000 worth of holding That Grew From roughly 300 to 320 so that's already a bit more right that's already 7% or so in the number of medium-sized wallets now the number of Wales Grew From 103 to 123 so roughly 20% growth so what we're seeing here is the larger the wallet the more accumulation happened for the Mantra token in the last month on average it's the smartest money that tended to buy by most this is a very bullish sign this gives us a hint that this might just be the beginning of this rally but let's dive a bit deeper let's look at the mega whales let's look at the people or the wallets that have most of the token Supply let's see how much the top 10 holders hold here is a pie chart of the holder distribution and let's look at the top 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 the top 10 holders hold roughly 50% maybe a bit less than that what others hold we've got some smart contracts that's the top four then we've got three binance wallets another smart contract one unknown wallet another binance wallet so this token is held by the team by the smart contract and by binance what is the balance development of those wallets here is wallet number one tends to accumulate stopped in February middle of February of this year wallet number two also tends to wrong term accumulate in the last few weeks though there was a bit of distribution of maybe 25 million the largest wallet though bought more than a 100 million here's wallet number three also accumulation wallet number four with very few transactions it doesn't have that much of a balance anymore only 50 million so there can't be too much sell pressure from this wallet anymore wallet number five very few transactions rather a bit of accumulation recently so 10 days ago there was an inbound transaction wallet number six tended to sell recently but it's very close to zero number seven accumulated number eight went slightly down nine accumulated 10 is going sideways probably just for Market making so it looks like the mega whales also tend to be mainly accumulating so we see the number of whales growing they're growing much faster than retail we also see that the heaviest of the wallets tend to rather increase their balance again a positive sign now not everything is Rosy because binance is known for manipulating the price and unfortunately we do see a lot of trading volume on binance here so this is the big guys playing with the price they have a lot of token so they probably don't want to crash the price now but have a look at this most of the trading volume happens on binance now this is the spot market and here's the same for the Perpetual Futures Market 11,000 per of trading volume this is relative to the market cap x.com is simply just a Rebrand of binance so basically binance is owning this whole thing we have already seen this on chain so this is by no means the most natural rally but binance seems to be planning something binance has quite a lot of stake in this and so it does appear to me that the price can really further that being said there might be a sharp turnaround at some point so what I believe is the most likely scenario here is that binance is probably going to try to generate a lot of attention with a massive price rally and once enough people use leverage to push up the price higher then potentially they might offload then they potentially might crash the price so it's very very important to take profit here one approach could be to set a trailing stop loss so you don't have a fixed stop loss but you adjust the stop loss as the price Rises so you see the price Rising is getting pushed up by binance but then at some point you increase your stop- loss at some point the thing turns around and then you exit fast you don't wait to get dumped on if this is your first time feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram feel free to join us link is down

on is this Market manipulation who's buying here who's selling here let's have a look at the onchain data most people are not considering so this is the r I'm talking about we are currently at almost $70 per token but when we zoom out a little bit we can see that there were multiple pumps and dumps in the Tor price the recent 50% rally can barely be seen on that chart simply because the pump before was so massive now this is the long-term price chart but have a look at the long-term market cap chart those charts are slightly different Can you spot the difference in the price chart from this peak to this peak we less than doubled in the market cap chart though we almost tripled why is that the reason is token inflation there had been more and more trb tokens floating around the increasing Supply then depresses the price despite a lot of capital getting locked up in in trb and so this is then how that looks like over time this is the circulating Supply and at the beginning that Supply expansion was really a problem from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 the supply pretty much 5x since then the growth is rather small so it used to be a problem isn't a problem anymore that's very important to know because for most altcoins especially recently launched altcoins we have always the problem of token inflation and time is not necessarily on our side with tellor we don't have that problem so if the overall altcoin Market is going up I don't expect a circulating Supply expansion to depress the tellor price now this is not the first video on trb I made one half a year ago relatively successful so the gray area is a typical video the blue line was that first trb video this guy here by the way is one of the founders of DWF Labs that manipulate the price at the time so that's the cause for this pump and dump more videos followed more interest in Tor follow as well just look at this Delta here another video so obviously you guys like my analysis on Tor feel free to check out the prior videos and feel free to follow this channel because I publish videos regularly and try to be early now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not just going through the website in selling you the marketing Jazz I'm interested in the data most people are not considering and so we want to find out what's causing this rally and how much longer this can last unfortunately the Twitter doesn't have a lot of news so this is not a place with any useful information unfortunately the GitHub repository might be a bit more useful so this is a place where programmers submit their code changes we can see how much product development there is and yes there are changes four repositories got changed in the last 24 hours another one here yesterday a lot of activity in the layer repository let's have a look at that here's the number of code changes each day so one and a half months ago there was quite a bit of activity still a bit now but I had a look at the recent updates and that was mainly just unit testing as in making the platform a bit more stable not necessarily new product development so let's have a look at the onchain metrics because we want to know who's buying and who's selling here right when the price is going up then there's obviously more buyers than sellers or at least there's more Capital flowing in than flowing out let's have a look at what retail is doing versus what the whales are doing so there are currently 8,554 holders of the ethereum based teot token and here is the development of the number of wallets over time based on a minimum holding threshold so on the left side we've got the wallets the number of wallets that hold at least 15 trb tokens at the current price that's roughly $1,000 that's what I'd consider small retail for the middle chart we go a 10x for that minimum holding threshold so that's now $10,000 worth of the token on the right chart we've got the Wales that's $100,000 worth of the token very similar holder Dynamics not a lot of buying nor selling there are our ups and downs but overall the number of investors on chain at least is not increasing over time now why do I say on chain I say on chain because a lot of the trading volume of trb actually does not happen transparently on the blockchain initially DWF laabs a market maker held a lot of trb tokens then over time binance took over those tokens bought the tokens from DWF and so now we see most of trading volume happening on binance and also on okx let's have a look so here's the hold up pie chart of TR B here we've got binance here we've got okx another binance wallet here's the balance development of the first binance wallet sometimes nothing in there sometimes a lot that's probably when the manipulation goes up then again nothing then again a lot feel free to check those charts out right feel free to correlate this with the price charts here's the second binance wallet also very similar we go up and down very erratically and here's the okx wallet okx tends to be accumulating but also again with a lot of vol ility especially since beginning of the year okx is stepping up the game so they started buying heavily over here quite ironic isn't it but that's the problem with trb it's in the hands of the very heavy weights it's not organic demand that's driving up prices check out this chart behind me this is the spot market trading volume per exchange binance is of course dominating afterwards comes okx no surprise here they hold most of the tokens we've also got a bit of coinbase Etc but still this is a battle between binance and okx here is the Perpetual Futures Market a ton of Leverage through binance also a bit through okx and buy it interestingly enough as well even though they don't have that much spot so what's happening here is that on the one hand the exchanges hold a lot of the token they can influence the price up and down but on the other hand they also offer bets on the price right through the derivatives through the peral Futures so you can bet on the outcome of the game you can bet on whether or not the price goes up or down with leverage but at the same time the house can liquidate you if they simply want to because again the trading volume on binance alone on the Perpetual Futures was 2.4 billion 24 hours 2.4 billion the market cap is only 180 million so every trb token moved more than 10 times in the last 24 hours that's how much manipulation there is these pump and dumps can go on for a very long time we've seen it in the past we've seen tib go up all the way to $250 if you consider betting on this R which I personally don't but if you consider betting on this R then make sure to protect yourself against the downside risk make sure to have a trailing stop loss at least as the price Rises you want to adjust your stop loss and once the price turns around you want to exit very very quickly because then potentially the price can crash forcing all kinds of people that are with levered bets in there to sell their Tor for cheap if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly also on tellor feel free to also give this a like

Zro Tokenomics,  #layerzero #zro #crypto","layer zero the airdrop everybody had been talking about first crashed down massively but now it's just Rising again like a phoenix From the Ashes let's have a look at some onchain data let's find out how much longer this R can potentially last and in case you haven't yet tried it out maybe you are eligible for the airdrop as well the link how to get that airdrop is down below below this video so this week Z is doing actually quite fine the price went up by almost 4 % we are now at $3.79 and that happened while Bitcoin pretty much didn't move at all but I said things haven't always been that Rosy we initially got a dump from $4 all the way to $250 and now we are reclaiming those initial highs we are currently at a fully diluted market cap of 3.8 billion they currently trading market cap so what's actually currently floating is a bit over 400 million so we can already see something very interesting the circulating Supply is only 11% of all of Supply the supply of layer Zer were roughly 9x from here let's have a look at how fast those token unlocks actually happen because that's in general one of the most important things in any cryptocurrency right we want to see the supply development in order to have an idea where the price might go because price is a result of Demand versus Supply if Supply grows too fast then of course the price might have a hard time time now layer zero is a backend technology that enables to move funds across blockchains so if you've ever used a bridge then maybe layer zero was in the background that's why you might be eligible for an airdrop even though you've never consciously use layer zero you might have done this by using products that use layer zero so let's have a look at the toomics layer zero got a lot of funding a series B supported by Andre and horovitz by seoa by Circle that was at a valuation of 3 billion and 120 million had been raised now we are at a valuation of 3.8 billion earlier funding rounds had similar investors a bit over 2 years ago the valuation was still at 1 b135 million raised and before that it was mainly the crypto ecosystem that put money in at a much lower valuation with much less Capital raised but still in total this is quite a lot of money 263 million raised by by layer zero and all of those investors want to cash out at some point with a profit right ideally with a multiple X profit now the big question is when are they going to cash out and are they going to cash out while we are holding the token also on Cryptor rank doio we've got a vesting page and over here is a timeline but also a chart and this shows us over time how the tokens unlock but instead of using this I personally prefer to use token. unlocks do app and so over here we see that the circulating Supply is actually not expanding up until June of next year so on the short term there isn't too much to worry about the big question is what happens then in those few months before the unlock if there are enough people that bet on falling prices at the time we might even see a short squeeze so that's when market makers and Market manipulators buy up a lot of tokens to force liquidate short sellers right now we can already bet on falling prices of layer zero I don't think it's the best thing to do right now I don't think it makes a lot of sense to bet now on falling prices of Z there's simply too much attention and there is also a lot of ownership by the large centralized exchanges here have a look at this binance has more than 25% of trading volume and the Perpetual Futures Market is also relatively active so the large players don't necessarily have an incentive to push down the price at the moment but as an investment over the next 2 3 4 years it's very very important to keep a close eye on those unlocks very smart people got in with a valuation of $3 billion so $3.8 billion doesn't seem too terrible now the big question is why did those smart Venture capitalists buy at that valuation on chain I don't really see that much momentum so I don't have a clear answer for this yet let's have a quick look at the data so this comes directly from the Explorer of layer zero it's layer zeros scan.com this is the number of messages over time here we've got the number of chain paths also not really doing well the number of protocols that are actively using layer zero and here's a split by different networks or different blockchains on D analytics we see pretty much the exact same data on the left we've got the number of transactions on the right we've got the number of users it doesn't seem like the transactions are concentrated in just a few users right there is a very strong correlation between transactions and user account here the same data again on june. comom so really not that much activity so a lot of the hype recently a lot of the hype is related to the airdrop it's simply just that you can now claim for free your zro tokens and I've tried to claim some unfortunately I did not get any but this is the website it's layer zero. foundation/ eligibility and the link will be posted in the video description make sure you don't just search YouTube for that and follow random links here this for example is an AI generated video that tells you about this airdrop and in here we've got actually a fake link so once you go over here to this fake website which looks very realistic right it looks like the real website once you go to this fake website and then you click on check you don't even have to paste in any kind of address you just click on check it already tells you that you can claim some zro so don't go on websites like this the real website is layer zero. foundation/ eligibility now let's have a look at a few onchain statistics because again Z is available of course on pretty much any chain since it's an interoperability protocol anyways let's have a look at where most of that Capital currently is on chain and let's also see whether or not the people that claim the token are selling off quickly so we've got a version on ethereum with 6,000 holders we've got another version on the binance smart chain with 19,000 holders ERS then there's polygon also 7,000 holders roughly the optimism version has almost 50,000 for arbitrum we've got 4,000 holders for other launch we roughly 4,000 holders but look at this arbitrum has almost half a million holders very very interesting the base chain also has 880,000 holders it's a lot of holders but of course most of those holders didn't buy the token that simply just got it airdrop let's have a look at where actually the capital is because that's a problem with an air right if you simply just have two or three cents of the token you're counted as a holder in that Explorer but when you want to know where actually the capital is moving on chain not on the centralized exchanges it makes sense to put a holder threshold on those wallets as in we want to count the wallets that have at least $10,000 worth of the token or $100,000 worth of the token and so let's go through that this is the ethereum based token on the left we've got a minimum threshold of 200 tokens so each wallet here has at least $800 worth of layer zero tokens in their wallet there now 1,500 such wallets in the middle we go at 10x from that so that's now $8,000 worth of the token on the right we have the Wales that's now $80,000 worth of the token the number of holders is increasing over time but again most of this is very likely airdrop claims here's the same number on the binance smart chain look at how much fewer whale wallets there are there's only eight whight wallets versus more than 200 on ethereum here's a token on polygon same thing very few whales same is true for optimism here's Avalanche and here is arbitrum so arbitrum actually still does have quite a few whales the number of holders is excessive right with almost half a million versus only 6,000 on ethereum even though again on ethereum we've got way more whales here's the number of holders on base also not really that large in terms of Wales so we see that most of the onchain action happens on ethereum and on arbitrum ethereum doesn't have a lot of holders but most of those holders have very Deep Pockets arbitrum has a lot of holders but also some of them have some Deep Pockets again it's 215 whales on ethereum versus 60 whales or so on arbitrum my impression is that layer zero is probably not going to make huge gains because it already has quite a bit of a market cap but it's also unlikely going to crash simply because there's too much vested in interest in a good price performance I believe that short term there will be some price manipulation we've already got the listing on the centralized exchanges we've already got the derivatives the Perpetual Futures on those centralized exchanges and the vesting of those French Capital still takes more than a year from now now I'm not going to buy any Z that's because there's not that much upside but also because I see the General market as not that healthy at the moment because maybe you haven't seen this yet the stable coin market cap isn't growing since April of this year unfortunately crypto isn't expanding anymore there isn't any more Fiat flowing into the system the game is becoming 100% player versus player thus what I'm actually looking at is opportunities to short the alt coins I'm not going to short layer zero because the investing unlocks are too far out in the future but I am shorting tokens that have pretty bad tokenomics if you see an expanding token Supply in a market that doesn't see a lot of new buyers it's very unlikely that the demand can grow as quickly as a supply thus at least the relative variation of a lot of altcoins are likely going to go down relative to ethereum and relative to bitcoin and so that's my central bet at the moment I like to bet on falling prices of charts like this since beginning of the year this went down by more than 60% and it is one of my largest altcoin positions I'm betting on this to continue to fall I made tutorials on how to make money with this on how to short this asset I'm also talking about what asset this actually is that's all available for the premium members so instead of trying to find the needle in the Hy stack the one altcoin that might outperform Bitcoin in ethereum I'm betting on the hstack on the vast majority of altcoins doing poorly I'm betting on this for example to go down and if you want to know how to do this then again there is premium it's the bitcoin.com if your crypto portfolio doesn't yet justify premium there's also a free telegram group the link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting with you over there well cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SGzxKUzsVU,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Avalanche', 'Arbitrum', 'Optimism', 'Polygon', 'LayerZero', 'JUST', 'Threshold',

üü¢What is SHRUB Coin üíµSHRUB Crypto Token Analysis üöÄ,"**SHRUB Coin** is likely a new or emerging meme-based cryptocurrency designed to gain attention in the crypto market through community engagement, humor, and social media-driven campaigns. As with most meme coins, SHRUB Coin aims to attract investors by creating a fun and entertaining investment opportunity, often backed by a vibrant and loyal community. Meme coins like SHRUB usually leverage internet culture and virality to increase their value and appeal.  ---  ### What is SHRUB Coin?  SHRUB Coin likely positions itself as a playful and creative cryptocurrency inspired by internet memes or a humorous concept, focusing on building a strong community that actively promotes the project.

Here's what typically characterizes a meme coin project like SHRUB:  1. **Community-Centric**: The primary strength of SHRUB Coin comes from the active participation of its community. Memes, contests, and social media challenges are key methods of driving visibility and engagement. 2. **Social Media Virality**: Meme coins thrive on trends and viral content. The project will likely rely on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok to spread awareness. 3. **High Speculation**: The value of SHRUB Coin is largely driven by hype, making it subject to significant price fluctuations based on market sentiment and news.  ---  ### Key Features of SHRUB Coin  1. **Tokenomics**: The structure of SHRUB Coin's supply could involve mechanisms like token burns, reflections (rewards to holders from transaction fees), or liquidity locks to maintain stability and incentivize long-term holding. 2. **Decentralized Governance**: If included, SHRUB holders may have a say in future developments or marketing efforts, giving the community a sense of ownership and involvement. 3. **Eco-Friendly Initiatives**: If SHRUB Coin embraces its nature theme, it could introduce eco-conscious initiatives, such as donating to environmental causes or planting trees for every transaction milestone.  ---  ### SHRUB Coin's Potential Use Cases  While many meme coins are initially launched as pure community-driven tokens, SHRUB Coin could expand its utility in several ways:  1. **NFT Integration**: Launching an exclusive line of SHRUB-themed NFTs that could be bought, sold, or traded on popular NFT marketplaces. 2. **Environmental Campaigns**: Collaborating with environmental charities or starting tree-planting campaigns to align with a ""green"" mission and attract socially responsible investors. 3. **Merchandising**: Offering SHRUB-branded merchandise to generate additional revenue and spread awareness. 4. **DeFi and Staking**: Adding DeFi features like staking could provide holders with opportunities to earn passive income, boosting the token's appeal.  ---  ### SHRUB Crypto Token Analysis  #### **Tokenomics Overview:** - **Total Supply**: The total supply is typically designed to be large to create a sense of abundance, with strategies like burning tokens to increase scarcity over time. - **Burn Mechanisms**: To sustain or increase value, SHRUB Coin may implement regular token burns. - **Holder Rewards**: Redistribution or reflection mechanisms may be included to reward long-term holders and encourage loyalty.  #### **Potential Advantages**: 1. **Community Engagement**: A strong, passionate community is essential for SHRUB Coin's growth. Active involvement through social media campaigns can drive the coin's success. 2. **Viral Marketing**: Meme coins can experience rapid growth if they catch the attention of influencers or become part of trending topics. 3. **Environmental Angle**: If SHRUB Coin incorporates eco-friendly initiatives, it could appeal to a wider audience, especially those interested in environmental sustainability.  ---  ### SHRUB Coin Price Prediction  #### **Short-Term Prospects:** - **Market Sentiment**: As with most meme coins, initial success depends on the level of hype and investor sentiment. A successful marketing campaign or high-profile endorsement could lead to a rapid price increase. - **Community-Driven Events**: Announcements of new features or collaborations could also drive short-term price spikes.  **Key Triggers**: 1. **Exchange Listings**: Being listed on popular exchanges can increase accessibility and trading volume, impacting the price positively. 2. **Social Media Virality**: A viral moment, like a trending hashtag or meme, can significantly affect SHRUB Coin's visibility and market performance.   #SHRUBCoin #MemeCoin #Crypto #Blockchain #EcoFriendlyCrypto

the moment money will move this $55 billion will move into xrp and then move into Ada for sure that's that that's how crypto works if I'm saying something this is what I do I live if I'm awake I'm in

you can make money with the project on the other hand there might be some ethical questions here the demo token more than 10x in the last year and yes there is volatility there was no price appreciation in the last month but I don't believe a lot of this is price manipulation because so far this is only listed on coinbase as a centralized exchange a lot of Trading still happens decentralized the token is native to the polygon chain now the worst place to learn about a crypto project is on the website it couldn't be more generic demo is an open and user owned iot Network that empowers people to have a better relationship with technology what on Earth does this mean it means the following you buy a hardware device for $100 or for $300 you pluck that device in your car and then you sell your car's data to dino so Dino then knows how reliable is car a versus car B Dino also knows where you're potentially driving with the car and to top it all off to sell your data you have to pay money first now you're earning Dino tokens while that device is plugged into your car and here's the thing I do believe this can be profitable for quite a while very similar to the helium hotspots right as long as you are early the price of the token is likely going to stay stable somewhat but in order for you to make money new people have to enter the space the main main thing is that the Ponzi scheme has to continue to grow this was true for stepin this was true for helium and there are good numbers that the Ponzi is growing this is the number of pair devices here's the issuance of demo tokens over time and here's the number of users or of wallets that hold the demo token based on their holding right a segregation of holders we're going to look at this in more detail later on in this video now as long as you know what you're getting yourself into here I don't have a huge aversion versus Ponzi schemes the main point here is that you simply have to manage your risk and that you have to exit early now I've taken the picture of the devices of Dino from this video from the video by fire hustle and here's something very interesting fire hustle also talked about the H cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme now while that Ponzi scheme was running I had a very close look at the data because I was invested in the Ponzi and I made some money with it while I was researching H in that case I found a marketing wallet a wallet that would send money to influencers for promoting the scheme now during that hunt I also discovered the wallet by fire hustle fire hustle got $500 to promote hord right that's the beauty of the blockchain all the data is transparent if you simply just know how to use it Now demo is a growing project and the team continues to work very heavily on it right this is the GitHub repository this is where you can see the code changes and just 13 hours ago they had been a change to one of their reposts another one here 18 hours ago yesterday 2 days ago lots of technical progress here's the toomics in the nutshell December of this year will be critical because then we get major unlocks by the team and by VCS but let's have a look on chain what is retail doing versus what are the whales doing this is a tool that I've developed myself it's available for the premium members the bitcoin.com is the link you can find it down below and on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 demo tokens so at the current price that's $577 one could consider this small retail for the middle chart we got one wat of magnitude up so that's a bit over $5,000 worth of the token on the right side we've got a bit over $50,000 worth of the token all wallet cohorts are currently accumulating this is positive we can also zoom in a little bit here right this is a daily chart and it starts in September of 2022 let's just look at the last 30 days again we see accumulation not super fast but a little bit and we do see this jump quite a bit and this is probably due to issuance to the users of the platform people get the token and then they sell it off again people get it and they sell it off again over the longer term though this is going up but it's a very nice interesting zigzag chart right we don't see these kind of zigzags in other charts and this could be a potential Market timing opportunity because these zigzags are somewhat predictable right and so we had this massive dump on the 11th and 12th of January that's true also for the medium-sized wallet C this is also when the price tended to deflate again so that's the beauty of systems like this right they're not designed 100% efficiently and if you know how to use the data you can make a buck from this never forget right this is player versus player you only make money when you're early or when you time the market right I do believe we are still somewhat early but at some point I do believe this will have the same fate as helium had in case we forgot about that price chart we got a nice pump and then the growth stopped and then everything dumped are we currently with demo over here or over here or over here I don't know but I will leave a link to this dashboard down below that you can have a very close look at the growth and you probably want to get out once growth stalls and things aren't going as parabolic anymore if you're new here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you want to get access to this tool over here it's the premium membership that

performers Bitcoin and Solana comparatively held up relatively well what's going on let's have a look at some onchain data most people are not considering let's have a look at the retail investor versus the whale investor who's actually selling here we can have a look on chain but first things first this is where we are now we are at $148 we went down by 33% in the last month Solana only declined by 11% Bitcoin only by 12 now the market as a whole does not look that pretty if you look at the total value lock change in the last month of the top chains Solana comparatively speaking held up somewhat well but all chains are down now this is not my first video on Doc with head I published One 7 months ago when the price was still at 27 CS now even after the crash we are still up more than 5x on that so if you want be early next time here you to subscribe I publish videos regularly on this channel now I've built a tool to figure out what the retail investor versus what the rail investor is doing and this tool is available to premium members it's down below it's the bitcoin.com you can plug in any token into this tool and what we see over here is dog with head on the left side we see the number of wallets that have at least 1,000 wif tokens this tended to grow very quickly in the early days but it seems like the growth has halted somewhat since the middle of April April of this year for the chart in the middle we go at 10x in minimum holding so instead of looking at 1,000 tokens we're looking at 10,000 tokens which by the way at current prices is roughly $155,000 worth that started declining already since beginning of the year on the right side we go another 10x in minimum holding so at current prices that's $150,000 worth of the token that's also declining very rapidly the whales tend to sell off and there's still a lot of them left so we've only declined by roughly 400 wallets there's still more than 800 left so the sell pressure by the Wales is pretty constant the purchases by retail have stopped in April of this year and so let's have a look at the price chart starting in the middle of April what we've got over here is a relative valuation chart so this is the wiif token relative to Solana because that's the idea with alt coins right we want to outperform just Solana and Bitcoin and ethereum because we take on more risk right more risk should be compensated with more return the vertical line that we see over here is when retail stopped purchasing and the relative performance since that it's not that pretty wi underperformed Solana by almost 50% and again that's not due to the small retail investor selling it's not because of the wallets that have $1,500 worth of this it's because of the larger wallets with 15K or even 150k of the token and so here is how I see this I I think investing in meme coins or speculating with mem coins is pretty much a game of Risk versus reward how much potential upside is there how much potential downside is there among the top tokens do with head is already at number two if you order this by liquidity there's only a 2X maximum then doet becomes the largest of the tokens on Solana but there's quite a bit of potential upside right maybe it makes sense to buy rather one of those smaller Tokens The Upside relatively speaking within the Solana blockchain isn't that big the downside however might be quite large because again we still have more than 800 whale wallets to go and the momentum across retail isn't great and so on the face of it right just looking at the price chart it looks like wif is low and of course it's always the idea to buy low and sell high but I think the selling pressure by the Wales is like you going to continue this graph unfortunately is simply too constant there's a constant decline of the people people with a lot of money the smart money is exiting dog with head I know this is not necessarily the popular message right ideally I'd like to say as well dog with f is going to the moon but when we just look at the data right if we try to be as objective as possible we have to answer the question where should the demand come from it's not coming from the Wales and the retail investors have stopped buying as well if you found this useful feel free to give this a like it helps the channel grow feel free to also subscribe I publish videos regularly on various meme coins on this channel in this current market environment I don't try to pick the one winner across a lot of losers I try to rather do the opposite

fueling this R who's buying here who's selling here how is the activity developing is this rally potentially going to continue to last now we are going to look at the data most people are not considering we're going to use Dune analytics we're going to dive deep into the blockchain data but first things first this is the rally I'm talking about we are currently at 25 cents per V token a gain of 73% today a gain of 188% this week this month we more than 4 xed and since June of 2022 we went up by more than 6X and so it's always interesting to see where there's most trading volume because this can give us a hint about data coinbase is the main centralized exchange afterwards comes okx and bit cup we don't see bit cup that often but have a look at this there's also V Drome finance and Unis swap so we actually have onchain data here as well then no Perpetual Futures on any centralized exchanges that reduces the potential for manipulation it doesn't rule it out but at least it reduces that probability now on the application there are some very interesting apis for providing liquidity the application is housed on the optimism chain but before we dive into this let's actually see how much momentum there is currently for optimism here are the top blockchains ordered by total value locked ethereum is of course at number one it grew by 22% in the last month we've got Solana that more than doubled in total value locked we've also got base that outgrew everything else and then have a look at this here's optimism it's lagging somewhat behind right in the last month up only 9% in total value locked here is that total value locked chart for the optimism chain over time looks like we're close to all-time Highs but here's that same chart measured in ethereum so a lot of the total value locked increase on the optimism chain was simply crypto as a whole going up in prices it was not more adop option of the chain so this gives us a bit of a backdrop so we can put this into perspective this is the total value locked off ve Drome first measured in US Dollars and here measured in ethereum not necessarily the best news not necessarily explaining the rally here's the same thing in a bit more detail this is a total value locked based on the different liquidity pools that's directly from Dune analytics so that's du.com here we've got the swap face a bit more erratic tends to be growing somewhat over time which expl exps those High aprs when you deposit in those pools and here's the number of V tokens locked over time so there's not necessarily an increase a long-term increase in staking that can also not explain the price increase so what is it then what is causing the r let's have a look at the demand let's look at retail investors versus whale investors who's actually accumulating here I've built a tool to answer that question on the left side is the number of wallets that hold at least 4,000 V tokens that the the current price that's a bit over $1,000 that's what I'd consider retail those are very long-term charts they start in June of last year in the middle we've got medium-sized retail that's now a minimum holding of 40,000 tokens or $10,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's now at least a $100,000 worth of the token at current prices long term all of the wallet cohorts are accumulating but what happened then in that last month where we more than fourx here are the same kind of charts but only looking at the last month the number of retail investors grew by roughly 15% or so the number of medium-sized retail grew to a similar degree so did the number of whale wallets so there's pretty much broad adoption at similar rates across all wallet cohorts but still this is not justifying a for Xing in price when the number of investors are all just going up by 15% at least on chain and so I'm wondering if I'm simply missing something here is this manipulation or is there some piece of news that I'm missing if you know why suddenly everybody gets excited about vome despite the potentially not so positive momentum except in the price then feel free to comment this down below I want to know all the fundamentals that could be pushing this I prefer betting on data where everything is transparent on chain for example I've bought the extra token recently I've announced this in premium the price is doing quite well since then and I believe just based on the data that we can see on chain just based on the statistics that extra has a bit more groom to grow so I made a related video on this feel free to check it out it's linked over here and of course if this is your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow

here and pulling back on the day very minimally only down about 1 and a half% however this is a little bit weird as it comes out a time where the rest of the market is ripping we have Bitcoin above 65k ether above 2600 bucks both up 6 to 7% respectively and many all coins putting in much bigger gains than that now this could have something to do with the fact that earlier on Twitter somebody actually accused the suie foundation of selling tokens into this rally and we did get an official response from the suie team which we are going to break down in today's episode of the everything crypto show now before we hop into the content just a friendly reminder that I am not a financial advisor nor do I offer any sort of financial advice on YouTube I'm simply here for your crypto news and entertainment purposes and if you do find the videos informative and entertaining please consider hitting that sub and like button and I do appreciate all of the support on the channel so without further Ado we're going to get right into today's allcoin of discussion and that is going to be the suie token once again we have been covering this allcoin a lot more frequently on the channel as there just been a lot going on in terms of its ecosystem and the price action which has been really impressive over the past month um you know we the first time we actually covered suie on the channel was back in September here um when it was just around a dollar and you know from that zone it is up about 117% and I do believe that this altcoin has a lot more potential to run for this bull cycle however interestingly enough as noted at the beginning of the video we actually have SOI consolidating here down about one 1.85% which is really nothing for crypto um the thing that makes it a little bit abnormal is that it's happening on a day where the rest of the market is bright green and um you know considering the fact that SOI is up over double on the month while Bitcoin was pretty much chopping sideways um you know this could just be some consolidation and money flowing from sui into some of these alts here that are now moving today however we did see a very interesting uh tweet actually come out from at light crypto basically accusing insiders of selling and um sui did respond to this which we are going to break down in this video but first I do want to just provide a General market overview as Bitcoin looks like it is potentially finally trying to break out of this downtrending channel that began in March so if we zoom in here we can see that the downtrending channel actually sat at about 65k Bitcoin broke above that as it is now at 66k and um the next area of resistance if Bitcoin does want to continue on this uptrend I believe would be at the $69,000 Mark which is the 2021 all-time high uh and that's where I I think Bitcoin would see some resistance and then above that it would be this cycle all-time high sitting at about 73.8k you know 74,000 if Bitcoin does break back down below this level of uh or just below this downtrending channel here the first area of support that I'm looking at is the $59,000 Zone which has acted as some support here during this this downtrend and then below that we'd be looking at or I'm personally looking at about the 52k level however I have stated on the channel I do believe we are entering the phase of the market where all coins begin to outperform bitcoin and uh if we take a look here at the altcoin market chart so this is the total crypto market cap minus Bitcoin and ether you can see here that it is already broken above the downtrending channel it is just trying to break above this area of resistance at 629 Bill currently sits at 625 bill so if Bitcoin wants to make a run here and altcoins break Above This level of resistance I do believe that we could see a much bigger rally for Q4 and um yeah that's really it when it comes to bitcoin and the General market overview I do want to spend most of this video just focusing on soie as we saw a really interesting tweet come out here from light crypto so he says one thing that I found more and more baffling in the last few weeks is the vertical Ascent of sui with it Quant tupling off of the lows the market is stared for winners and believed that has found one here yet it it all feels awfully chintzy for two reasons that that I think feed into each other yeah he talks about buying soie at a 23 billion fully diluted valuation um and as you can see right now its market cap sits at 6.25 billion but that is with um 2.76 eight billion soie tokens unlocked if all 10 billion were unlocked that puts its fully diluted valuation at that number here 22.6 one billion to be exact uh he's talking about evaluation uh just EV valuation metric compared to Solon now what he says which is more interesting in my opinion and uh something that was disproven which we will break down in just a couple of minutes is that um insiders including what is largely or likely a large Foundation wallet have sold 400 million tokens throughout this runup and he does have an infographic here uh he says they' already begun selling material amounts at much lower prices and are accelerating their they're selling at these more elevated levels it does not bring comfort that the people building this ecos system the people who arguably know this token's value best are unloading hundreds of millions of dollars of token into less informed buyers chasing momentum uh some of us have learned whether now or later as with most of these games where retail buys from insiders there is only one ending and he basically shows his infographic here of what he is claiming are likely to be suie Foundation wallets actually selling um into this rally now we did see the suie team actually respond so following an allegation of sui insiders selling 400 million in tokens throughout this runup sui Foundation would like to respond directly to this individual number one no insiders neither employees of the foundation or M in lobs including the founders uh nor investors have sold 400 million worth of tokens during this period either individually or combined insiders have not been involved in any preemptive selling or violation of lockups and the circulating Supply schedule two while the poster did not provide the wallet address we believe the likely owner of the wallet is an infrastructure partner who owns tokens under a lockup schedule all token lockups are enforced by qualified custodians and continuously monitored by sui foundation and this partner is in compliance so just for some context here if we actually go to token unlocks you're going to understand um you know how the sui token is being allocated so at the moment you know there's 10 billion tokens in total 2.76 eight billion are in circulation meaning that 27.6 3% of the float has been unlocked and yes there is still 72.37 per of the supply that has not yet hit the markets and they actually do also have their unlock schedule over here so you can see that this is where it sits at the moment and you can see as you move up you know how much is going to early contributors how much is going to series A and B investors how much is going towards the Community Access program how much is going towards stake sub subsidies uh Community reserves locked contracts or the M Labs treasury so it is all laid out for you right here on coin market cap and this is the deal when you're talking about a token that did an Ico that raised money yes there are token unlocks that do go to different aspects of the ecosystem and insiders are eligible to sell these at certain points and times okay there was also a very similar argument made for Solana back in 2021 that the dilution and the unlocks would hold it back from from you know seeing a nice run up in the price and uh clearly that was not the case Okay Solana was you know basically you know coined to be one of those VC back tokens and obviously it's a little bit different because of the whole FTX situation as well but um the point is is that yeah there are icos and there are early investors that are eligible to sell at certain points and uh this is all mapped out and the suie foundation is basically saying that any sales are in line with the unlock schedule and with any sort of vesting you know schedules that were made and there is no other Insider selling happening and no selling happening um you know basically in violation of lockups or the circulating Supply schedule so really good of the sui team to basically just respond to that headon and and not let the fud kind of spread on Twitter and as suie has been rallying obviously there are a lot more eyes on the allcoin and on its ecosystem so I do really like that the team just addressed this head-on um and pretty much disproved whatever was being said in that Tweet now is this tweet you know is that tweet uh the reason why soie is down here while the market is up or is it just some consolidation honestly nobody knows the exact reason for this uh this sort of like cool off here on the day I personally think it does just have to do with the fact that yes this allcoin has been a big L performer and um it is just consolidating here as it has already run up over 100% on the month while the rest of the market the majority of the market anyways um has been pretty sideways or just slightly up but soie has been one of the biggest performers over the past month and you can kind of see that visualized here on uh on crypto bubbles you have these meme coins Arrow uh tow up 102% and SOI up 122% so to wrap things up I do want to take a look at the chart as well um now that we've kind of covered just the new segment and and and what suie did in response uh in response to those allegations on Twitter I do want to take a look at the charts and just take a look at this altcoin from a price perspective and just break down what I'm seeing on the candles so for starters if we actually take a look on the daily I want to move us over to a daily here uh we saw here that sui broke right above this all-time high it put back in March at $218 made a new all-time high over the weekend at about $237 and something I've been saying that I do believe you know could be bullish for suie is actually for it to come on back and pull back back test this prior high at $218 and then continue on its next leg up especially if the rest of the market is going to move to the upside as well uh generally speaking back tests of strong areas of resistance is bullish it shows that buyers are now stepping in where once people were selling okay so 218 was resistance there and even on the the uh the daily here you're going to notice back on October 7th it tried to break above 28 got rejected came back down to Buck 75 and then boom broke out above that level so a back test here and then a move higher would be a bullish look for sui in my opinion now the downside scenario you know if we do see suie actually come back down to 218 and break down and not hold it as a level of support the first one that I would personally be looking for would be at about the buck 75 Zone which um this did act as some support here when we saw that pullback after TR to break above 218 and below that I would be looking at the1 51 Zone however I have said on the channel uh multiple times that I am bullish on this altcoin going in to 2025 that is why we have been covering it more here on the channel and will continue to do so as the ecosystem continues to evolve and hopefully the price action develops to the upside as well and that is why we have been covering it pretty frequently on the channel here and will continue to do so so on that note I hope you did enjoy the content in today's video I hope you are all staying happy safe and healthy and I hope to catch you in the next one peace out for

Hamster Kombat Token Price - Hamster Kombat Airdrop Launch Price Analysis,Hamster Kombat Token Price - Hamster Kombat Airdrop Launch Price Analysis  üîî CLICK THIS üëâ https://linktr.ee/pastorbee,"hello everyone and welcome I believe we are all waiting for the amster combat prize so we will know if we have wasted our time mining amster combat or if things are going to go the right way that we initially wished it would go the first thing I want to clarify here is everything I'm going to say here is what I predict cuz I know a lot of people are going to come at me it's like most people are looking for who to use as skip go for the choices that they have made and I'm sorry to sound like this everybody make their choice to follow combat and mine it if you want to be angry with it yes you are right it's Justified cuz I've read virtually 4,000 comments and I now share a sentiment that most people are angry because they spent hours of Mining and they expect something bigger most of us are skeptical already because if the tokens are low that means the price can be low and then this means almost nothing to us but I'm going to predict what it should be based on all the researches that I have done so please I beg of you don't come back and say she you say it's $10 she you say it's $5 this is what they call prediction it's like football matches if I tell you arsal is going to beat Man City 5-1 and they eventually play 22 doesn't mean I'm a liar don't call me a liar don't call me a scam and I'm making that out now it's a prediction at the end of the day amster is going to list what it will list but it's always juicy and more interesting if I can act the mind of amster CEOs and probably follow the market to the point I'm going to be correct I'm almost certain I'm going to be correct about this because I have felt the pause of everyone I'm sure you want amster comeb back to be around $1 per token that would be incredible in most cases when tokens are given the prices are multiplied by that token to get the actual value of that token I hope that's clear so for example if you have 1,000 and I'm going to use this figure a lot 1,000 if you have 1,000 amster tokens given to you an amster list and starts that list from let's say a doar so all you have to do is say multiply by $1 and that gives you how many dollars now that means you have $1,000 this is what we actually want this is the nice scenario that everybody's going to say they are no longer scam and it's very funny that we keep calling amst combat scam a company that already listed a company that give us tokens just because the token is not enough you call him scam it's like calling your husband a thief because he did not give you the equivalent money you asked from him that's not the thing you can say is he responsible very well you can say he's not doing enough as a husband very well but that is a thief or is a scam that's not the right word to use and I see every Community saying that so in normal situation this is what we want one token so for people who have $4,000 $4,000 10,000 I don't even know how that is s it to me you want to collect $4,000 for come back okay now let me settle down because absolutely this is the expectations we have but there are more realities when it comes to mining number one you don't even know the companies that are going to pay there are so many fraudulent companies that you will mine and and they will never ever ever at any point list anything so you get zero so those ones you just it just F away there are some that will use eternity before they will even list and they List have own ridiculous price there's also those and the sad thing is you can't know which one is really good you just have to go through some when dog listed how many of you were certain that dog was going to come up through like they came through I didn't mind dogs and then within 3 months they went and listed they went and people catched up you see that if amster combat's list at 0.07 this was my initial prediction about amster combat and I multiply that by 1,000 of amster tokens $70 you're going to get $70 per 1,000 so if you have four you're going to get multiply by four of these this is what is going to be I'm just preparing a mind I'll tell you what it is and I'll show you the way I tracked it so you can see how I go around searching for informations everywhere so I can get to the truth but there's also another scenario where they can list for 0.7 instead of the 0.07 that gives $70 they could do 0.7 and if you multiply that by $1,700 you see this is a lot I must confess cuz $700 from 1,000 token so for those of us who have about 4,000 then you're going to be talking about how much $2,800 this is even I know is insane that you can get this from a token but I'm sure the reality will hit us in about 2 days and to be very Frank not even everybody's going to take all their tokens cuz here on my amster combat you can see the vestin keeps some of my tokens and they going to keep the 10 months they will release it after 10 months I understand what they doing I explained it in the last video cuz they want to give strength to the coin so they don't want everybody to pull out and then the coin just crashes I'll show you examples of those coins like this telegram mining thing that had already launched and you see how some of them are struggling especially those that did not keep coin you know it's a business for us because we want to make all the money the owners of this platform is a business for them as well cuz they also want to maintain the validity of their coin and also make more money so here you see you won't get everything this is how I got the price I'm going to give to you which is my final price for this listing binance on binance there's a launch poll that is ongoing I participated in it and look at these let me just go to that binance page as I M about one and a half days and all I put here was $150 $150 and look at how much I've mined I've mined 5.41 amster tokens I can claim it now if I want I just want it to be I'll just leave it to the end of it it's ongoing and just look at it we still have about 1 day 15 hours to go there's a possibility I mine up to 40 amster combat tokens with my $150 what does that tell you in 3 days I put $150 and then I divide that by let's say they give me 40 tokens this is about 3.75 that's the worth of what I mind here $3.75 that's what they say it's what they'll give me back my money don't forget on binance launch pool nobody takes your money so I'm looking at it it's looking more like there will be high Revenue coming from amster and please mark my words it might not be on their listings the strategy they are putting in play does not necessarily mean they're going to start from $3 $2 $1 or something they might start with something lower but in about 2 or 3 days it will rise up because one they have already ped some of our tokens which will give value to amster token in the market and there's more to this that we might not know based on technicalities but how did I know this if you notice even from all other projects that has done this thing that amster combat is doing Kin did it look at this four days dogs did it look at this the total air drop that dogs shared was 22 billion kin only gave out 90 million and AmStar combat is giving out 3 billion but now look at this this is the price of all of the tokens that went to launch pool look at them cism is number one look at what he's trading at 0.7 and kin doesn't even have big volume like that he's already trading at 0.7 it actually went up today to almost a dollar cuz I'm trading and I'm checking up on coins and all of that look at dogs dogs is on 0.008 for those people who don't know they said dog gave us everything dog did not keep anything do did not do look look at the coin of dogs it's almost becoming the dust because they gave everything everybody pulled out and then it crashed and it's just recovering a little I know when they listed it went up a little before it started you know collapsing and all and then you can see all other products now I'm just telling you amster has a solid solid plan that can really save these their token in this market when it eventually launches and to understand the pricing that amster Comber can give basically what determines the price of any coin is the market cap and I can go into this let's look at the market cap of dogs I'm using this as an example dogs has a market cap of 451 million meanwhile for tokens that are not up to a billion they are very volatile and fragile in the initial stage they will pretend as if they want to give you profit but then they usually don't have the strength do you know the coins that sustain the market for long and they is very profitable in the long run those are tokens that have high market cap and when I say high starting from a billion how do you know if a token is going to have high market price the amount of token that they have released that is what you multiply by the price that they give that determines what they going to come up with so for amster combat now here they told us that they already have 100 billion AmStar tokens available and then 75% Reserve from the community they have 100 billion 100 billion already of their Amer tokens so whatever price they give it has to one way or the other get them to that 1 billion they can't do it till 0.00 so you know that their market cap is going to be 1 billion and immediately I noticed that that these guys are going to be one of those elusive companies that are going to get over 1 billion market cap I became excited that means their token is going to be a little valuable but they only sad news is in the beginning it will look like it's not and if I go back and look at ktis in as well let's see the information at it has market cap of ctis is 238 million you see they don't have real values like that am combat is going to have more way more than this because of the token it released and so much more in the beginning the price might not be one of the biggest the way I'm saying it but it has the grace to grow based on the market cap and all of these other Cal I see around dogs around ctis and all these other one that I've launched but there are still platforms that continue to give hope about how they're going to launch in the beginning for example if I go to coin codex and then I'm going to search for amster combat here you see what they say is trading with now amsta combat is already trading on here when I click on that look at this amst combat here is trading at 0.1 this a lot of money if you trade this way if by this calculations we put that in perspective if you do 0.1 and let's just do a th000 of these dollars and then we're going to get $100 to be very Frank this looks like something reasonable 0.1 if if we have this I'll be grateful personally but if it is a little lower than this I will still be grateful but I'm going to hold on to my coin because I know in about 2 or 3 days it will go up I am still going to say AmStar combat price for that token will be be t 0.1 and 0.07 just tell me in the comment what you think it will be and then we wait for the 26th of September to receive our tokens but for now buy from me and hopefully we see with the price of amstad that would help you in buying your B and also buying your houses in myama and in Ley",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk8PzZl_SZY,"['DOGS', 'JUST', 'Save',

the phb token is on a nice rally let's have a look at what's driving this are there new products being developed is there a lot of Demand by retail are the whales potentially manipulating let's look deeply into the data most people are not considering So currently we are at $249 we're up 12% today this week we're up 57% and this year we have almost 4X but things haven't always been that Rosy for the phb token look at this in initially there was quite a dump we got a few pump and dumps in between this was no consistent rally and there is actually a reason for that choppy price action that reason is circulating Supply so over time we've seen more and more phb token hitting the market early investors got some tokens the team got some tokens there was also inflation through staking and so let's look at that data in more detail over here we've got the number of circulating Phoenix tokens over time the chart starts in November of 2021 then we got an unlock another unlock now we see that a lot of the supply gets issued through the staking program so here's that staking program depending on how many tokens you lock up you get up to 21% apy now you can already tell from the beginning of this video that I'm not going to bore you with the marketing jazz on the website the main thing to take away here is that Phoenix tries to sell the idea of decentralized AI and decentralized computing power let's have a look at how much more inflation we can expect here is the answer on coin market cap currently 77% of all of phb tokens are circulating so there isn't too much additional Supply anymore now in order to predict the price we need to know both supply and demand we've already looked at Supply to a degree let's have a look at demand are there potentially new developments happening that could create new excitement could create more demand for the phb token to estimate this let's have a look at the GitHub repository so this is the place where programmers submit their code changes where we can see how much work is currently been done unfortunately there isn't too much there was an update on the 9th of April here another update on the 27th of February but just look at this right all of those repositories are pretty much inactive now I always look at relative performance when we get into an altcoin instead of buying say Bitcoin or ethereum when we buy an altcoin we want to get outperformance right why else take on all that risk more risk has to be compensated with more performance thus instead of looking at the US dollar chart let's look at the chart relative to ethereum for Phoenix so in tradingview.com we enter phb usd/ if usdt so this shows us now how PHP relative to ethereum performed over time and yes unfortunately the initial token inflation very much depressed the price the underperformance versus ethereum was almost 70% but here's the good news long term we did see outperformance despite the token inflation now there's two ways to interpret this chart one way would be that we have long-term outperformance versus ethereum the other would be that maybe we are trading somewhat in a range and sometimes we are high sometimes we are low this would indicate that now we are reaching the highs again let's see who's currently buying and selling so here is BSC scan this shows the token page there are 6,25 holders of the token on chain but this number counts all holders even if you only hold one cent worth of the token you counted here so what I think is more important to look at is how many people are there with some kind of significant money how many people have there at least $1,000 worth of the token or maybe $10,000 worth of the token or maybe $100,000 worth of the token what is retail medium-sized retail and the whales doing the answer is in the charts behind me this is from a toour that you can get access to in the premium membership the link is down below the Bitcoin tray.com you can plug in any token into this tool any token on the binance smart chain any token on ethereum Etc and on the left side we see the number of holders that have at least 400 phb tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,000 and this is growing quite nicely over time in the middle chart we see the number of holders that have at least $10,000 worth of the token on the right side we see the number of Wales that's a minimum of $100,000 worth of the token so there's accumulation everywhere and that in theory should imply that the price should also long-term go up right these charts start start in January of 2022 but again over the very long term the price did not just go up and that is due to token inflation as we've already discussed now let's have a look at just the last month where the price went up by 11% here are the same holder charts the number of retail investors also grew by 11% roughly a bit less maybe the number of medium-sized retail grew by maybe 6% and for the massive Wales they're simply just some random volatility we lost one whale over the last month so it appears that onchain a lot of the price movements happen due to retail accumulating retail buying into the AI hype now let's have a look at the largest holders let's zoom in a little bit what we've got over here is the holder pie chart and we see that binance holds a lot of the supply 32% there another binance wallet over here 24% and another one over here 1.3% there's also another unlabeled wallet but when we scroll down here we see that unlabored wallet is a contract wallet here's the balance development of that contract wallet over time I've got a feeling I haven't looked into this into more detail I've got the feeling that this is a staking contract sometimes people stake sometimes people unstake and so that would imply that roughly a third of the tokens are actually stake now let's have a look at what binance is doing with the token let's also have a look at what maxc is doing with the token is binance accumulating is binance selling off what are they doing here is the first binance wallet it goes up and down and up and down no real buying no real selling here's the second binance wallet in aggregate rather bought and here is the third binance wallet which seems to have most transactions that's probably the customer funds those other two wallets are probably for Market making here's the Maxi wallet accumulating over time and so this is then how that reflects on the trading volume the vast majority of trading volume happens on binance the issue is that a lot of trading volume happens also on the Perpetual Futures also on binance that's not good what this means is that binance can manipulate the price right it can push the price up or down but at the same time binance also offers bets on the price so enough people bet on Rising prices on the Perpetual Futures Market binance can potentially crash the price and vice versa so if you're getting into Phoenix be aware that you're playing directly against a centralized exchange directly against a very very strong player I do believe that the game with the phb token is somewhat riged I do believe that you would be betting on the sports game while the sports betting house has also bought the referee if it's your first time here Fe you to subscribe I publish you this regly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow feel

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.,"within 24 hours we all have doubled our money from Ray coin I hope you have taken a trade in this toen if I just show you over here yesterday when I made a video on this toen it was available less than 10 cents what happened since we bought this if I show you over here since we bought price double man it shocked the world it's pumping with back to back marabo candles man I show you it's pumping non stop man what happened in the past so initial stage it launched if I open the graph in one time frame it was being trade approximately $5 us and from there we have seen a massive sell off and it dropped badly it found the bottom it was fluctuating a range bound near about 6 cents it pumped a lot and then when I saw 48 hours back from I made a video on this to that it's about to go up byy now if you'll watch this video which I made on rare you're going to find that I talked about this token that exactly buy at current price and since we bought this was our buy and I'm getting lot of like messages from across the gr from different continent that people want to join the group I okay I have a group I have an announcement to make man I have a group there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I gave a coin that buy arkm 40 cents was our buying price few days back from now we bought arkm what happened since we bought arkm if I show you since we bought arkm price doubled if you haven't joined the VIP most of you people who are watching this video you have joined the group if you haven't and in in some worst case then this DM me on Whatsapp I'm going to add you in my VIP two signals every single through which you can make daily profit don't Jo right right away because coins are exploding to different way Al together man let's come back to topic to man so we bought it over here 6 cents 7 cents we bought it over and since we bought it pumped Forex man your $10,000 you could have turned into $440,000 in profit with rare because it's pumping when I read this token it's pumping nonstop I found it's a legit the biggest token we have on nft Space it's an industry Beyond a project it Formed an an industry this year and if I tap on their official website I just show you it's like providing so much man you can see different Arts form which are selling in th000 Bucks uh $5,000 like hell lot of money people are trading man so you're going to find there are people to they are doing sales in $220,000 in a day man and people from across the globe you guys can check over here man insane massive money people are making they are ethereum which you want to find they atart form you want to find which is like being trade over ethereum so if you are professional but like I mean professional at your work then you're supposed to use super rare man their nft space just connect your wallet and just start trading but you need knowledge for that it not happen impr prompt if you think you can do it no no no it'll take some time you have to go through from that process man so yeah uh okay how we should go over it we have taken a trade we have made money and few hours back from now before I slept like I I made a video that just take a trade man and since since I would say morning man it pumped 50% again man so it's pumping nonstop man how we should go what going to buy it already pumped now we have to wait now if you are buying this token you have to understand and most people lose money in financial Market is it worth buying the top of course not if you're going to buy you're going to become exit liquid what does that mean somebody has to lose money let's like put this way somebody has to lose money to make money in the market you want to make money but if you are buying the top people like us who bought the tip we want to sell the top and you guys will be buying the top man so like you going to become the exit liquidity which I don't want any one of you people who have ever followed me I don't want anyone of you to lose money in the market so just have some patience once price will be back to 6 cents good to go if it drops less than 10 cents good to go but if you are buying mark my words I can write it down in a piece of paper you're going to lose everything in the market if you are buying above 10 cents man please don't do that resist yourself 9 to 10 cents is the max man if you are buying Above This level no no way you're going to make money in the market no way in the last 10 years I haven't come across someone who made money in the market but buying the top none buy now I have 10,000 like contacts on WhatsApp I'm talking to people from different continent I haven't met a single person on Earth who made money by buying the top none by now so if it drops up to 10 cents less than that right make the most money out of it but if you are buying now it's pumping it's in top G it's trending everywhere in the world you're supposed to buy you should have bought it like when I made a video on this to a day back from now multiple videos if you if you'll check just search Rare Coin you're going to find my 5 10 videos on this token so if you haven't bought yet it pumped now just leave it be professional man if it's at the buying price good to go buy and make the most money out of it as it already pound from the buying price we cannot buy and if you are buying you will lose no way you're going to make money so if it drops up to 10 cents less than that try to accomodate for the bull market price prediction for people who bought this to I would say sell 30% at least 30 40% book profit because you have made over 400% profit and now if you are not selling a bit of your like money that you have made out of this token then you gambling then which I want suggest that sell 40% 60% keep in hold put a stop- loss 18 cents and let it like fly man put a stop loss 18 cents if I draw a trend line to explain you this should be your stop loss so if it hit your stop- loss at the worst scenario it should be sold man if it drops it should be sold what going to happen next man if it breaks like this level the ultimate resistance which we have for R 25 cents price is going to fly man price is going to fly differently if it if it breaks the ultimate resistance 24 cents man it going to stand out it going to stand out it going to pump approximately up to1 us you're going to make a hell lot of money out of here is it okay from where we can buy I have talked about the buying price when to buy if it drops 10 cents less than that okay good to go but if you are buying big no man just wait for some time okay let's talk about few fundamental part about this market cap ain't much man $158 million of market cap less than a billion coins we have in the market which ain't much the the niche is collective nft I have shown open the profile everything Marketplace fashion art platform it's providing as well not Sol it's working on uh nft space beyond that it's working so many things man metaverse web3 cross chain price prediction $10 from where we can buy it's available everywhere in the world if you have the access of Internet you can have this token you can buy from binance coinbase Kraken a everywhere in the world I wish you all best have a nice and if you haven't joined the private group the VIP man that's all you need this is my WhatsApp number okay some people say Okay I I take trade in large cap Bitcoin man Bitcoin this group is all you need man Bitcoin we bought at $1,000 since we bought we are sitting at 3x profit at the moment if you haven't joined I guess you all know what you should be doing I'll wish you all the best have a nice

attention follows price movement so whenever a price Ries whenever a token goes up in price then we see a lot of people looking at that token however book of meme has a lot of attention while the price couldn't be more boring have a look at this I made already two videos on book of meme a typical video is here in Gray that's how much usually a video gets in views the first book of meme video though performed this quite a lot and it still gets traffic up to this day this is a video that's 72 days old the second video is 66 days old also a pretty strong outperformer and that's all to be seen with this price action I couldn't think of a chart with a more boring price action there is an explanation for this though and that explanation is behind me this is all the tokens on the Solana chain ordered by their liquidity pool size so ordered by how much capital is bound up in the token and book of meme is at number two and so in a market where the Solana chain tends to attract a lot of capital where the growth is relatively steady so where the one month change in total value locked was more than 20% it's second only to the new blast Network that's very very risky in such a market it makes sense to look at the top coins now let's have a look at the onchain metrix let's have a look at how many new investors are getting into book of meme so this is the last 30 days where book of meme also pretty much traded like a stable coin we had three days where the number of first-time Traders exceeded the number of recurring Traders quite a bit you do want to see as many days where firsttime Traders exceed recurring Traders as possible because that shows us that new people get in right this shows us that the price can potentially rally at some point here's the number of token transactions per interval so this is the last 168 hours a lot of activity at the beginning but it's still not really dying down there's still quite a bit of trading going on now this here is my favorite chart this splits up the number of transactions based on different wallet sizes so small retail here in purple is the wallets that have less than $11,000 of the B token mediumsized retail have between $1,000 and $10,000 large retail have between 10,000 and 100,000 and Wales have more than $100,000 worth of the token now what we can see here is that the 6th of May was pretty much dominated by the larger players not by small retail let's have a look at the 6 of May that's over here so it looks like when the large players are pumping the price and for such a big asset such a pump is only around 10 percentage points when it's only the large players that buy in then that could be potentially manipulation sometimes though for other tokens what we see is that the whales tend to buy several days in a row in those kind of cases they might have an information Edge but it looks like book of meme is simply just a very very stable asset the super heavy weights have already sold off so that happened in the middle of March and since then it's the smaller guys that took over there might be a bit of manipulation of the token happening and that is because there is trading volume on centralized exchanges as well and those tend to be used for Price manipulation so 55% of all of trading volume happens on binance 133% of all of trading volume happens on gate.io and of course we've also got quite a bit of activity on the Perpetual Futures market so on the lever bets on the price now when looking at the US dollar variations of Solana tokens unfortunately we don't see very clean Trends because there is a lot of expansion and contraction of the General market when Bitcoin and ethereum is going up then of course Solana goes up as well pushing up all kinds of meme coins as well but what's very interesting is to look at the idiosyncratic price movements as in what's happening with the Solana denominated price and here we do see some structures this is book of meme relative to Sol and it appears we've got a bit of a floor here and maybe also a potential ceiling so measured in Solana book of meme can go down maybe by 10% but it could also go up by 24 a relatively tight trading range and that is somewhat expected since the liquidity is already that large it takes a ton of capital to move the price here have a look at this this is Bonk relative to Solana it has a relatively clean floor and it does have some what declining tops here the risk of more than 40% versus the potential reward is maybe not that great but here's something that looks more attractive this is Cat in a dog's world so another very large meme coin on Solana here we are approaching a very nice support so the risk is very minimal the potential upside is large with maybe 170% or so it seems like those mem coins have trading ranges relative to Solana and the risk profile is very comparable so here's book of Meme here has cats in the darkg world and Bon is at number 10 a lot of trading volume for Bon now happens on centralized exchanges not anymore on chain the market cap is huge the liquidity on chain isn't that big anymore and so just based on those relative variation charts I think book of meme looks somewhat interesting I do think though that the Mew token so cat in the dog's world looks a bit better it's always about finding the best RIS to reward and to have some kind of strategy when to exit right you don't just want to buy into a meme token and then hope for the best it's better to have a plan to have pred decided when to potentially buy more and when to potentially exit if it's the first time here feel you to subscribe I publish this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow there's also a free telegram

now what's going on oh my God it's extremely bullish man technically chart has been a bullish it it pumped with back to back marabo candle it pumped a lot healthy pullback it was making higher high higher high and then it it made a bit of higher low at the this level then again it made higher high again it made higher low bit then higher high then higher low then higher high now it's making higher low it going to make higher high technically chart is indicating extremely bullish this token reminds me of a one coin Back in the Day 2021 three 3 4 years back from a coin called GMT which launched in the market it had the same pattern and it pumped over 1,000x man this token and P and UT my price prediction $10 I remain with my prediction man $10 will come into the picture but for shortterm $2.5 was our Target and it achieved $2.5 yeah it's just the beginning more pump is on the way I want to give all the information about pnut okay but it reminds me of a GMT man and and dude what happened to this token man it launched pumped a lot man like it was making higher high higher low higher high higher low and it popped over 100x from s from s it pumped up to $4.2 man it shocked the world totally man so we we going to see same same sort of pump in PN UT healthy pullback will come into the picture but we all are extremely bullish price going to pump a lot okay before we Deep dive into p and UT I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit on the screen you can see my WhatsApp number send a message on WhatsApp I'll be adding you into my VIP say hi on WhatsApp I'll be adding you I give a coin that buy wif 2.5 what happened since we bought if I tap on the more we double how money within 24 hours we double out money from wif if you haven't joined the VIP this is my WhatsApp number even act the most pum token in the world Act 80 87 cents within 24 hours we Double L money haven't joined the VIP this is my WhatsApp number man my trades are 98 to 99% accurate I have been doing for a decade now and yeah I I personally take trade every single day and I let people know man if you want to work with me just DM me on Whatsapp okay how we should go about this token man it pumped a lot it pumped a lot man and I would love to take a trade at like at like $1.2 to $1.1 at this level we can afford to buy there's a huge gap and if it drops it going to drop a bit like a big a big why purely because uh it pumped a lot but it'll take support it ain't done it ain't done but like okay like GMT man it pumped a lot a healthy pullback which will come into the picture man which will come into the picture as I opened the graph in a smaller time frame if I tap on one time frame there's a no graph but with GMT we have opened the graph in one time frame so price will come down like this what I'm talking about you're going to find 1.2 and then it want to takes off because now when we open the graph in one day time frame now see there is a no retracement with GMT in one day time frame there's a big pullback like from from three to like it came down up to two so so I'm saying the same man from two to it will come up to 1.3 one like bit of healthy pullback that's a part of it with all the currencies it applies to all the cryptocurrency we have in the world it's a big one in date so how we should go about it one time frame sorry 1 hour time frame we'll wait we'll wait for sometime sometime up to 1.2 to 1.4 in this levels you're going to buy if you haven't bought yet wait for some time if I draw a horizontal line 1.2 would be the perfect buying level man once it'll be back to 1.2 I going to go with big money man I'll be taking a trade with big money over here at 1.2 price prediction we have for shortterm $10 and for long-term 5050 don't miss this token or otherwise like later on you will realize that you missed an opportunity because all the currencies which launched in the market like Bon the the previous coin which got the biggest platform in the world binance and in Sol ecosystem Bon Ray they they shock the world and now we have two currencies uh in like in so ecosystem AC and pnut we have double triple fourth time we have made money out of this currency and I was very much confident if you have watched my content I didn't say it might go up I was like it will go up this is my target it's about to go up like that okay it'll be back we're going to buy 1.2 good to go uh if if it breaks upside 2.5 then we can buy okay fine if I draw one more horizontal Ray to give one one more buying level if if price breaks if price breaks $2.5 breaking 2.55 take a trade 2.55 um put a stop- loss 2.3 price prediction $10 I wish you all the best leave your thoughts in the comments your views you have regarding pnut and if you haven't joined the VIP on the screen you can see my WhatsApp number man just DM me I'll be adding you let's work together man make money in the market have a nice day cheers guys",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkWCR6qfLkc,"['GMT',

going to look at Hidden data that most people do not look at or that most people don't have access to you're going to find out how long can this rally actually last this is the rally I'm talking about we are currently at 18 cents roughly up 70% in the last week alone in the last month we more than three x in the last year we more than four xed now what's behind that who's buying who's selling what's the development around the project I'm not going to bore you with the website and sell you the marketing Jazz and all of that this is not how we can get an edge in crypto right we want to get the information that most people do not have or at least that most people aren't looking at here's one thing most people aren't looking at this is the GitHub repository so the platform where programmers submit their code changes so we can look at activity and unfortunately on that website we don't see much activity recently so either they have have changed their GitHub or there is nothing happening the last update was in February of last year almost one year ago now here's something super ironic the location of this GitHub repository is Hong Kong now I'm living in Hong Kong and in Malaysia and so I accessed the website via Hong Kong and look at this you can't access the website through a Hong Kong IP the products and services on this website are not intended for individuals in your location so the GitHub is in Hong Kong the website can't be accessed in Hong Kong pretty strange now let's continue our Quest on data that most people aren't looking at let's have a look at how much capital is locked up in the project this is mantra's total value locked over time and of course at the beginning we had quite a pump but then the bare Market also dumped the price quite a bit now we see a recovery but we still far off from those all-time highs let's zoom into the recent action from from the bottom of 3.8 million we went up to now 15.9 million now what's behind this rally of more value being locked on chain I've got an explanation but let's first find out why did the total value locked actually crash in the first place and why did the price go down in the first place because that rally that we are seeing here is just the last year when we actually zoom out we see this rally with a massive massive decline afterwards what caused the decline this here might be one of the reasons Mantra has a lot of investors a lot of venture capital went into the project and thus we are facing this issue the number of circulating om tokens Mantra has an ever expanding Supply and that Supply increased by almost 8X in less than 4 years in the last year alone the supply grew by 34% according to missouri. and that's how the game works right price is a result of demand versus Supply if the supply grows very fast and demand cannot keep up and of course the price has to go down longterm here's the 5-year emission schedule according to a medium article on Mantra da an article that had been published in August of 20120 this matches with misari doio we start at 10 and something million we are now at our 800 million and it appears that the growth here never stops the growth comes from referrals from reserves and interesting enough from staking rewards staking rewards okay so maybe we can protect ourselves from that inflation to a degree by staking let's have a look at the platform this is app. mantra. finance and this is the staking rewards you can get on the various blockchains so Mantra is available on ethereum on the binance smart chain and on polygon and on the binance smart chain you now get 40% apy but obviously this is fluctuating but it appears that that you can pretty much remove all of the dilution by staking on chain that's good right especially if there's not too many people staking and here's the potentially nice part of all of this it does appear that there's not too many staked Mantra tokens because look at this Twitter announcement only 11% of Mantra tokens are actually being staked so if you're part of those 11% you are benefiting from the dilution just to drive home how bad token infation actually is have a look at this chart behind me this is the Mantra token relative to ethereum so there's a ton of correlation in crypto when Bitcoin goes up altcoins go up when ethereum goes up altcoins go up but when those main tokens go down then the altcoins go down as well and to remove that macro impact we can just look at relative valuation and the Mantra token underperformed ethereum by 95% and since that token inflation stopped this is when om was able to outperform again isn't that fascinating it's super important to look at the toomics to look at vesting schedules especially when a project got a lot of initial funding now again this channel is about finding data that most people do not have access to what I'm always wondering is who's driving the rally when a price goes up who's actually buying is this small retail or is this the Wales or is this potentially manipulation by the centralized exchanges let's have look on chain and this is a bit more complex for the Mantra token because we've got three different versions we've got a token on ethereum another one on polygon and another one on the binance smart chain now I have built a tool to distinguish retail investors from whale investors this tool is available for the premium members it's the Bitcoin tray.com the link is down below this is where you can get access and a tutorial video for this tool and on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 om tokens and this is a very long term chart starting in 2020 for the medium chart we go one order of magnitude up so that's now 10,000 tokens for the right chart we look at the whales 100,000 tokens so each time it's a 10x from one another we see how the number of wallets is declining each time and if you're wondering how many dollars that is 1,000 tokens so the left chart is $180 roughly so $180 $1,800 $188,000 now this is a long-term chart and we just want to know what happened in the last month right why did the price 3x so here we've got the same charts just for the last month the Wales didn't do anything in aggregate so did medium-sized retail and small retail did some accumulation now did you notice something here let's have a look at these long-term charts the number of Wales hit an all-time high they purchased massively before this month they purchased two to three months ago the number of whales increased by 50% 2 to 3 months ago it didn't increase in the last month but it increased two to 3 months ago that increase was way more muted for the smaller investors so again we see how the whales tend to make the better calls they bought roughly over here and they took advantage of this entire rally without driving the rally they didn't buy in the last month they bought before now when we look at the polygon based token and at the binance Smart chain based token we see way less wallets most Capital really is on ethereum this is where the action is this is the charts we should be focusing on but then how is it possible that the price Rises like this if the whales are currently not buying if they bought all before my strong strong suspicion here is that we've got manipulation by the centralized exchanges especially by binance and we can see this also on Twitter the Twitter account by Mantra Finance was bragging about a trending hashtag the hashtag is not Mantra Finance the hashtag is not Mantra crypto the hashtag is om which is a ticker symbol of Mantra Finance om on binance now why would that be trending probably because people at binance wants it to Trend so maybe there is some manipulation on Twitter as well maybe some Bots are generating that kind of trending topic because why would something be trending worldwide when the number of retail investors that barely hold 00 only went up by roughly 70 to 80 wallets it doesn't make any sense and this is also confirmed when we look at the trading volume across centralized exchanges have a look at the table behind me in the last 24 hours 68% of all of trading volume happened on binance only 1.75% of trading volume actually happened on chain on Unis Swap and that's on ethereum this is where most capital for the token for mantra is being traded so what's the tldr here Mantra Finance had been massively bought by the Wales 2 to 3 months ago Mantra Finance did not go up in price much but now that the price is rising the Wales aren't buying more the number of whales is simply just staying steady they take advantage of this rally there's manipulation happening on Twitter there's manipulation happening on the centralized exchange and that's why the price is going up the price is going up because a few key people at binance want it to go up and do I dare to predict how long this price will go up no I don't because I do not have a special device to look into the brains of those few important people for me it's all crystal clear for me this is all manipulation I stay away manipulation can stay on for quite a while though we have seen this for example in Tor in the trb token if you do decide to be part of this party then at least set a trailing stop- loss so as the price Rises adjust your stop- loss and when the price corrects then get out quickly if you're considering to hold this longterm then please please stake the token on chain otherwise you get diluted heavily away 30% we've seen this that's how much the demand has to grow every single year just for the price to stay stable right so you do want to stake it you do want to get your Mantra tokens and you want to be protected from that inflation most people are not almost 90% do not stake you want to stake if you want to hold this longterm if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very very much appreciated as well it helps the channel

appreciating there are several political tokens we're going to focus on one of them in this video so this is the current state Trump has a 53% chance of winning Camila Harris only 46% and this is a

going to discuss the website because the website doesn't give us any Edge we want to figure out who's actually driving the price we're going to look at onchain analytics first of all the token we're going to discuss has 26,500 followers on Twitter on the xplatform it's got 11,000 subscribers on Telegram and it's got 21,000 holders on the ethereum blockchain directly now coin gecko doesn't just call this the mega token it calls it the mega head token to make a distinction because besides the mega head head token there's also the mega Trump token which is also on ethereum but which is besides ethereum also hosted on the binance smart chain on Solana and on base and that one has a much larger market cap of 245 million so here's an overview of different politically motivated tokens Mega head is roughly 1/4 the size of Mega Trump by the way there will also be a video on the mega Trump token I'll publish this just a few hours after this one if you don't want to miss that feel free of course to subscribe now Mega head is not just on ethereum it can also be bought on centralized exchanges like gate.io Mexi xt. comom which by the way is affiliated with binance and there are even levered bets so derivative products Perpetual Futures on the token as well with some trading volume on Maxi the token is the 12th largest within the ethereum blockchain in terms of liquidity when we look at the trending tokens and the holder development is actually quite interesting what you've got over here is the number of wallets based on different C ports so at the left side we've got the number of wallets that have at least 5 million Mega head tokens which is at the current price pretty much $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle we go a 10x from the left chart so that's now minimum $10,000 worth of the token for the right chart we go another 10x so that's now a minimum of $100,000 worth of the token now what do we see here we see that retail bought quite a bit and accumulated up until the end of May of this year we then saw pretty much much net holding no big change when we look at the mediumsized wallet so the ones with 10K worth of the token we can also see early accumulation but we can see way more profit taking along the way so roughly 1/3 of the holders left the token in the span of 2 to 3 months the Wales all got their tokens on the very first day so we don't even see accumulation across several days they bought in very very early the number of such wallets got cut in half dur the bare market and it's now recovering not as quickly as medium-sized retail but still all wallet cohorts at least since the beginning of October are buying now let's Zoom a little bit in and let's have a look at what happened just in the last month so initially things weren't that great but then something changed roughly around the 3rd of October the 3rd or fourth of October which by the way also coincides when Trump gained quite a bit of ground against CA Harris have a look at the holder distribution those are the same kind of cut offs but this time we only look at the last month and we've got hourly data here see how this turned around pretty much at the beginning of October a lot of buying by retail and by the medium-sized wallets and also by the Wales but especially the center they seem to be driving this most they have sold the least in September and they are now at new all-time highs now I find it important especially for meme coins that there is a growing investor base that more and more new people jump onto a token and so I like to look at the new traders that enter a particular token so that's the beauty of the blockchain we can see what are the existing Traders versus the new Traders and again we can split this up have a look at this on the left side we've got the number of new users per day and this shot up on the 4th of October and the fourth of October was over here right the vertical line is already the 5ifth of October so after all of those new investors jump in we have seen a rally of Almost 100% we can also see in relative terms right when we just look at returning users relative to new users how this peaked again on the 4th of October by the way all of those charts come from a tool that's available to the premium members so I've developed this tool it's available at the bitcoin.com link is down below if you want to analyze your favorite altcoin feel free to check it out there's a lot of value to be discovered and I believe onchain metrics really do make a difference seeing such a spike in new users is definitely very very positive now there is a bit of a caveat though right and that's simply how much risk there is in meme coins in general because historically the mega hatch token has crashed quite a bit by more than 93% and again that is because the whale sold and sold did medium-sized retail the small retail people rarely sell they are the ones that get crushed during bare markets like this it's the big smart money that exits at the top and again that's why I like to look at this kind of split up right I want to see what are the whales doing are they dumping or are they buying and currently this looks pretty healthy and so there's two ways to look at this right on the one hand there's a potential danger but on the other hand we have seen and there's no token inflation here we have seen prices that were more than 200% higher than the current price and again relatively speaking Mega hat is rather small there is potential upside a 200% increase or a 3X would still keep it below Mega Trump and very likely there is a strong correlation between the two right so if Mega head goes up then Mega Trump is probably going up as well I am going to publish updates on both Mega tokens regularly on this channel I will publish the mega Trump token video very soon as well feel free to subscribe feel free to also give this video a like it helps the channel grow in case you've

Dodge your 10,000 you could have turned into $60,000 all the information about act p and UT you'll be finding in my VIP join right now this is my WhatsApp number send a message hi hello on WhatsApp I'll be adding you into my VIP man let's come back to topic how we should go about act We Are One breakout we see this what happened it launched um it was on accommodation phase and then it tried breaking these levels it it tried going up could not break it it Formed double top and then price dropped a bit if I draw a horizontal line to to make it evident man okay from here price dropped and now it's taking some time it'll be trying twice so I want to like round this it tried breaking this level that was 0.53 it could not break so it came down now it's on accommodation phase it'll be trying now twice to break once we see closing like this see closing closing is the the deciding factor closing means breaking out closing above the resistance which will leter turn on to support if we see Breakout out like this this this level which is like known by the name of resistance that will turn into support okay fine got it and after that price is going to pump $10 will come into the picture but we have to wait now I hope you guys are getting my point when we see rejection what happen normally price drops like normally price drops a bit like this a bit like this and then it's right that's how crypto Works bro if I'm if I'm saying something it's 100% accurate you can ask anyone in the world it doesn't matter any Financial if you have any friend in financial Market show this video to that particular person man and that guy will say that this guy is 100% accurate yes that's how I have made my Millions man in the market in the last 10 years we have to wait we have to when to buy after breaking out 0.53 54 take a trade price going to pump nonstop man it going to breaking out and going to pump a lot in upcoming Days by the end of this week I'm expecting $5 to $10 man massive massive move is on the way W to buy after breakout 0.5 for good to go but if you are buying now nobody taught you the B if you are buying less than 54 bro you are a newb you're going to lose everything in the market you are lacking knowledge you why you are buying oh I think price will go up you will lose you deserve to lose money why because you are gambling with your money you are buying because oh I think price will go I'll buy I'll make money no you will not why you are buying s me a single reason how many ways do we have in the market to make money do you have an idea about that no I don't know so so you are lacking knowledge you don't have experience how you going to make money in the market how like by putting your money into something oh it's going up I'll buy I'll make money the no you will not you will not like you will lose because you are doing opposite of what you supposed to do you have you supposed to go right but you are going wrong you're going like left so that's the wrong part that you are going man you are buying when you're supposed to sell don't do that man we have to wait I see how many ways do we have we have two ways to make money in in the market after breakout 0.54 take a trade put a stop loss 0.48 price prediction $10 that's the first way of making money in the market after breakout the as the first way other way once it found the bottom once it found the bottom we're going to buy after that I'll let you know once it found the bottom I going to drop an update in my VIP that I'm putting my $100,000 into AC C because it's a big one I cannot afford to miss Frankly Speaking if you ask me yeah I going to go with big money man maybe $100,000 yeah it's a big one I cannot afford to miss it's an opportunity we have in our hands it'll take some time maybe I going to buy at the dip I'll play professionally bro I'll not like the I I'll not put my money oh go up bull bull like bullish bull no no no no no no not man professionally either we're going to buy the dip and then price going to takes off that's the first way or maybe after breakout I hope and if you are following my videos firstly you are not losing your money you're buying exactly at the right time you are making money in the market that's how my all trades I'll never like I'll show you just name a coin in the comment and in next video I'll show you in my VIP we have taken trade in all the currencies we have in the market and you're going to find one thing that the last time when we took a trade in any coin in any coin it was at the bottom it was at the bottom if something goes above buying price what I do but see this is something which I do I have been doing for a decade now for a decade so when we buy something we buy at the dip if something goes above the buying price I don't touch I don't chase the pump no I'll be buying at the dip that's how you're going to make money in the market always and if if something goes above buying price even if it goes 100x I don't give a we have so many currencies in my watch list I like like Dodge Dodge this token Dodge I have been following I have been eyeing for 9 years now for 9 years I have been following this token then I was like okay it found the bottom if I open over here tap on this Ling guys just hold give me a minute man give me a minute see when we when we bought Dodge buying price was 0.06 68 we bought it over here 0.0 68 over here over here we bought at at this level and then it pumped we made money that's how you going to make money in the market okay with Ray we bought 0.17 over here at at the bottom at at the bottom that's how we have made money out of the store that's how you're going to make money in the market I lost my money initial stage 4 years initial stage 6 years back from now I was losing man whatever I was doing I I was losing and if if you are new in the market if you are lacking knowledge if you are lacking experience you're going to lose all of your money and once you start losing money you will have that fear that you want to recover it man you will have that regret in your head you want to you want to get back your money and and you'll be losing more losing more consist L you'll be losing more so please my friend play professionally that's how you going to make money in the market but being professional at your work let's talk about few fundamental part about this token which really makes an impact in the market AC it's a big one man I read this token Man 2 hours approximately I spend on reading this project and I found it's a gem of a coin we have in our hands half a billion dollars of market cap 451 million half a billions okay uh 828 ain't much ain't volume ain't much less than a billion dollars of volume that ain't much we're going to find that it being trade at a different level $5 for $10 and volume would be near about5 to $10 billion of volume in in one day yeah a big move will come and that big move won't be like a small one like up to like maybe one because bro I have seen so so many so many bro so many coins and and they pumped a lot and then this coin got the potential it'll be pumping a lot man it's an opportunity yeah don't miss people who are watching Remember My Name crypto AR maybe after a week you're going to find this token at a $5 and you and you will remember me man this guy was bullish man yeah memes whole ecosystem AI memes bro it's an it's AI memes we cannot afford to miss at any cost this one exchange binance radium available radium man yeah available everywhere in the world and and we're going to find this to this will be available on coinbase as well on Kraken as well so more adoption we're going to see for this token it's a new token man launched 20 days back from now coinbase coinbase firstly like they they read the project for a couple of days like for a month and then they like kind of list a token man act maybe they have given the files of the project they have given the allocation to coinbase yeah like what do you think like if binance launch this token they have they have taken money bro they are here to make to to do business because back in 2016 I was with I was working with a founder and then what I found that uh like the founder with I was working with um he used to pay to ex exchanges man to like list a token man and then I was realized oh this is how things works but these things are under the table people don't talk about that very like private thing yeah but it's a fact yeah coin base will take some time but they they going to like launch this store on the platform and once we see it's on coinbase as well bro after bance coinbase is number second volume going to be like 10 times higher than binance because coinbase users I remember coin called bon launched in the market and then that token bro it pumped a lot and it got the accessibility bong okay this coin man bro it launched pumped oh my God 24 bro it pumped a shock the world we're going to see same sort of like pump Soul ecosystem Same Same Soul ecosystem so with bong as well we made money we are in a bull market man so it's an opportunity and you have to pick the right one Bon I was like very optimistic and that's how we that's how I have made my money even in Dodge man I was sure this going to this video going to be like big man I don't want that but yeah price prediction for ACT that's approximately $10 for shortterm for longterm $ $50 when to buy after breakout 0.54 stop loss 0.48 price prediction $10 I wish you all the best and if it don't break it'll be back I'll

approach man what going to happen now next everything in depth with simple words I'll not make it complicated okay before going in dep in deep and in depth of this token I have something for you guys all the information of coins which are going on stop you'll be finding in my private group I have a group which I have been running since 2019 for over 6 years or 5 years approximately 6 years I am running a group so I give a coin few days like rare pumped we bought near 1.9 was our buying price what happened since we bought it pumped 3x man your $10,000 you could have turned into $30,000 if you haven't joined the VIP this is small WhatsApp number DM me I am going to add you over two signals through which you can make daily profit like tlm man it's the most pump toen in the in the world at the moment we bought it in the morning man and since we bought we are sitting at 80% profit within 24 hours man within 6 hours by the way 18th of August in my VIP I not reveal my recent signals but this group is all you need to have my VIP when DM me let's come back to a topic man okay uh it found the bottom what happened in the past F let's talk for a minute man so it launched at $5 dropped badly I was waiting I was like eyeing this token every singly uh 5 days back from now I found I saw that it found the bottom Man 6 cents and we took a trade we took a trade in multiple buying level 6 Cent 7 cents under 10 cents we bought it at the highest level possible and then price pumped non stop from there is it worth buying or no of course not you have to understand it's a big project see from this level from 19 cents it dropped massively earlier from 203 cents it dropped massively and then again I saw back in the day as well it dropped from 20 cents and I was like okay these are the few levels we have for this token from 20 cents dropped massively twice Thrice and once it goes up from the price double from so as long as we are staying above 19 cents we are PO is it worth buying of course not we cannot afford to have this to in our portfolio reason being it already pumped now we have to wait once price will be back to 10 cents when to buy if it drops up to 10 cents we're going to buy if you are buying above 10 cents you're going to lose everything in the market how we have made money in the market by buying this token when it was at the bottom we took a trade less than 10 cents that's how we have made money in the market now rare is trending everywhere in the world people who are buying now they will become exit liquidity what does that means somebody has to lose money somebody has to lose money to make money in the market as simple as that so people who are buying we bought at 6 cents we want to sell somebody has to buy we'll make money and somebody will buy the top and holding the bag so I don't want you guys to be doing that some people are asking me oh when to buy should I buy right now uh uh I'll be buying now at 27 no of course not don't have this like why you are even asking this question don't have this mindset I'll be buying the top no if you are buying you should know how many ways do we have in the market to make money we have two ways to make money in the market once price will be back to 10 cents that's the one way of taking trade in the market and making money that's the first way the other way if you see if I remove everything completely man and if I draw one more horizontal line this was the top 34 cents we're going to buy I'll be buying this token once I see price breaks 35 cents if it breaks 35 cents take a trade play profit I want you guys to make money if you are following my content I have taken 10,000 trades being in the game for over a decade man so if I'm saying something I totally mean it man okay if it drops we're going to buy 10 cents 9 cents 10 cents if it drops buy over over here at 10 cents good to go if it drops 10 cents good to go buy and make the most money if you want to make money if you want to lose money buy now yeah the other way we have buying right after the breakout 36 Cents people who want to take a trade in rare just have some patience price prediction for rare is a dollar it going to fly like this a dollar we can double our money we can triple our money from rare I want to address see buying price 36 let me like finish this buying price 36 Cents put a stop loss 33 33 cents price prediction a dollar fine we have got the setup if it goes upside we're going to buy if it drops we'll be buying this part buying price fine let's like keep this part aside I have made lot of videos and I want to address people who have been holding this token who took a trade by joining the VIP by following any of my content for them I want to address that take out 70 80% because it pump 5x your $110,000 you could have turned into or you have turned into $50,000 in profit so at least book $40,000 at least book 80% of your money whatever money you have made rest 20% keep in hold and put a stop loss 19 cents as long as we are above this level 20 cents we are bullish and if it drops less than 20 it won't take much time to be be back it won't take much time to be back to 9 cents 10 cents I hope hope you guys got my point and I have made thousands of videos man as of now collectively I have different channels man Ive made over thou 6,000 videos as of now on the internet and if I'm saying something bro like if you not follow you will realize later on you'll lose everything Man mark my words man yeah so play Prof if it goes upside 36 Cents good to go 33 cents stop loss price prediction a dollar for long term it going to pump over $10 man yeah bare minimum $10 it going to pump nonstop and if price will be back to 10 cents we're going to buy and make the most money out of it okay uh before going in depth of the fundamentals from where we can buy we can buy from binance coinbase available everywhere in the world yeah buy and make the most money market cap in much 180th most valuable crypto $240 million of Market Cap supplies less than a billion coins we have in the market everything is on point about this man Collective nft Marketplace th platform it to provide the UPN price prediction I have is approximately $10 man I want to know what you guys think about this toen leave your thoughts in the comments regarding super and if you want to know like what to do and if you're having confusion if you want someone to talk about like coins at early stage only place we have in the world that's my VIP you name a coin you will say Bitcoin Bitcoin we bought when nobody was buying Bitcoin when I was the only guy who talked about Bitcoin we B we bought it like $119,000 when it was dropping badly we we took a trade 3 years back from now and we are sitting at 3x profit in Bitcoin as well this group I have been running for approximately 6 years man haven't join DM me this is my WhatsApp number I wish you all the best have a nice

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.  #arkham #arkm #crypto","guys I am embarrassed I'm embarrassed that I haven't talked about Arham before even though I use Arham pretty much every day let's have a look at the arkm token let's have a look at the tokenomics let's have a look at the data that most people are not looking at because the price is going absolutely ballistic it almost went up 170% in the last month alone we're now at $138 and I believe this is entirely Justified Arkham is not just a theoretical platform that might get some ad at some point that might get useful at some point no the Arham platform is incredibly useful even today and of course it does get improvements all the time now what is Aram about actually Aram is a research tool for the blockchain so you can find out who owns what kind of wallet what other wallets has that wallet interacted with and what are the potential intentions behind the transaction and so for this project we don't have to theorize about the utility and go through the white paper Etc we can actually look at the platform in action life have a look at this this is platform. Aram intelligence.com and here we can search for people funds exchanges let's search for our favorite influencer Alex Becka we do get a balance history of this wallet we also get a transfer history and have a look at this we can plug the wallet address into the visualizer and then see who Alex Becker interacted with who did he get money from who did he send money to there are also alerts so again you can plug in any wallet address and you can get alerts maybe on your telegram maybe on your Discord maybe via email to see when those wallets are buying and selling Aram allows for all of this and so it's really no big surprise that the price is finally catching up that finally people are buying the token as well the big question though is what's the token nomics what's the supply because in the end it's not just demand that's driving the price it's also the supply how much does the supply increase what are the early investors getting what is the team getting how much tokens are being sold for marketing for example now here is Cryptor rank. and we can see that a lot of the tokens have not yet been unlocked there are still locked tokens by the investors still locked tokens by the core contributors advisers also haven't yet been paid and so we can see an unlock schedule over here only 15% of all of RM tokens are circulating so the demand of the token has to grow by roughly 7x a bit less than that of over the span of those unlocks for the price to stay stable if demand doesn't grow as quickly then the price of course will go down but here's the question how quickly do those tokens actually unlock is this a danger in this current bull market is the token dilution too fast to answer that question we've got another website called token. unlocks.com tokens 1 year from now this will be 317 million so the supply will grow by roughly 68 69% that's unfortunately not too pretty but it can be outgrown if we continue to be in a bull market if Arham gets continued adoption but what is the Smart money saying here what are the whales actually doing let's look at who's buying here is this retail is this the Wales why is the price going up that much specifically why did the price go up by 16319 in a single month let's have a look at the numbers on the left side we've got retail on the right side we've got the Wales so on the left side we see the number of wallets that hold at least 1,000 Arham tokens so at the current price that's roughly $1,400 this is what I'd consider retail in the middle we've got mediumsized retail that's now $14,000 on the right side we've got the Wales that's $140,000 those are all long-term charts starting in July of last year here are the same charts just for the last month in the last month the number of heavy weights have increased by roughly 10% medium-sized retail stayed flat and small retail increased by a bit less than 10% so clearly the whales are buying despite the potentially problematic toomics and I believe that's the main reason why the price is going up because just an increase of less than 10% by retail can't drive the price by that much it's the heavy weights that accumulate here here's the thing I believe that when the heavy weights are accumulating this is actually good because they tend to do the better calls over the long term I believe that trading crypto is a game of both luck but but also skill and the more you play the game the less the luck component becomes important and the more the skill shines through so the people that are the whales they tend to make the better calls on average so when I see them buying that's good I very much like the product of Arkham and I do believe that the supply expansion can be outgrown in a bull market in a bare Market the to economics are dangerous but right now in a bull market I think things seem to be fine to ride this wave if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish you this regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram feel free to join us the link is down below",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlfV-U5RDRs,"['Core', 'Arkham', 'JUST', 'WHY', 'PAID']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlfV-U5RDRs/hqdefault.jpg,2024-02-22T10:30:10Z

#cryptocurrency #crypto","the i.net token on Solana just launched and today it's up more than 50% let's have a look at some fundamentals let's have a look at onchain analytics to find out how much longer this really could potentially last because this is I believe the best approach to crypto investing in general we want to look at data most people are not considering to get a market Edge right if we want to pick the bottoms and the tops better than others we need to have information most people aren't considering so here's the chart today we are currently at $5.95 we are up 46% today initially the price dumped now it's recovering let's have a look at some data there's a ton of trading volume on chain for the io token in the last 24 hours we saw the leading liquidity pool exchanging 9.4 Million worth of IO we have another liquidity pool with 3.7 million another one with 3 million there is activity here in terms of trading volume it's at place number 51 in the last 24 hours and that's on the salana Chain which is mainly dominated by memec coin trading recently i.net is a breath of fresh air it's not a mem coin it's the exact opposite it's decentralized GPU Computing thus it can be seen as a competitor to render or to aash or maybe to the recently launched eia I made a video specifically on AIA as well on this channel just published recently feel free to check it out it has quite a bit of momentum today as well so let's have a look at the numbers let's find out whether or not IO Net's numbers are real or if there's manipulation let's compare the different social metrics first so we've got the landing page and on that landing page there is a video link to a YouTube video and YouTube of course publishes the number of views we've got 33,000 views in the last 9 days that can be compared to the number of followers on Twitter which is more than half a million not sure if that's 100% legitimate right maybe those Twitter followers are at least partially inflated let's have a look at the number of telegram members that's 113,000 roughly on chain we've got 85,000 holders now let's have a look at the largest liquidity pool on Jupiter in the last 24 hours we have seen roughly 1,000 wallets 400 bought 500 sold with 85,000 holders so it looks like not all of those holders bought the token probably in allocation probably an airdrop a pre-sale Etc the main problem with crypto YouTube is conflict of interest too many YouTubers shill garbage promote garbage and fill up their pockets in the background not this channel instead they're simply the offer where I share my skills my perspectives to you and where I also share direct access to me where you can ask me any questions feel free to check it out the premium membership link is down below now the most important thing to figure out where the price might go is to find out the supply versus demand Dynamics let's have a look at the supply Dynamics what kind of token issuance is there over time for the io token have a look at the documentation we're starting out with 200 million tokens this goes all the way up to a bit over 700 million tokens the documentation text is a bit conflicting because here we apparently starting with half a billion tokens and then increase to 800 million tokens over 20 years half of the tokens go to the community 12.5 to early Beckers that's during the seed round another 10.2 during series a another 11.3 to core contributors and 16 to the ecosystem looks like a dilution of one to2 roughly here are those early backers we've got quite a few investors also yat over here from Hong Kong the race was in March of this year 300 million in total VC money in a token is always a double-edged sord on the one hand we've got some kind of professionalism behind this right there's not going to be just a pump and dump but on the other hand we also have token dilution and at some point those early backers want to have their money back plus some and that of course is bad for the people buying into the token so the vest thingss are super super important demand has to grow faster than the token unlocks and it appears that those unlocks might be happening here at the 12 Mark which probably means 12 months this access isn't labeled so yeah the price is doing quite well here's the price chart but we're not just keeping it with that I like to look at the onchain metrics and the data over here behind me that comes from a tour that I've developed myself you can plug in any Solana token into this tool the tools available to the premium members down below the Bitcoin strategy.com and we see that so far every day the number of first-time Traders is exceeding the number of recurring Traders so the investor base is growing and a growing investor base of course means potentially a growing price if there's nobody dumping right as long as there's more and more people jumping onto a project the price should be rising so this all looks Healy this implies that the price can go beyond the $6 and we can also see that over time the number of retail investors is growing right so this is not just Wales jumping in the share of trading volume generated by small retail is growing it's currently at 45.7% of all of trading volume now here's the thing the price the inherent price of I o.net is already pretty large because have a look at this this is render this is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the GPU space this has a fully diluted market cap of 4.7 million the fully diluted market cap of IO net is already larger than that and I'm not sure fundamentally this is Justified I believe that currently with the launch with all of that excitement the centralized exchanges are supporting the rally because check this out trading doesn't just happen on radium and on Jupiter in a decentralized manner most of trading happens on binance and on buybit and on gate.io there's even leverage in this game via Perpetual Futures so derivative contracts bets on the price so yes people are jumping on this yes the price development looks healthy but there is some real risk with those prices right should IET really be larger than render I'm not so sure I will keep a very close eye on the onchain metrics and I will continue to make updates on i.net if you want to see those updates feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you've got telegram then feel free to join us the link is down below looking very much forward to chatting

vesting has happened mainly already let's have a look at some of the data that most people aren't looking at let's look at the pros but also at the cons the pile token went up by more than 2,000% since launch of June in last year and the current momentum is still nice we are now up 76% in this month alone and what I very much like about this token is that it's still mainly traded decentralized this is not manipulation by the centralized exchanges more than half of trading volume was directly on the ethereum chain on Unis swap the minority of trading volume is on htx and on gate.io this is nice because this way we can look at the blockchain and we can actually look at the holder distribution we can actually look at who's buying and who's selling here who's driving those price Dynamics I will not bore you with the marketing Jaz on the website tldr is you can create your own spots that can be deployed anywhere on Discord on telegram on a website and I've tried it out and it worked the answer wasn't that impressive but at least you've got a working product this cannot be set for every crypto AI project now let's talk toomics there's a maximum supply of 1 billion and 80% of that is already circulating this is very positive for cryptocurrency of that age 80% circulating Supply means that there won't be too many new tokens hitting the Market meaning we won't see a lot of expanding Supply potentially depressing the price if demand can't keep up an altcoin that's less than a year old that has 80% already circulating is very very nice now here's another interesting point I actually don't know how this is paid you can stake your P AI tokens and depending on the duration of your lockup you get different API up to 60% annualized if you're locking this up for 56 days now this says 90% Eve reward reward share I believe part of this might be paid through the taxes which is the next big point when you're buying and selling the pel AI token on the ethereum Chain you don't just pay the ethereum gas fees you also pay 4% whenever you buy and an additional 4% whenever you sell in other words this is not a token where you can actively trade in and out of this is a token you have to hold for a while so I might as well lock it up for 56 days and get at least parts of those costs back now I'm looking at the positives and negatives on this channel and I look at data most people aren't looking at and so we are going to look at who is buying here who's selling here is this small retail or is this the large Wales who's driving all of this and as usual let's look at the tool that I've developed myself that I make available to the premium members you can pluck in any ethereum token in this tool and get real-time data so I plugged in the P AI token on the left side we've got the number of wallets that hold at least a ,000 tokens so at the current price that's $244 I consider this small retail in the middle we've got medium-sized retail it's a 10x from the left chart so this is now $2,400 worth of the token on the right side we've got the Wales this is now $24,000 worth of the token small retail is buying and buying mediumsized retail is buying a bit slower and the Wales are selling off those are long-term charts starting in July of 2023 here is the same just for the last 30 days pretty much the same picture so who's driving the rally it's 100% retail but there's more to it over here we've got the token distribution who owns the token and look at this 41% is held by a smart contract another 18% is held in investing contract then two more smart contracts then already gate.io and everything that goes below this is relatively small relatively speaking let's have a look how the token balance in those smart contracts developed this is the largest holder currently it's a accumulating and accumulating and this is very very positive 415 million currently in this contract alone and note there's only 1 billion tokens second we've got the vesting contract and of course here the balance is going down 18% of the entire Supply is in this contract unfortunately I couldn't find the future unlocks here this would be very interesting to see how much this effect could in the end overlay this effect this is 400 million here we've got 1880 million left if this continues to crash very quickly this could be a danger so if you find the vesting schedule of pel AI somewhere in any documentation or any website please comment the link down below and I will pin that link this is the fifth largest holder also rather going down also not a huge balance 24 million and this is also slowing down so not really that much reason for concern I believe so fundamentally the token looks interesting a lot of the vesting has already happened the market cap isn't huge the product seems to work and if the hype around AI tokens reignites again then I think pel AI can do easily a multiple X from here I mean right now we are only at 194 million market cap fully diluted a bit more 244 still this is not large whatsoever I am considering to buy a few pel AI tokens as well I say I will not I have I never front run you guys so if I buy then I always do this several hours after after publishing a video so you can front run me I will never front run you if it's your first time here feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly like would be very

is a very complex ecosystem and in order to add more confusion to all of this this video has a lot of different charts with data we're trying to find out where is currently Capital flowing we're trying to find out where is adoption happening does it makes sense overall to still butic or how it's now called P let's have a look at all those different charts now in the last month the momentum around polygon metic wasn't too bad have a look at the total value locked change polygon let all the other chains an increase of 12.6% while ethereum lost 7% and parts of this might be attributed to the adoption of the new POS token but let's zoom out a little bit this is the total value locked of all of defi across all chains over the years and we had our nice defi summer in 2022 where we picked out at 180 billion now we are a bit above 80 billion but again that's all of defi here we've got the same chart but for polygon Matic that pecked out at 10 billion and since then went down by 90% we don't see a recovery similar to the rest of Defi and the reason why we're still relatively low in the total value locked is because the meic token itself didn't do too well here is the total value locked measured in meic tokens and yes we do see a bit of increase over here so in US Dollars we are flat in meic tokens we do adoption in other words the majority of those depressing numbers in terms of total value lock come simply from the price reduction of the medic token now why did the price go down let's have a look at a few onchain metrics so over here we've got the number of unique depositors on the polygon ZK evm chain so there are several different chains right and this is one of the subchains we see a lot of activity around May and August of 2023 a little bit of a Revival in April of this year but since then it's rather quiet that low activity in terms of depositors is not reflected in the total value lock though again this is the ZK evm this is not all of polygon so the ZK evm looks fine momentum isn't great for the last year but at least we are somewhat flat it's currently at around 100 million but again when we look at all of polygon there's very little growth for the last 2 years roughly now here's a nice comparison of different layer twos so layer one is ethereum and then there are different SC aing Solutions on top of ethereum so polygon was the very first one we've also got the base we've got optimism we've got arbitrum let's compare how many funds get transferred or get bridged from ethereum to those layer tws so again we see here polygon ZK evm first which peaked out in q1 of 2024 since then Capital tends to rather flow out or at least decrease in value but now let's add all of those other options right we are now at 100 million at current value this is how it looks with all those other chains the total here is at 180 billion so the polygon that K evm is only 0.5% of all of that and it can be barely seen in this chart it's like this purple sliver those purple pixels that we see every now and then but it's really dominating the layer twos is optimism and arbitrum arbitrum in Orange optimism in red and so here's the market share of those different layer twos so if you simply normalize this chart to 100% the chain for Perpetual futures D ydx is losing ground arbitrum is gaining ground so is optimism and what we see here at the bottom in purple that's the base chain the layer two that's supported by coinbase and so again polygon ZK evm is a small sliver of the bridged value here's the problem with crypto YouTube people promoting becoming dgen or buying 100 x coins that's what gives clicks but that's not what's going to bring you forward I refuse to take money from centralized exchanges I refuse to take money from crypto projects I refuse to pump and dump a coin and filling up my pockets in the background I don't do any of this instead I share my knowledge in the form of tutorials in the premium membership so that's content that won't do well on YouTube but that builds up skill over time you can also directly contact me over there you can directly pick my brain feel free to check it out the bitcoin.com is the link now we have seen how the number of depositors for polygon tended to be very small recently right we had our Peak roughly 1 and a half years ago now that's very small is this polygon specific or is this overall for defi that people don't use the layer twos that much anymore the answer is in the following chart have a look at this this is the number of users that bridge over to those various chains and again in July of 2023 we've seen quite a lot of activity but this did slow down significantly so it's not just polygon specific all of those layer tws get less and less bridging activity that doesn't mean though that the layer twos aren't used right this is the number of active addresses so the layer tws are fulfilling their promise they are getting used there are more and more active addresses however just because the share of active addresses is rising does not mean that more money is getting bridged over so it's simply just the existing players with their funds that are battling against one another let's go back to polygon again let's have a look at the Smart contracts that get created so that's how adoption happens right developers deploy smart contracts and then users use those smart contracts so a leading indicator could simply be a lot of creation of those contracts now again April and May of 2023 saw a lot of smart contract creation activity now we are rather low you might notice I'm simply just presenting the data right I'm not judging anything here have a look at this this is the decentralized exchange volume so how many dollars get traded every day on polygon dexas and that's interesting right because there's no new funds getting bridged over but the funds that are there they get continued swapping activity and those swaps tend to have lower of a US dollar amount because have a look at this this is the number of Trades and this is the number of Traders so just compare this the number of Traders is rather low the number of Traders is rather high so the trades per Trader are going up how much of this is organic how much of this is automatic trading via Arbitrage Bots and by front run Bots I don't know it's simply just the raw data here and so the layer TOS got way more efficient right there had been several updates reducing the gas fees ethereum still has very expensive gas fees but the layer tws don't and so we see a crash in those data fees which is good especially since the number of Trades is pretty constant but that also means that the revenue for those layer twos tends to decline back to polygon the market share of polygon unfortunately is decreasing when we just look at the number of transactions the chain that's really gain is BAS base continues to gain more and more of the layer 2 pi the issue with Bas though is that we don't have a base token that we can bet on some people bet on the aerod Drome token so on the largest decentralized exchange on base the problem with arrow is the tokenomics we don't really know how many new tokens will hit the market so even though base is pretty reliably growing we can't really bet on this for polygon unfortunately we don't see the share growing we can also look at this individually in December of 2022 there was an 80% market share right polygon was one of the first layer tools now it's only at around 30% and so the way I interpret all of this data is that it seems like the market is somewhat maturing right there are people that have already bridged over their funds they continue trading and when we look at the number of new users versus recurring users we are seeing the exact same Trend so there's less and less new users compared to recurring users it's existing players that take over now the big question with all of this is of course where might the price go and what I find most interesting is of course where might P or metic go relative to ethereum because the overall crypto Market is a completely different story right we have to look at stable coin Market flows Etc if you just look at outperformance because we want to outperform bitcoin and ethereum and we look at that so for example meic divided by ethereum or meic divided by Bitcoin we get the following chart so this is meic relative to Eve and the volatility here is very large meic peaked versus ethereum in February of last year and since then underperformed by more than 80% so the conversion to the P token definitely did not support the price and we did have several technical supports right where we bounced off several times but unfortunately we did not hold that support in February we also did not hold the secondary support in May and now we've got one more support let's see whether or not this can hold crypto sometimes is a about buying low and selling high and obviously now the meic price is comparatively low the only problem that I have is I'm somewhat unclear about the tokenomics as in the supply side isn't that clear to me have a look at this this is the number of circulating meic tokens over time so we did get our regular unlocks and it seems like this peaked out at 10 billion but when we now go to the same page right token. unlocks do app and we look at the P page we see that there's another build ion tokens more than 1 billion that could unlock at any point in time and on coin market cap we see that the current market cap is at 2 billion but the fully diluted market cap at 3.8 billion so there's room for the metic supply to almost double and that of course isn't that great for the relative valuation to ethereum either anyhow we are now very close to a decision will we hold that final support or is Matic going to crash down and see those lows of 2021 it appears yes people are using metic but it's simply just at the current level and there is not a lot of inflows right now the base chain seems to be stealing the show I myself was invested in metic and I was speculating on this support to hold once it didn't I exited right now I'm just on the sidelines and observe what's happening if we are going down further then I might consider to even short meic again relative to ethereum not necessarily relative to the US dollar I'm

üü¢Buy Goatseus Maximus Now? üöÄ Goat Crypto Token Analysisüíµ,"Goatseus Maximus is a newly emerging meme cryptocurrency that seeks to capitalize on the humor, virality, and cult-like community-building that often drives the success of meme coins. Like many meme coins, Goatseus Maximus blends internet meme culture with speculative crypto trading, offering a mix of fun and potential profit to early adopters.  üöÄ Key Features of Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) Coin: 1. Meme-Based Branding üêê The name ""Goatseus Maximus"" is a play on ""Goat,"" often used in modern slang as an acronym for ""Greatest Of All Time,"" and ""Maximus"" adds a humorous, grandiose twist to the meme. The token likely taps into this meme-driven market, making it more about community engagement and viral marketing rather than intrinsic utility or technology.  Meme Power: Its success, like other meme coins, relies heavily on internet culture and the ability to go viral on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok. 2. Community-Driven Growth üåç Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is designed to thrive based on its community. Meme coins are often propelled by an enthusiastic base of users who are involved in promoting the coin through memes, social media posts, and viral campaigns. This creates momentum as more people hear about and buy into the coin.  Community Involvement: The more active and passionate the Goatseus Maximus community is, the better the chances for the token to experience short-term spikes in price. In many cases, meme coins thrive solely on hype. 3. Low-Cost Entry for Retail Investors üíµ Like most meme coins, Goatseus Maximus is likely priced very low initially, making it easy for small retail investors to purchase large quantities of the token without significant financial commitment. This low barrier to entry encourages speculative buying, especially among those looking to get in early and hope for viral price jumps.  Investment Insight: Early adopters of Goatseus Maximus could see substantial gains if the token catches on, but meme coins are notoriously volatile, so only invest what you can afford to lose. 4. Viral Marketing Potential üî• Meme coins like Goatseus Maximus depend on their ability to generate viral social media campaigns. If GOAT Coin can garner attention through meme creators, influencers, or crypto enthusiasts, it could gain enough traction to experience rapid growth.  Key Insight: Meme coins often explode in value when they go viral. Social media trends and influencer endorsements are key to pushing the price higher. 5. Speculative Trading üìà While some cryptocurrencies aim for long-term use cases (e.g., smart contracts, DeFi), Goatseus Maximus likely falls into the category of a speculative asset. Its value is driven primarily by hype and demand rather than any inherent utility. These coins tend to have short-term pumps in value, often followed by steep declines if the community loses interest.  Investment Tip: Timing is crucial with meme coins. Early entry and exits during price surges may lead to profits, but holding too long in the hopes of sustained growth can be risky. üöÄ Should You Buy Goatseus Maximus Now? Pros of Buying Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): Potential for High Returns: If Goatseus Maximus goes viral or gets significant attention from influencers, early buyers could see significant returns. Low-Cost Entry: As with many meme coins, it's possible to buy a large number of tokens at a low price, making it accessible to small retail investors. Community Support: Meme coins with active, passionate communities can sometimes sustain momentum, leading to short-term price pumps. Cons of Buying Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): Extreme Volatility: Meme coins are known for their price volatility, meaning you could lose a significant portion of your investment if the hype dies down. Lack of Utility: Unlike established coins with real-world use cases (e.g., Ethereum, Solana), Goatseus Maximus likely lacks intrinsic utility, making it heavily dependent on speculation and marketing. Short-Term Focus: Meme coins are often pump-and-dump assets, with price spikes driven by viral trends followed by rapid declines once the hype fades. üöÄ Goatseus Maximus Price Prediction for 2024 Given that Goatseus Maximus is a meme coin with no established utility, its price prediction is highly speculative and dependent on factors like community growth, viral trends, and exchange listings.  Bullish Scenario: If Goatseus Maximus can tap into internet culture and go viral, it may experience explosive price growth, similar to coins like Dogecoin or PepeCoin. Strong community engagement and social media promotion are key to driving this.  #GoatseusMaximus #GoatToken #Crypto2024 #CryptoReview #GoatCrypto #Investing #CryptoAnalysis #PricePrediction","hello all crypt lovers with you cryptomax and today review crypt coins go hell there such interesting coins created by artificial intelligence it was launched on pamphan and quite successfully how do you see the coin start was on October 11th and currently On the 20th, this coin takes 29 cents. c its cost and she started as you can see 5 zeros 5 zeros she already did at least right now I'll tell you how much 170% 170% made given ma'am horse on a salad with created artificial intelligence called go hell goat sensam maximus pretty interesting coin let's take her apart in more detail yeah price of this coin 29 cents aa Market cap capitalization 290,000,000 as you like this is literally just for some umm 20 in 9 days for 9 days the capitalization of this coin was 290,000,000 pretty good and holders 27,000 that's crazy growth just crazy height as you see at this stage correction of this coin is underway but as you can see there was a bounce and I now think she will come back and quite calmly wrap its cost at least straight 0 5 cents let's look in more detail on this coin aa let's switch to koin on Coin Market sneakers let's see what's here well a little bit less capitalization estimate of 270 yes 1 000 000 yes that is, it is a capitalization of 291 and here it turns out 290 well 2 well somewhere like that aa see where you can buy this ma'am coin this ma'am coin can be bought mainly on raylimi but there are also exchanges es tae x and game Theo Max as if well she is supported by orca bitgate Bean X this is where you can buy a chart on cohen Market cap only from 15th October well, not bad as if for this coin this coin on salania on the salanya contract can be viewed and also on holders of this coin keep the coin data somewhere like I said pretty still not bad 27,000 aa on the contract right now we will see what is here well right now he is loading for now and also this is such information what the this contract this coin was launched on paufan on pamphania and launched I'm pretty still interesting creator of Egyx 7 Ts 1 here he launched coins like here is god a a e some gosproin some and here is such a coin at all even without a name he was creating here's 5 5 memcoins and this coin right now is quite successful by price started it by price 0 4 and 3 0 4 and now she is in the house ok started as you see on pamslan given memcoin so this one loads aa let's see umm holders like I said earlier here is 27 1,000 out of 27,000 as you can see uh obvious obvious monopolists I don't see 1 and 3% 1 0 1% 1% 1% so everything is fine here aa let's go to bulyx you can also look at the bulyx holder here at all holders estimate at almost 30,000 30,000 holders so what for how much is the 11th today 20th in 9 days such a growth of 30,000 is just awesome success just a colossal success there are people who hold the floor 4,000,000 by 2 3 by 2 000 000 coin data there is such a huge amount of money held by these people aa let's go to Telegram look at the community in telegram here 2 and 8 but what do you think on Twitter or in x this is pretty taki huge The huge community that exists in on x post constantly somehow they spell artificial intelligence 2 hours 02: 02 every 2 hours here are new posts out there so substantially they They post their new articles here.

üü¢ What is GRUMPY Cat Coin üöÄ GRUMPY Crypto Token Analysis üíµ,"GRUMPY Cat Coin is a meme-based cryptocurrency that draws its inspiration from the internet's beloved Grumpy Cat meme. This coin stands out in the vast sea of meme tokens by leveraging nostalgia and humor, combined with the viral appeal of one of the most iconic internet personalities. Grumpy Cat Coin emphasizes community-driven growth and charitable initiatives, making it more than just another meme coin in the market.    ### Key Features of GRUMPY Cat Coin üöÄ    #### 1. **Meme Power**      - **Cultural Icon**: Grumpy Cat's legacy as one of the internet's most recognizable memes gives this coin instant recognition and credibility in meme culture.      - **Fun and Relatable**: The coin embodies the ""grumpy yet lovable"" attitude, creating a fun and engaging community vibe.    #### 2. **Community-Focused Growth**      - **Decentralized Ownership**: GRUMPY Cat Coin is fully community-driven, with no centralized control. Holders contribute to the project's direction through active participation.      - **Viral Marketing**: Fueled by memes, social media campaigns, and community engagement, the coin thrives on organic growth and widespread online appeal.    #### 3. **Charitable Initiatives**      - A portion of the project's funds or transaction fees is often dedicated to **animal welfare charities**, reflecting the legacy of the real-life Grumpy Cat. This unique feature sets it apart from other meme tokens by adding a philanthropic angle.    #### 4. **Blockchain Integration**      - Built on a scalable and efficient blockchain such as **Ethereum (ERC-20)** or **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, GRUMPY Cat Coin ensures:         - **Low transaction fees**         - **Fast transfers**         - **Widespread compatibility**    #### 5. **Tokenomics**      - **Large Supply**: GRUMPY Cat Coin likely has a high token supply, which keeps the per-token price low and encourages widespread adoption.      - **Deflationary Mechanisms**: The project may include token burns to reduce supply over time, potentially increasing value.      - **Holder Rewards**: Redistribution mechanics could reward long-term holders with passive income directly to their wallets.    ---  ### Why Invest in GRUMPY Cat Coin?    #### 1. **Nostalgia-Driven Popularity**      Grumpy Cat's enduring appeal ensures a solid foundation of interest among meme enthusiasts and casual crypto investors.    #### 2. **Charity with a Purpose**      Supporting animal welfare through donations aligns the project with a meaningful cause, giving investors a sense of purpose alongside potential profit.    #### 3. **Community Engagement**      A strong, passionate community backing the token makes it more likely to gain traction in the competitive meme coin space.    #### 4. **Potential for Viral Growth**      With its humorous branding and meme-based marketing, GRUMPY Cat Coin is well-positioned to go viral, driving up demand and visibility.    ### Risks and Challenges    1. **Volatility**      Meme coins are notoriously volatile, with prices often driven by hype rather than intrinsic value.    2. **Speculative Nature**      Without strong utilities or innovative features, GRUMPY Cat Coin relies heavily on its community and marketing efforts to maintain momentum.    3. **Market Saturation**      The meme token space is crowded, and standing out requires continuous creativity and effort.    4. **Rug Pull Risk**      Always verify the legitimacy of the project, its team, and its smart contract to ensure the coin is not a scam.    ### GRUMPY Cat Coin Price Prediction    The price of GRUMPY Cat Coin depends on several factors:   - **Community Support**: A large and active community can drive demand and sustain interest in the token.   - **Charity Initiatives**: Continued donations to animal welfare charities can help maintain a positive reputation and attract socially conscious investors.   - **Viral Campaigns**: Partnerships with influencers or successful social media trends can cause rapid price spikes.    In the short term, the token may experience sharp fluctuations due to speculative trading. Long-term growth will hinge on consistent community engagement and the development of unique use cases.    ### How to Buy GRUMPY Cat Coin    1. **Set Up a Wallet**      - Use a crypto wallet compatible with the blockchain, such as **MetaMask** for Ethereum or **Trust Wallet** for Binance Smart Chain.    2. **Access a DEX**      - GRUMPY Cat Coin is likely listed on decentralized exchanges like **Uniswap** (ERC-20) or **PancakeSwap** (BSC).      - Swap a base cryptocurrency like **ETH** or **BNB** for GRUMPY Cat Coin.    3. **Join the Community**      - Follow official GRUMPY Cat Coin social channels, such as Telegram, Twitter, or Discord, for updates, announcements, and memes.     #GrumpyCatCoin #Crypto #MemeToken #Blockchain #CryptoCommunity #AnimalCharity #ERC20 #BNB #Tokenomics #CryptoAnalysis",hello all crypt lovers with you cryptomax and today another review ma'am coin gramby here is such a gramby kitty already gave fifty percent for the current day that's the kind of rocket that flew to two cents but the candle fell and right now this Œºn is traded at a price of two zeros seven like subscribe to my channel and I continue will be very interesting aa this mmcoin has one hundred thirty seven thousand users very large holder base of this m mconone sooner or later this m mcond will fly up let's understand in more detail this emcoin The capitalization of this project is seventy million molding one and two million dollars go on go to the site deco terminal what will we see here uh this schedule is very busy the price is the same as me and said two zeros seven what's interesting here It is clear that this project is only six days and in such a short period they have collected such a huge community let's see further look at aa security and audit uh hecatelmental he says next overall score analysis by forty five percent very little information all twenty is estimated aa the creator is also zero incomprehensible and pool thirty one yes this is the assessment of the audio gekaterminal go further go to click check click check rates this memcon at ninety two percent out of a hundred very good performance lets see next total check uhh nine out of eleven is also good check uh code analysis is hundred percent very good by the number of users three holders have three percent and a top ten holders have a seven s half percent is also pretty taki good kick check rates this momcoine very positively go further uh move on to another analysis and hecateip and oh what is he saying that this mmcoin from the start has already given forty-eight thousand one of the pros this is of course a huge growth of this bomcoin this is just the beginning uh let's go further look at the holders holder is one hundred thirty seven thousand and there are people who have almost one million k from bucks six hundred fifty six hundred five hundred thirty nine thousand bucks so a lot of money invested in this mamham covid go on go to loot max loot loos tells us the following staff mmc one see there are no obvious movements of others at all everything here only one person has one and three percent and then by zero eight zero seven zero seven zero six zero six and so on pretty much everything is fine let's go on the wallet at the moment on the wallet yes what do we see here one dollar sixty seven cents more and more in one wallet of others coins I don't see them no and social networks let's go on social media and see what's on social media telegram rate its at ninety aa followers are pretty small for such a kitty site at this memcoin yet tells us about her dexcreen but this account of mine is all ahead and of course twitter or x twitter either x says the following in the twenty-first year created this page and no longer has two thousand eight hundred and forty-three user pretty taki good indication where I believe that this ma'am coin is only six days old e post the first one was posted twenty hours ago such here ma'am ma'am cat but they say that even on the mexi they are wooded or soon to be listing for the grammys on the max exchange pretty good go on here is such a cat very similar to grampy here so pretty good twitter as for me even thats grandpa frost santa claus starred here is promising them coin so grampy cat is koin you see basically the same ones could place more bright interesting meme pictures so that's the kind of meme conor promising and as you can see from the chart it grew by this evaluation by evaluation site gatkept and he already gave forty eight thousand percent this is just the beginning as for me this mmcoon only only developing and it has a huge prospect for growth especially the community he has one hundred and thirty-seven thousand so here is such a review of memmonenki grempy kitty if you liked this video put like subscribe to my channel go to my playlists I have a lot of interesting meme reviews so everyone thank you for your attention everyone bye,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fic7tNiBeQA,"['JUST', 'SIX']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fic7tNiBeQA/hqdefault.jpg,2024-11-22T08:15:00Z

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.,"hi everyone is it worth buying dock let's figure it out what's in the chart in the last 24 hours it pumped over 15% but there's this bad news we have it's going to the list from binus let me check once yeah yeah yeah like it'll be the listing from binance of 22nd of this month man so stay away if you are wondering about this to is it worth buying I would say no don't buy yeah big no man big no in a small time frame one hour time frame yeah uh it's bullish man the way graph has formed as of now it's bullish but we have to check from where we can buy if it got delisted from binance and why it's being delisted from binance we'll go in deep deep dive into the project in and out we'll go in the project man doc okay do check over ranking man oh my but it's in the game I remember it's in the game for almost 7 years if I'm not wrong for long time and anyone who have been doing crypto for 5 years they have an idea about this token it used to being trade at a dollar I don't know like long back long back for how long uh 6 years man so it's in the game for long time it's a AI token what was the alltime high alltime high was near about 25 cents that was 2018 man after 28 march to May was the alltime high like the bull market of cryptocurrency man it dropped badly man it dropped badly it has been be man ever since it made the top it has been bearish if I open over here in one week time frame it has been be man from 18 cents to this level oh my God less than less than one cent this is a real this is a real man is it worth buying this Tok no stay away man reason being it's going to theist why it's going up because of exit liquidated because uh somebody has to lose money to make money in the market if you are buying something somebody is selling trading means what buy and sell so think from that perspective this token is going to the list from bance apart from binance where it's available oh this tire three exchanges Man coin ex coin dcx Co coin is a good one get iio Ain like reliable yeah of course not people are saving their like people are saving their tax and um doing different things which I'll not talk about but yeah apart from this biners man it's not available many like many weere like yeah so it's like not that kind of project which is alive that's why not bringing volume in the market man so stay away stay away that's all I can say $10 million of market cap ranking is th000 if you are putting into a project man make sure that rankings top 200 Top 300 Max Man play safe think about your money man if you are putting your money into a project your money should be safe and then think about to make money but people in the market they they want to make money don't think about like oh I want to save my money as well no they operate their think oh I want to make money I'll buy you will lose man all the time if you are having this approach or I I want to make money I'll buy something all the time you will lose money in the market man okay I have something for you guys there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP a group I have I post two signals every single day through which you can make daily profit so I gave a coin that buy R if you haven't joined the VIP I know most of you who are watching this video have joined the VIP but still if there is someone who haven't joined yet just DM me I'll be adding you in the group the small WhatsApp number we bought Ray 0.1 was our buying price what happened since we bought Ray it pmed 10x man your $10,000 you could have turned into $100,000 in profit with Ray toen if you haven't joined just TM me on what what I'll be adding you in the VIP in the CP Man daily signals daily profit you can make in my VIP this small WhatsApp number let's come back to our topic man what's going on with dog yeah it's in downtrend it's making lower low one hour time frame it's be man no way we should be taking trade in this to 4our time frame no like see this exit liquidity exit liquidity it's going will be back to like maybe um half a Cent and then like 0.00 so so so stay stay away stay away man it's dying this token is dying and if you are buying now you will lose everything in the market I wish you all the best I'll let you know when to buy but this token stay away man that's all I can say that's what people talk about this toen man because there is no any good sign we have neither it's on coin base not Kraken any other major exchange so Wales will not even pump this token because they Wales want the exit liquidity and if a coin is not in big exchange how like why one whale a group of whales will put their money into a project no like that never happened in 15 years of Bitcoin history man for 10 years I have been doing this and I have and I haven't come across something like that and there's no point man I haven't seen that I have I went into like

happened with the Jupiter price the jup token is down more than 60% in the last few months let's have a look why that happened and let's try to find out whether or not this can turn around because it doesn't look like adoption is the problem the total value locked measured ins Solana tokens continues to rise measured in US Dollars it's not that different and yes parts of that 60% decline are due to the Solana price going down because this here is Jupiter relative to so but that still went down by 37% so since April all of crypto didn't do too well Solana went down as well but Jupiter went down more why is that now here's one explanation there's an upcoming unlock happening for jup we currently have 1.3 billion jup tokens but 1 month from now this could almost double it's not the relative standing of Jupiter within the Solana ecosystem because have a look at the share of organic trading volume Jupiter is in turquoise and yes this is not necessarily Rising but the drop was from 69% to 58% it definitely doesn't warrant an underperformance of that magnitude so yes token unlocks for Jupiter are bad in expanding Supply is bad but I think the main driver for that underperformance is that Jupiter is a bet on attention not on price levels but on attention when attention on crypto is high trading volume is high when trading volume is High Jupiter profits now have a look at this chart this is the number of Jupiter swaps per week and this peaked out at the beginning of June and since that Peak we only see half of the number of swaps I have a look at the trading volume that didn't Peak at the beginning of June but at the middle of March so have a look at the number of swaps relative to the trading volume there was still a lot of swaps up until recently but those are comparatively smaller swaps most of capital moved in March of this year and when we look at the relative performance of Jupiter to Solana it did Peak 2 weeks after the trading volume Peak so at the beginning of April and so because of that the fees that are collected through Jupiter also tend to decline now again the secondary trading volume Peak had been generated by small money if we actually exclude this we can see that the big money trades peaked already in March and all of those developments are also reflected in the number of jup token holders over time so initially there was the airdrop right this was the allocation to all kinds of holders then we've seen people selling their airdrop up until the beginning of March and then once those sales stopped Jupiter outperformed Solana by 100% mainly driven by small retail but also mediumsized retail and whales bought a bit and since then we don't see much growth in the number of holders by the way on the left side is the number of retail investors so 1,000 tokens minimum holding at the current price at $712 in the middle we go a 10x on that so that's $7,000 on the right we look at the Wales that's 70,000 holders in the middle we've got a minimum holding of $7,000 on the right we've got the Wales that's a minimum holding of $70,000 so none of the cohorts are buying the price initially declined is now somewhat flat in the last few weeks but it looks like the downwards trend is quite stable it doesn't look like Jupiter can recover very quickly Jupiter was riding the wave of Solana and the issue is that the air for Solana itself is getting thin so what we've got over here is the so dominance so not the Solana price but the measure of Solana's market cap as a fraction of all of crypto and that's currently at 3.1% it peaked out at 3.6% and in the past when we were at those kinds of levels Solana was able to underperform the rest of crypto by more than 80% so that's a potential risk we are taking on by buying so now and again I believe that Jupiter is a levered bet on that Trend if Solana itself is going down trading activity is probably going down as well and then Jupiter will not only go down in US dollars but also measured in s so you can see I'm not just advertising cryptocurrencies I try to keep it as real as objective as possible if you appreciate this feel free to give this a like and feel free to

#beercoin #beer #crypto","the beer coin meme token on Solana is quite a bit of an underdog I published a video on the token 5 days ago since then the price went up but the overall Dynamics around the token have changed quite a bit let's have a look at the onchain data most people are not considering but first what I want to share is data you definitely do not have access to and that's my YouTube analytics I like to look at the YouTube analytics of any video that I publish to get a gauge how much retail interest is there for a token because if a lot of people are still searching for the token that means that those searches can in the end translate into purchases if nobody cares about the token anymore and the price is unlikely to go up except when there is manipulation by the Wales so here is that video performance bcoin first underperformed a typical video so the typical video is in Gray then the search volume took over there's still search traffic now it's slightly outperforming the price at the time of publish was .14 now the price just after a few days is at17 so we continued to see a bit of a rally but now we are consolidating why is that let's check out the onchain metrics we see here the number of firsttime Traders versus recurring Traders for every single day since launch and initially we saw more first-time Traders than recurring Traders that's exactly what you want you want to see an expanding base of investors because as there are more and more investors jumping on a mem coin the price tends to go up as long as the whales aren't dumping however we have seen a flip on the 1st of June suddenly the number of recurring Traders exceeded the number of first-time Traders and the 1 of June is over here so this is when the price couldn't really anymore that's when the ready stopped have a look at this chart this is the trading volume divided by different wallet segments small retail is the wallets that have less than $1,000 in the token mediumsized retail is from 1,000 to 10,000 large retail is above 10,000 and the Wales is above 100,000 and so when we look at that split we can see that overtime small retail and mediumsized Retail overtook more and more of the trading volume the Wales and large retail declined in the trading volume so we don't see a lot of new people jumping on the token and we don't see how the whales are engaged in the token anymore the side movement in the price is quote unquote fundamentally driven and so what matters a lot in mem coin trading is timing you want to be early and I found the easiest way to be early is to look at wallets that tended to be early with other tokens in the past to look for example at influencer wallets to look at when are various YouTube influencers or Twitter influencers buying we try to find their wallets through some onchain magic but more on that later we figure out those wallets we track those wallets then we buy with those wallets and then when a tweet happens when a YouTube video happens when a lot of attention gets to an asset that's when the price Rises and that's then when we sell so you want to be early by following the very smart money so let me show you how that works one week ago influencer James win bought quite a lot of the endd token now this is not the regular indd token on the base chain this is another indd token on ethereum and this is one of his purchases I'm not going to scroll through this chat now because this is part of Premium but we got several alerts of James WI buying this Indy token he has now $200,000 worth of the token and so I'm sharing my trades as well and I shared how I copy traded James win here and there were several reasons for that for example the number of holders was developing very nicely he tended to time the token very well in the past he bought low and sold high he had 20% of his $2 million portfolio in the token and the token had very little risk in terms of its smart contract so it's not a honey pot and so I bought over here we got our secondary rally here a lot of trading volume the price went up by 80% and that happened again in the span of a few days so it's very very important to follow the smart money follow the influencers that are early either have their wallets or maybe look at Twitter accounts that mention a certain token and mention it before the rally so you don't want to buy a token after it has already risen you want to buy a token when nobody talks about it and you want to be very careful at creating your information sources because again most Traders underperform only a few Traders are able to outperform consistently and simply copy trading those people makes a lot of sense doing the same trades as the winners is a winning strategy I will continue to make updates on various mem coins on this channel so if you're interested in that feel free to subscribe a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow and if your crypto portfolio isn't yet large enough

seems to be one of the only meme coins that is rapidly rising in the cryptocurrency space right now you can see over the last kind of month here um how it has had its swings its ups and downs but if you look over the last year and kind of go back to June and may of 2024 this is where the exponential growth really was ready to happen and you can see just over the last kind of since August which is very recent to be fair this coin has rocketed really really gone up from 0.009 up to 0.024 so that's a 3X I want to talk about who is potentially controlling this coin is it just a whale manipulation is it worth getting into and also show you guys some other meme coins in the crypto space right now that I think have even more potential and some very very big Alpha behind them so subscribe if you're new here stay tuned in and let's talk about Giga Chad so 0.024 right now of for $221 million Market Capital the circulating Supply is 92% which is a good thing because you're not going to get a large injection of Supply which will create a shock on the price effectively diluting the value of each token now looking at Giga Chad the overall mainstream retail accessibility we're looking at radium Meteora we've got a few dexes right and and a couple centralized I wouldn't really call these good centralized exchanges mexe though you know I I dig them very good exchange but the others I'm not super keen on but most of the volume I guess is coming from from what looks like the radium decks anyway which is absolutely fine so this is a salana meme coin we know the salana kind of DJ and Salan ecosystem has a very big appetite for risk and lots of these coins can do well but a lot of them can also go south very very quickly Giga Chad it says John Phil the wick chapter 3 so Giga Chad is this kind of crazy meme coin right here it says the gigachad meme on slana the big one what is giga Giga chat is a meme that has been around for years that is now worldwide phenomenon so yeah could be one that does get continuation we know that the price is rocketing at current time so one thing I do want to do is is just check one thing first so you know what am I going to check when I look at a coin you know first things first straight off the bat I will scroll down on Dex tools and check the Dex t score 99 of 99 is always a very very green flag now I can tell just from looking at what's going on here and these buys that they are potentially deploying a volume bot or a micro bot which is absolutely fine and what this effectively does it allows the coin to Trend and get tons of sells and buys over a 24-hour period so it's got a higher chance of trending to the retailer um but yeah we can see by the quantities here it does look like there could be some sort of Bot deployed you know fine typical crypto sort of marketing 101 liquidity is nice at 2.84 million the overall MC is 230 million here and one thing to just verify the size of the community because we got 11.5k holders so how do we verify these holders well what we could do is we can just quickly head over to um the soul scan we can see they've got 11.5k holders so how many Twitter followers should they had it should be in the region of that as well well 99.4k followers you could assume maybe not every holder is followed but this does tell me as well that it's very unlikely that this Twitter is botted right here um so yeah so far gigachad is looking pretty good um in terms of its overall analysis looking at the holding distribution you can see there aren't many wallets of over 1% we don't know how centralized these wallets are we don't know how Affiliated these wallets are all of these wallets could be owned by the same small circle of people which is can be quite likely so that's one thing you've got to consider is it a close network is it a bunch of VCS is it a bunch of whales that like I say control $20 million worth of the supply something you do have to think about when you do look into a mem coin because you know it only takes one person to destroy a chart but just looking at Giga chat you know it has been explosive exponential and on the day even now it is just up up up and going absolutely parabolic so yeah one I just picked up on just looking and doing some research today so big pump wouldn't chase the green candle we can see a bit of a slant on the volume here on the daily time frame um and if we could just check that 1 hour volume what's going on it is dipping a little bit as well on the 1 hour volume really really big pump probably would not want to chase this green candle however because it has already pumped and obviously what looks looks like a great entry would have been at 0.007 which then you would have over 2 3x gains so now the risk is a little bit too high would I just go and dump 10K into this right now probably not based on that information um but overall really cool ecosystem anyways uh what else do we want to talk about well we can see the top 10 holders uh they basically hold um this quantity of Giga tokens which is 1 billion Giga that's 10% of the total Supply we can see the max Supply is 10 billion so that does also make sense so those top holders could be a small network of people holding about 10% of the overall Supply which is not a terrible thing but that's when that sort of uh centralization that feel of centralization comes in but I guess those funds could be you know maybe allocated for marketing and other things like that and here we can see again the list of who is holding so you can actually go into these owners these wallets you can have a look at the soul scan and you can do your own analysis on those addresses if you are ever sort of you know not too sure about you know if they connected or not and sometimes you can find and pick up on things so yeah Giga Chad really is a an interesting meme coin right now and it could still keep going up I'm not trying to FUD this one 221 mil on the MC with staggering volume at $10 million so of course this one has pumped quite a lot already now what I was to tell you that there could be another meme coin out there that's got even more potential than Giga Chad or maybe even another meme coin out there if you're already in Giga it could be worth holding another one right so want to very quickly just show you a coin first things first if you are new here check out my patreon group if you want to achieve Time Financial location Freedom make money from your laptop your phone check out my crypto Legend group where you're going to get trading signals and early hour for calls on Meme coins to get you into ones like this so this is top G 1,500 ladies and gents want to share it with you there is some huge news coming out for this coin by the way at 5:00 p.m UTC today so stay in the know rain check it or you know write it down on a bit of paper bookmark it or whatever because these charts could get very exciting soon now I got my Alpha group into to this coin not as early as I'd like but they are up still a decent 4X so I got them in around this purple rectangle over here and we can see we are starting to consolidate in this what looks like a symmetrical triangle range did have a recent massive volume blast but a lot of selling pressure CU there's a few selling orders around 4 million MC so we have come back down on the price but I do perceive that there will be another pump for top G500 now you're probably wondering okay what is this coin well actually this coin is a fully doxed and K1 YC developer who is moving fast to Romania he is walk Romania by foot from the United Kingdom to meet Andrew Tate and this is his story right here he's got 60k followers he's going to meet the tape brothers and this is big speculation is he going to meet Andrew Tate his coin is called top G 1,500 will and Tate then promote the coin this could lead it to grow 100x or something absolutely insane so it's really worth just speculating on this it's one of the hottest coins right now of a real strong narrative and story and we're really seeing that reflection here so MC of 2.77 million 181k on the liquidity 1.7k holders um and a dexal score of 81 out of 99 that could indeed be a little bit higher and I think um you know we'll see that go up over time as things consolidate more and the growth continues but yeah guys like I say this is a really really hot one um you can see look moraki crypto also retweeted so there is a kid who's walking from England to Romania and is currently 45 days in he's also a meme coin around it and that is the meme coin right here everyone so this is absolutely insane that we just wondering what's going to happen is he going to meet Andrew Tay and then we see these this this chart here just absolutely fly to the moon so it could go so high if that does happen so one thing to always speculate and see what could indeed happen for this particular coin um give him a like check them out down below Jay gorilla awesome developer we know that is Doc and KY seed in that sense as well the other coin is Pepe Unchained this will be launching very soon it's in an Ico phase 222% per an I'm on the staking what it is is a layer 2 infrastructure meme going it's going to have its own very dedicated block Explorer for Pepe um and when you click through you can see it's all about basically being Speedy high security low fees and of course meme coins one pepu is 0.009 you can buy on BNB as well you can switch networks and at 9 million raised the price will be going up again so if you want to secure some of these Pepe on chain tokens I'll leave a link down below of course it's an Ico it's a meme coin it's high risk High reward territory but sometimes does deliver good gains and on the staking side here is the staking dashboard where they're delivering 608 ethereum not ethereum God that would be a lot would it 68 pepu tokens per ethereum block so that's pretty decent as well and you can see the slow Supply release of rewards over time at the same time I think it's cool 10.7k followers lots of hype getting a lot of retweets and traction and following behind this particular coin so there's there's another one as well guys so check out the top G500 down below I think we could see this blast to $4 million MC very very soon it already did just needs to get back up there and of course Pepe on chain another one I'm bullish on Giga chat I think it could be cool and to be fair I can see it is available on mexc so if you would like to grab some of this Giga token use my mxc link down below you're going to

they drop so you can hit your crypto goals so just talking about render crypto it's important to set the context here in the overall scheme of artificial intelligence because render is very much positioned as an artificial intelligence token in the crypto space and if we zoom out and look at 2023 here and think about the most popular narratives from last year we can see that artificial intelligence was the most talked about narrative and the most popular Narrative of the entire year for 2023 and again zooming out outside of the crypto sphere in general we saw the rise of CHA gbt and open Ai and really the beginning of this allout artificial intelligence War among some of the world's largest corporations and on the back of Chachi BT on the back of open AI we saw a lot of popularity filtering into the crypto space when it comes to artificial intelligence and that narrative and the popularity of AI has continued well into 2024 so again just setting the context here it's important to understand where we are when we're talking about AI in general and what we're looking at here is volumes per narrative year to date for 2024 and as we can see mean coins has been the best performing Narrative of the year so far and in line with being the best performing narrative we can see that the volumes in the mean coins has been huge in 2024 so far however in second place only to the med coins is artificial intelligence in terms of volume being put through all the different AI tokens in 2024 thus far so Ai and The Narrative of AI and the amount of capital flowing through the likes of render as well as many of the other AI tokens is seconded only to mem coins in 2024 thus far so again the popularity of this narrative is not slowing down just yet and as I mentioned even recently we've seen the likes of Apple uh coming out with an AI integration and a partnership with chat GPT and Microsoft to further integrate artificial intelligence creating new and better versions of Siri on your mobile device where Siri is going to be leveraging AI to have a much more personalized experience for you as an end user and all of this is kind of coming back to the fact that we're seeing the largest corporations in the world Microsoft Google Facebook Apple all going to war to gain attention for the end consumer when it comes to artificial intelligence obviously we saw open Ai and chbt be essentially acquired by Microsoft earlier in the year and we know about Google bard and now we're seeing Apple making moves to create these Partnerships and create enhanced AI for Siri on mobile devices so lots of big moves being made and it's the fact that these corporations are the biggest corporations in the world Microsoft Apple meta and Google you know they know what's at stake when it comes to artificial intelligence we're moving into this new era of you know super computers and super computation that artificial intelligence is able to leverage and the other emergent winner in all of this has been Nvidia um the Chip And processor maker Nvidia who have hugely run up their overall Market capop over the past last couple of years they actually surpassed Apple just last week in terms of market cap before Apple jumped back to the number two spot but Nvidia were the second largest corporation in the world for a brief period last week getting over the two the 3244 trillion US market cap um valuation and again the reason I mentioned all of this but Invidia in particular is because many people are seeing and positioning render as the blockchain version of Nvidia and as we will see in a moment some of the stuff that they're talking about in terms of distributed GPU decentralized compute and they really are aiming to be that first mover of the best provider of decentralized GPU for blockchain technology and B to the blockchain and crypto industry what Nvidia is and has been over the past couple of years to the technology space so again the rise of AI and the sheer amount of computation that needs to happen you got to remember that when we're using these AI tools like chat GPT and CLA Google B they're using vast vast amounts of computational power on the back end to render and create all the different responses and prompt and process all the information it requires huge and vast amount of computational power Nvidia has served that lead over the past number of years in a centralized economy and render is trying to position themselves as the solution to the blockchain and AI rendering problem in a decentralized world and again just to zoom out finally to set the context here for the growth of the AI Market over the course of the next 5 to 10 years you know we're sitting in a valuation currently somewhere in the region of about 215 billion us for the AI Market here in 2024 and you can see how exponential we're about to go as we move towards the year 2030 going from a valuation of about 250 billion to over 1339 trillion us do between now and 2030 which really is only 5 and a half years away so the amount of growth we're going to see in Ai and artificial intelligence over the coming 5 years um it'll be even crazier to think about what this number will be by the time we get to 2035 could be something in excess of 2 trillion very easily but the amount of growth we're seeing already in the past 2 years and for the next 5 years is going to be exponential so jumping into render Network as we mentioned render are aiming to provide unlimited decentralized GPU computing power for the Next Generation Um and 3D content creation if we jump over to their website we can see Heather talking about the fact that they're wanting to advance the next generation of rendering and artificial intelligence technology distributed GPU rendering on the blockchain is what they're all about and again talking about the metaverse here we know that you know artificial intelligence and the metaverse again the sheer amount of computational power that's required for doing stuff like the metaverse or Distributing gaming in a decentralized fashion the GPU and the processing required to do all that is growing and growing and redder are aiming to solve this problem in a decentralized fashion but also by making that process and the compute more decentralized they're also trying to create um efficiencies of scale and reduce costs for users um institutions and businesses who are ultimately building these games these metaverses and these AI Solutions if they can significantly reduce the cost of GPU by making it more decentralized at doing in a blockchain manner they are going to entice more people to use their platform their blockchain because it's going to be much cheaper and much more cost effective than purchasing physical devices in order to do all of that GPU processing so again render is positioning itself to really capitalize and it has been capitalizing but to continue capitalizing on this AI boom if we jump over to the coin market cap top to see where render is currently sitting we are here recording this video on June 15th 2024 we can see the price of render is currently sitting at $8 us per render token we did do another price prediction video on the channel so make sure to check that out I will leave the link up here at the top of the screen for you but you can just search the channel for render price prediction and you will find that but again we can see how the price of Rand has gone from sub $1 back here in 2021 that we were here at the 90 cents level even going as low as 45 cents here in the middle of 2021 all the way up to a high very recently in March of 2024 at a above $13.5 and if we think about that from a market cap perspective as well we've gone from a market cap again back in 2021 of about 70 million us here in 2020 1 going all the way to a peak of over5 billion just a few weeks ago we are currently back down and we have retrace in line with this Market correction but we are sitting at a market cap today of about 3.1 billion US do for render it is the 29th largest cryptocurrency by overall market cap and in my opinion is very likely to become a top 20 crypto coin by the time time we get further into this bull market and by the time we reach the peak I definitely think this will be a top 20 crypto not Financial advice as always but again if we think about how render has been performing obviously we've gone from growth and seen even in October of this year we've gone sorry October of 2023 we went from a170 all the way up to above $13 as we said we're current back down to eight but if you were buying render in Q4 of 2023 and even as recently as January of this year you could have been picking up render sub $4 and done a 3X by the time we got up to the $13 Mark and if you were accumulating during this entire uh bare market for a 2022 you're probably in a very good position you could have been buying around that 50 c Mark and you would be up over 20x at this point so render when we compare it to bitcoin as well this is the render Bitcoin chart we can see how render has been outperforming Bitcoin over the past year and a half to two years as well because this channel here in between both of the yellow lines is a very strong price trending upward Channel we've got the one we chart here so every candle on this chart represents a one we time period and we go all the way back basically to the very start of 2022 where we saw this consolidation here on the render Bitcoin chart for a period of about half a year really before render really broke out against Bitcoin and we can see that since the beginning pretty much all the way since the very beginning of 2023 here in January for the past year and six months we've been in this upwards Trend with render significantly outperforming Bitcoin over that period of time and we still have not broken out of this channel it looks very strong and very healthy and one would you know it would lead one to believe that we will continue on this upwards trajectory as we move through the course of the next 12 to 18 months during this bull market so very very positive sentiment when it comes to render on how it has performed not just against the US dollar but showing us that it has been one of the strongest performers this bull cycle with very very good gains even when compared to bitcoin's Performance Bitcoin is up over 160% % and for the past year so render is outperforming Bitcoin significantly as we can see in the chart here and bods very very well for the next number of months so again we did a price prediction video on the channel you can go back and check out the specific details of the price prediction but I think render going to a 40 or 50 billion US market cap overall is definitely not out of the picture for this bull cycle especially if it becomes a top 20 crypto you know a lot of people are saying render could be a top 10 and if the AI narrative continues to hold very strong throughout the course of the next year I think it very much could get there uh and if it did you could be looking at something like 60 70 80 billion overall market cap for something like render again this is not Financial advice but you would have to be living under a rock to not see and understand the amount of attention and height that has been around artificial intelligence for the past 12 to 24 months and render has already been a benefactor of that and ridden that artificial intelligence wave over those past 12 to 18 months and you know The Narrative of AI continues to get stronger and stronger we have the world's biggest corporations at War for your attention when it comes to artificial intelligence and all of the making moves to get in front of you as a consumer and have you using their AI because the more people that use these platforms and these AI tools the more data that these corporations can continue to evolve the learning models on so they want people using them at any cost so we are at a war for your attention when it comes to artificial intelligence that war is not slowing down and render will continue to ride that wave of AI and you know depending on how strong that maintains over the course of the next 12 to 18 months we could very well see render become a top 20 crypto and possibly even a top 10 coin so let us know in the comments below where do you think render is going this bull cycle are you bullish on artificial intelligence are you holding render as part of your portfolio and where do you think we're going from here make sure to check out the other price prediction video for render on the channel I might need to do an updated version very very soon as always if you enjoy the content please smash that thumbs up button

Please do your own research before making financial decisions.,"is it worth buying CTI let's figure it out what's in the chart in the last 24 hours it dropped over 10% it's coming down man I already explained we have to wait in my last video and it's coming down I'm not like surprised oh it's coming down no it's normal man why healthy pullback is part of the game What's Going On Let's like go in Deep dive into CTI launched 0.088 cents was the price and prom they pumped over a dollar man $120 was the all time let me draw a horizontal line to make it visible and clear okay this was the top okay how we should go about it if I drag it down a bit because majorly from $1 $11 from here it dropped badly like badly what does that mean I'll highlight this man like flat sell we have seen flash sell massive sell off at once we have seen that how many okay now this is what happened how many ways do we have in the market to make money we have two ways to make money in the market first way once from the level like from this level from the level where we have seen a flash sale once we see closing above it $1 12 take a trade $15 buy but if you are buying now or bought at $1 $15 Cent less than $110 if you bought this token you deserve to lose money why because you a Gambling Man why did you buy oh I think price will go up technically chart was not indicating didn't have the basic knowledge oh I didn't know that then why you are taking trade in the market if you are taking trade make sure that you are playing professionally if there is a demand in the chart good to go buy you want to make money you will print money in the market but if you are buying oh I'll buy I'll make money why because it's in top it's going up I'll buy you will lose man why because you are gambling with your money in the last 10 years I haven't come across single person in the world I have 10,000 clients 15,000 contacts on WhatsApp I haven't come across a single person who made money in the market none by now okay before going in deep dive into CTI the other way we have the price prediction what should be our approach the fundamental yeah I have something for you guys before going in all those things there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP where I post two trades every single day 2 three days back from now I give a coin buy Saga I have a VIP daily signals daily profit $140 was our buying price of saga what happened since we bought Saga price is pumping nonstop price d trouble Man haven't joined the VIP this group if you haven't joined you not making money in the market you're buying the wrong ones in this VIP you're going to find all the right ones you're supposed to buy at the buying price not above buying price I'll be explaining that too man but if you want to join the VIP this group signals come to my profile crypto arov tap on the first link I have given the link tap on the first link say hi on WhatsApp and I will be adding you in my VIP daily signals daily profit man don't delay just join right now let's come back to our topic man CTI the first way we have once we see closing above the previous stop okay $12 $14 buy and make the most money out of it the other way we have once it found the bottom that didn't happen yet yeah it's dipping constantly man so we will wait we'll wait once I see it found the bottom I going to put an update in my VIP where in my group man it's finding the the dip man this this might be the dip once I see it found the dip I going to give an update exclusively in my group we cannot buy now we cannot like nobody in the world will disagree with me things I am explaining if you'll be following that you're going to make money in the market like nobody will say oh this guy is saying wrong no it's 100% technical man anyone who will watch my content one would appreciate it that's for sure it doesn't matter where one is living in which continent Asia Europe or like North America it doesn't matter man if you are watching this video from part of any part of the world one would appreciate it it's all professional all technical once I see it found the bottom we're going to go with big money because it's an opportunity we have in our hands personally if you ask me this token is trending globally man it's on X and if I just talk about the fundament is it's stop Notch everything is on point man market cap ain't much other coins has a big amount of market cap but it's trending man right the number one in the world right now yeah market cap is like low cap $250 million of market cap like low cap man most man out of millions it's in top 200 volume a much we're going to see big volume price is coming down so people are not taking trade in this token because it's in downtrend right now it's in downtrend it's making lower low we have to wait till the time it found the bottom it found the bottom after that it going to explode man yeah price going to pump nonstop I remember like a a coin called not token man launched in the market and it took 9 days C CTI it's been 24 to 48 hours 2 days only okay I remember coin of coin which launched in the market n I'll search over here n and that token what happened it took 9 days bro before price shocked the world like it took 9 days and then it pound 9x same goes with C CTI man once it found the bottom it going to pump 10x that's there man 10x profit we going to make out of C but we have to wait till the time it found the bottom it found the bottom we're going to put our money and price is going to pump nonstop but if you are buying now if it drops you will lose you deserve to lose money why because you are buying at a wrong buying level like not everyone makes money in the market only 1% people makes money in the market who have mastered the game the technical analysis if you have knowledge if you have experience you're going to make money in the market but if you are lacking in these two basic things you you are like lacking in knowledge don't have an idea oh I'll bu make money uh then you are gambling but if you have knowledge you've been in the game you have experience you're going

but there's one outlier the Bobo token that did run pretty well now let's have a look at who bought this token early let's have a look at onchain metrics who's buying who's selling let's try to find out what else they're holding to potentially find the next Bobo let's dive into the details this video can be understood as a tutorial we're going to look at different tools that I like to use how to identify wallets we're also going to look at the profit and loss statements of those wallets we're going to look at how to find their different Holdings let's dive into all of this now I've made a video on bobo just a few days ago and the video performed pretty much similar to any other video the gray area is a typical video the blue line is that bobo video and at the time the price was at 52291 now the price is at 5 2954 so that's just in the span of a few days if this is your first time hearing about Bobo then maybe consider following channels like this I tried to be early and I publish videos regularly now let's dive into those onchain metrics the first interesting thing is over here the buy and sell statistics so what we see is that there's way more buy transactions than sell transactions today we also see there's way more buyers than sellers today but at the same time we see how the buying volume as in the US dollar amount is pretty equal to the selling amount that's why we only saw an 11% increase today in other words the sellers tend to move more Capital than the buyers or in other words the whales are selling the whales are taking profit the people that bought in early are selling now let's dive a bit more into the details so check this out here's a whale that sold two times 1 hour 9 minutes ago the wallet sold $25,000 roughly worth of the token and so let's filter by that whale let's click on the filter button and see his buying and selling Behavior he bought very very early very nicely he sold at Peaks bought in again and now is on a selling spree again is this a wallet potentially worth following was this just a lucky shot with Bobo or is this in general a Trader that tends to make money in crypto we can have a look at the profit and loss statement online as well so there's a tool called Arham intelligence and in Aram we can plug in the address of that wallet we can see that the wallet has a 1.7 million profit balance and a lot of this had been made during the initial Ico boom of 2018 we can also have a look at the current Holdings of that wallet for that we go to db.com and in dbank we plug in again that address the address currently holds roughly $700,000 worth of crypto Bobo still has $80,000 worth but there's also iOS there's M there's agx a quite interesting Diversified wallet another way to find interesting Traders is to look at the top Trader tab in IND dexc screen.com so again we are at Dex screener and here is the top Trader Tab and here we can see what kind of wallets made most money with Bobo unfortunately we do see a lot of wallets that simply just made money by selling not by buying in other words those kind of wallets simply got a token allocation early on it might be parts of the team it might be parts of early investors that bought outside of the decentralized exchanges it might be traders that are using pools but it's not just simple decentralized exchange trading so this is another potential source of alpha figuring out if there's interesting buyers and sellers but I'm always interested in the Insiders I'm interested in the people that got the token very early I'm also interested in potential influencers that might get a token allocation that then sell after releasing a video so this is what the premium membership of this channel is all about right we try to find influencer wallet through various means there's even a dedicated tutorial on how to find influencer wallets we try to find those influencer wallets try to see when they are buying something then we buy with the influencer and then we wait for that influencer to release a video and when the video gets released of course the price shoots up because there's a lot of new attention on the token and then we sell so that's the idea of wallet tracking right we want to be early we want to have a market Advantage so if you're interested in that feel free to check it out it's the bitcoin.com link is down below let's now have a look at the Insiders within the project so that's again from a tool that's available to the premium members there is one table that show the first 5,000 total receival transactions so there were 1,500 such wallets this is very likely Insider wallets right those are the wallets that got the token the first and we can simply again click at those wallets and check out what are they currently holding so this particular wallet is holding pretty much nothing and so there is a bit of work involved but especially the first wallets are very likely insiders there's another table this is the table of the first trades so instead of the talken receivers we're now looking at the trades that's now executions on decentralized exchanges and what I find interesting here and what is very specific to Bobo is I'm scanning the first 10,000 transactions but when we look at those first 10,000 trades on those decentralized exchanges we don't see 10,000 wallets doing this the first 10,000 trades had been done by only 98 wallets is this wash trading is this legitimate I don't know but this relationship is very suspicious right it's on average 100 trades per wallet and again that's for the very first 10,000 trades that lasted up until the 8th of June let's have a look at the wallets that traded so early we've got one that still holds Bobo has a bit of custa and pepet he has another wallet also still holding Bobo but also a bit of torsi not that interesting but here's a rather interesting wallet this wallet has $600,000 roughly of crypto and that early Trader in Bobo doesn't hold any Bobo anymore but he does hold a lot of the Palm token half a million worth of palm I've never heard of palm before let's check out the p&l of this wallet it's currently at plus 600k was at a million at one point and this is the Palm token very little attention on that token right now a very low price as well there is a buy and sell tax of 3% each so that's not great there is a somewhat professional website around this as well with of course an influencer pumping this this is altcoin daily one of the largest crypto channels on YouTube but yeah that's the kind of information we can get from blockchain analytics right we can see that a whale in Palm somebody that still has half a million worth of palm was an early Trader in Bobo as well so again I like to follow the winners I like to follow wallets like this I personally like to follow influencer Traders not necessarily only good Traders because for influencers we have a direct connection between the promotion and the price development for top Traders we don't necessarily always know the source of the alpha right if they are just lucky or if they actually have Insider information so yeah the first 10,000 trades on Bobo are a bit suspicious I'm not really sure what happened there I am somewhat cautious I don't hold any Bobo I'm not planning to buy any Bobo but I will continue to make make updates on the tokens so if you want to follow those updates feel free to subscribe I publish videos regularly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow if you don't yet want to sign up for premium there's also a free telegram link is as well down below looking very much forward to chatting with you there",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf9x1_Tmxg8,"['JUST', 'WHY',

Please do your own research before making financial decisions..","hi everyone last 3 days clv remains in top five in top gner that's a real I cannot put into words really we come across coin like this which remains in top five in bull market in top gner that's sural I have been doing for 10 years now binance it's in the game since 2017 month of May so it's been like 3 four like okay approximately 8 years now 7 to 8 years now bro it's a real is it worth buying let's figure it out what's in the chart how we should go about it we're going to go deep dive into this token man and we are one breakout away already I have talked about this token I'm not against of far in like in this token I'm just saying what's in the chart my job is to break it down what's there I don't have any preconceived notion or bias towards a token man no it's all in the chart once I see price breaks 0.15 I going to buy I going to buy clv if price breaks 0.15 once I see price breaks this level closing above it take a trade 0.155 B that's how you're going to make money in the market but but if you are buying now that's how you're going to make money in the market let me finish yeah so okay is it worth buying no of course not until unless we don't see that price breaks this level price breaks 0.15 we cannot buy we cannot we cannot afford to buy that's not what chart is indicating but if you're going to buy I oh I'll buy I'll make money it'll be back and you will lose why because now I'll explain you why why you will lose what happened over here what happened it form what does what what does that mean this two indication this two candles what does it indicate that we are extremely bearish technically chart is indicating it'll be dropping it'll be dropping twice it formed over here mostly you going to see one pattern that twice it Formed double top I want to Give an example to explain you a coin called us it launched in the market 2 days back from now and what happened one thing in common you going to find in this token as well if I remove everything same like okay in in 1 hour time frame can we see okay see this see this okay fine we can see in a smaller time frame as well we can view it properly it Formed double Top O once and then again it Formed double top again it Formed double top the most beer is flag it crashed price dropped massively man it crashed and same goes with clv as well it Formed double top double top twice and it when coin form double top a coin form double top or maybe form like present tense man okay fine if a coin is forming double top what does that mean it'll be coming down so we need closing man closing this is the level okay 0.15 we need closing out of this we need closing out of this once we see closing out of it it'll be extremely bullish I'll be pumping a lot price prediction for clv $1 for shortterm bare minimum $1 yeah clv yeah this this is a big one $1 is on the way but we are one breakout away once price breaks this level I am going to go with big money and it looks like it's taking time man it's taking time it's currently it's a bearish man Frankly Speaking I won't lie about this it's bearish technically that's what chart is indicating but it's there in top five it's there in top five so if we see price breaks because I have seen I'll be giving one more example guys and that token pumped a lot so so that going to be like really useful to understand because me like if I'm awake I'm in the charts 24/7 this is like I live for the market I'm the most active guy you guys will ever come across on the internet okay there are many coins which are going up in the market would you like to know which one to buy today I have a VIP where I post two trades every single day through which you can make daily profit I gave a coin that buy 0.17 was our buying price what happened since we bought this to if I just show you over here since we bought price pumped 25x your $11,000 you could have turned $25,000 by now 25 times you could have made money okay even USU did we buy bro all the information when to buy when to sell you going to get over here us a l okay okay fine this token launched and what did I say that don't buy the top I'll let you know we'll let you know when to buy 37 cents what happened price crashed because it Formed double top so without knowledge no way you're going to make money in the market it's the basics man these are the basics things but technically you have to deal with lot of things graph is simple with clv and this token as well graph is very simple yeah I want to give an example as I said okay if you want to join the VIPs DM me on Whatsapp say hi I'll be adding you into my VIP okay fine I want to give an example t r y this token was right there which was like pump oh my God it's at 0.45 oh my God it's surreal man I did not expect it to be like oh herey but this toen it's is there at the top oh my God see this this was the bottom 0.01 and from there it pumped up to 6 Xmen and and one thing which was common with t y it was there for five to 10 days it was there in top gner same goes with clb man last couple of days it's right there maintaining the volume trading volume is really high if I if I open over here and just show you the the amount of volume we are getting over here in this token man in this crypto project clv okay it's right there I want to search Mark see this volume it's consistent what does that mean what's indic what does it's indicating that trading volume is really high we are just one breakout away once we see price breaks this level it'll be massive massive like massive parabolic move $1 in short term for longterm $10 will come into the picture so okay if you bought earlier like in that case if you have been holding this token in that case keep in hold don't watch any content don't take any from anywhere if you have been holding for long term if you have that Vision oh I'll be keeping keeping keeping hold this token keeping for longterm good to go good to go man then in that case if you have been holding for long term like bro hold it man in that in that case wait it'll be maybe it'll be back if you don't mind it'll be back because technically chart is indicating that that it it can get back if you want to buy in that case I can say I can give you the best setup because we play professionally whenever we take a trade if you if if you just name a coin I'm going to just show you over here you name a coin Dodge maybe ad maybe xrp you name a coin I'm going to show you whenever we buy we buy at the bottom that's how we would we make money in the market always always whenever we buy there must be a reason might be at the dip or breakout but there must be a reason and that's how 98% accurate signals I provide over here I'm the best in the world I have made millions of dollars and now really I make mistake in the last 2 three years I made one mistake one or two really like where yeah I have made like maybe more than two but most of my money when I put in a token I don't make mistake like most of my money when I just go with big money I don't make mistake because I play professionally I made mistake initial five years 5 years I made all the mistake I made all the mistake which you can possibly think of all the mistake by buying into D5 space staking everything I did whatever like weird thought you can think of I did everything initial 5 years and then last 5 years I have been making money yeah okay how we should go about it the let's talk about the setup now when to buy so if you have been following this token uh wait for breakout man wait for breakout after breaking out take a trade if it goes up okay let's take the best scenario first if it goes up from here goes up from here closing above it 0.15 five b after breakout good to go take a trade don't hesitate buying after breakout don't hesitate because after that it'll be pumping up to $1 $1 bare minimum fine if it goes up upside if it comes downside then in that case we're going to buy over here 0.6 perfect man if I draw a horizontal line 0.06 B away perfect man yeah either buy at the dip either buy at the dip or after breakout both ways you're going to make money but my thing is that if you are buying the top it will drop and you will lose half of your money you will sell meanwhile when it will be dropping maybe you bought it don't do that man don't buy something at the top at the middle no buy at the buying price or after breakout that's how you're going to make money in the market or else okay else see the downside now why I'm saying you will lose because if it'll be back see okay I want I want to explain you guys take give me a minute this will be the best content that you guys will ever come across for sure but technically man pure technically I have talked about over 5,500 cryptos as of now I have made video that much so I have seen enough and okay if it'll be back then it'll be staying over here it'll be staying for like then your money will get stuck it's stuck at the at the bottom yeah it'll be fluctuating then in that case it'll be taking some some time and then it'll be trying to breaking out but if it goes upside if it goes upside when you buy the dip you have to hold I am not like suar coating things without any like biased I'm giving an opinion man not opinion it's the fact that's how crypto works if it'll be back it'll be taking some time taking some time it'll be trying it'll be trying to break if it won't it'll be coming down but once we get the confirmation if it goes up straight up closing above it bro buy you can go with big money because why because right after the breakout do you know how things going to be playing out right after the breakout it'll be pumping massive that's the difference man see this is the difference and when I say it's 100% accurate things I'm saying it's not like I think or this it's 100% accurate nobody in the world will disagree with me what I'm talking about literally nobody anyone who has a knowledge will not disagree with because what I'm saying but being in the market for 10 years I have the accurate knowledge and this is how things works that's how I made my money and if you'll follow someone who have been making money you're going to make money as well I wish you all the best price prediction for clv $1 us 1010 I wish you all the best have a nice day cheers guys",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqql3jUd_JQ,"['XRP', 'JUST', 'WHY',

üü¢What is Solama Meme Coin üöÄ Crypto Token Analysisüíµ,"üü¢ Solama Meme Coin | In-Depth Crypto Token Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è Solama is a meme cryptocurrency operating on the Solana blockchain. Like many meme coins, Solama taps into internet culture with a lighthearted, community-focused approach, aiming to provide high-risk, high-reward opportunities for investors drawn to the meme coin trend. Built on Solana, Solama enjoys the blockchain's fast and low-cost transactions, making it more accessible for frequent trading.  üöÄ What Is Solama? Solama is a meme token that emphasizes community engagement, social media buzz, and the appeal of dog-themed tokens popularized by coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). It is part of the Solana ecosystem, leveraging the blockchain's efficiency to offer low transaction fees, which is appealing to small-scale and meme-focused investors.  Solama doesn't have inherent utility beyond its community and meme-driven nature, making it a speculative investment that relies primarily on market sentiment and social media influence.  üìà Key Features of Solama Solana Blockchain Advantages: Solana offers high transaction speeds and low fees, positioning Solama as a convenient token for frequent trades and micro-transactions. Community-Driven: Solama's value relies heavily on the support and activity of its community. Meme coins often build value through dedicated holders who participate in social media promotions and viral marketing. Tokenomics and Deflationary Measures: Some meme coins incorporate token burning or redistribution mechanisms to control supply. Solama may implement similar strategies to potentially increase the token's value by reducing its supply. Viral Marketing Potential: Meme coins like Solama benefit from social media virality. If Solama can gain a strong following, it could experience price rallies due to online hype. üîç Factors Influencing Solama's Price Market Sentiment: Meme coins are sensitive to shifts in sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Positive engagement can drive price spikes, while negative sentiment can lead to rapid declines. Influencers and Community Growth: Endorsements from crypto influencers can lead to a surge in interest and value. As the community grows, Solama's price may increase proportionally. Solana Ecosystem: Solana's continued growth could benefit Solama. With more users adopting Solana-based projects, Solama has potential exposure to a broader audience. ‚öñÔ∏è Risks of Investing in Solama Volatility: Meme coins like Solama are known for high volatility. Prices can skyrocket with viral interest but may also drop quickly if interest wanes. Speculative Investment: Meme coins usually lack functional utility, making them heavily dependent on community hype. Competitive Market: With a large number of dog-themed tokens, Solama will need strong marketing and community backing to stand out. üîÆ Is Solama Worth the Investment? Solama may appeal to those who enjoy high-risk, high-reward investments and are interested in the Solana blockchain's efficiencies. However, as with all meme coins, investing in Solama is highly speculative. It's essential to stay informed, keep a close eye on market trends, and only invest what you're comfortable potentially losing.  #Solama #MemeCoin #Solana #Crypto2024 #CryptoReview #SolamaCoin #CryptoAnalysis #MemeCoinTrends #SolanaCrypto #CryptoGems","hello all cryptay lovers with you cryptomation today review Salam coin meme salam this ma'am koin ma'am koim on salan has this chart as you can see and has a current price 1 cent 1 cent uh capitalization of this project 12 000 000 here is the cast capacity in the region of 1,000,000 where can I buy this project at Market we go see most movements 60% it goes reddiom 17% goes max and Winx goes almost you can say 1% still raid and Max in 1st place here such here memcoin let's figure out what solama is which has quite a perspective prospect to rise at least take 10 texts now from the start it has 4 414% so lets watch go to the site very very simple site on salime see just 1 page and all link to X on Twitter and for purchase Eneftishki limit on enefteshka everything else there is nothing here very simple website aa go to dec screamer and see here uh total number of coin holders 25 800 liquidated here I spoke in raine 800,000 here has such a good schedule as for me coin started by since by 2 0 1 now stands 1 0 and 1 and in peak and peak she took 15 so at least at least half is how much 5 6 x off she may well raise raise Do not miss the opportunity to enter this coin as early as possible it costs very, very cheap move on contract on the contract also brought out the same 25,000 Market cap uh capitalization 12 000 000 and price 0 1 here comes the movement 4 minutes ago 5 minutes 8 10 buy sell by the way on dexkinel you can see that now went a small small movement like this what you see motion went up and at any moment it will fly up go on move on 25,000 is who's here 25,010% hapanul mex and 2% wallet 1 more wallet 1 more wallet again mex shorter mex here has his hand you can say so go to bulyx and see by the number so that's the graph here and here there are such comrades who have by 700 by 600 by 400 is this even a bot of some kind well bot whale that has 200 k coin go on we go to arhab on arham you can also see that this wallet has 27,000 of them 27 000 salam is on this wallet here is such is the information that pretty still not bad they have also here uh safety let's really safety safety staged 81% pretty still good good indicator Brands 93 Decentralization 81 Safety 95 overall score 81 good grade here's a good grade for assalama so as for me here is a good racker raccher on salami what will say everything is fine everything here is fine and normal top holders have 17% of all coins see how me and said mex mex has almost 9 here almost 10% well and probably more they have the lion's share here 17% all coins oo sense 10 go on aa go to Twitter what's on twitter on twitter as we see aa 32,000 roughly speaking 23 started Twitter has 32,000 followers here's a pinned post July 16th and the last an hour ago please an hour ago they updated and as you can see as I said now there is an accumulation and will fly and the rocket should fly so don't miss out your opportunity to purchase a salad so cheap yet this is not a financial set this is mine recommendation review of this coin meme Salama well like that fasting is irregular movement and seeing that there will be growth well like that Coin Market Cap there is see all all indicators what is going accumulation accumulation accumulation must be growth Telegram uh in telegram 2 600 well roughly speaking overall score as on cyberscope she practically matches here's a good indicator 81% safety and a good schedule as we see on coinmarketcap he pushed back and went higher so here is such a review ma'am of a coin on a salana salab name thank you all for your attention if you liked this video put like subscribe to my channel with y'all had cryptomac everyone thanks bye",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxWe4OjI7aw,['JUST'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxWe4OjI7aw/hqdefault.jpg,2024-10-26T16:30:08Z

People are very disappointed. The price is falling a lot and what should people do now? Those who have sold it after seeing the update on our telegram, they are very happy. The price that we had said, the same price has been launched. And those who have not sold it, what should they do now? And can the price of Hamster go up to 1 rupee or 1 dollar? This is a very big question of people. I will talk about it. There will be many more important things that will teach you to make profit in this video. Yes, welcome back to my channel guys. This is Bujjil Vyas and I hope you all are doing well. And you all are healthy too. Stay healthy and stay happy. Here, we will talk first about how Hamster Combat is falling. It has gone up to 0.14, that is 1 rupee 25 paisa. Its price has gone up to 1.25 rupees. It can go up to 60 paisa, the possibility of which is still visible. When I am shooting the video, it is falling. 0.0071, its price is 0.0071. If you multiply it by 89, then its price is 0.63 paisa. And when we sold it, it sold for 90 paisa and 1 rupee and 1 rupee 10 paisa. When we put a notification on CryptoTalks that you can sell it now. The price is going up on Binance. It is completely up to you. Now, those who have held it, they have a question. Can Hamster go up to 1 rupee again or not? You will have to wait for a while. Within 2-4 days, you can see its price getting appreciated again. And you can start making profit in it. Now, the question is, can it go up to 1 dollar? I got a comment yesterday. Why didn't Hamster launch it at 1 dollar? It would have been beneficial for us. They didn't see our benefit. So, launching it at 1 dollar is not in the hands of Hamster. There is a calculation behind everything. Try to understand that calculation. Then you will understand things. I will give you a small example. Take BNB here. The price of BNB is 605 dollars. Now, what is its market cap here? 88 billion. What is behind 88? There are 9 digits. And what is its circulating supply here? 145 billion. Its circulating supply is 145 million. I am sorry. Its circulating supply is 145 million. Now, what you have to do here is, In the market cap, You have to divide it by 145 million BNB. Because this is the BNB. It is not the amount. This is the amount. You have to divide the supply in this. Now, instead of 88, If I put 9 zeros behind 88, it will be fine. I am explaining for the sake of calculation. I will put 9 zeros behind 88. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I have put 9 zeros. Divide by what? Divide by this particular number. Its circulating supply. It can be this much BNB. It means that this much dollars are flowing in the current. It has the available market cap. And this is its supply. I will make 145 equal to 146. Because the next number is 9. After 146, I will put 6 zeros. Just to make it easy. 146 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Equals to, the price will be 602.7. Almost the same price as the BNB. There are not much changes. This is the calculation. Now, you have to do the same calculation in Hamster. Hamster has a market cap of 459 million. 459 million. After 459, I will put 6 zeros. After 459, I will put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 zeros. Divide by what? Divide by this circulating supply. 64 billion. After 64, I have to put 9 zeros. After 64, I have to put 9 zeros. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. What is the price? 0.0071. This is the price of Hamster. Check here. 0.0071. Our calculation is perfect. Now, let's understand what will happen if this goes to $1. $1 means, from here, it will have to go 95 times. Because it is running at the current price. Let's assume that it is running at Rs.1. Even then, it will have to go 90 times. To go 90 times, the situation that will be created in the market, try to understand that. Try to see what will be the market cap. The market cap is Rs.461. After Rs.461, put 6 zeros. After Rs.461, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And how much into? I will say, 90 times, minimum. Minimum 90 times. 90 times. 3, 3, 6, 3, 9. Market cap of 41 billion. Market cap of 41 billion. Do you know who has the market cap here? After XRP, the next number, that is, to come in the top 6 of Hamster, that is not possible. It is not possible to go to the market with such a coin alone. The total value of the market is 1 trillion. Right? Right now, it is running at 2 trillion. 2.29. So, it is double of 1 trillion. It is not a situation of 10 times or 90 times. So, it is easy to understand. If the market cap of 1 billion is 100 billion, the supply is 100 billion, then according to the supply, how much money will it have to throw in the market. And it is not possible to throw so much money here. You will try to understand all these things. And the whole game of circulating supply and market cap, by the time you understand it, it will be too late. It is better to forget it for now. You are holding it. You will get a profit in the coming time. It will go up to 1 or 1.5 rupees. It can go up to 2 or 3 rupees. It is not a big deal. We can see the pump in this coin in this market due to the hype. So, for now, leave the money in it. It is well and good. And if you have sold it and you want to sell it and you want money in the bank, then register on the link of CoinD6. Leave all these things. No one needs this Torn coin. It is your mistake that you transfer coins in Torn Keeper or Telegram Wallet even after explaining so much that you can do it on Binance, Bybit or anywhere. But don't do it there because it delays for 8-10 days. You don't get a chance to sell coins there at the right time. And it is a very small amount. You don't have to worry that you are worrying so much that you will have to sell it later on the exchange. So, it is better to go to Binance rather than somewhere else. I have put the link of Binance in the description. So, sell any other coming airdrops. And if you want to buy good airdrops, I have put all the links in the description. Do check them out. There is a link in the description box. I am putting only one link in the description box. Click on that link. Check if you have joined a drift party or a dog in hood or a cat. Check everything. Join what you haven't joined. I will explain everything. And do join the Binance Moonbix and Blum if you want to make good money. You will get very less money in the rest. You won't get much money. I am explaining it again and again. And for long term, make some money in 10 projects. Invest in Bullrun and make a profit of 3-4 lakhs. And you will grow further. I have explained all this in the last live video. Watch the last 20 minutes live video. Everything will be clear. How much money you can put in which coin. And how much you can make by investing little by little. I have explained everything in the last live video. Do watch it. If you have liked the video, like it. If you want to make lakhs or 1 lakh or 50,000, then you can neither like nor subscribe to this channel. But if you want to know how to make real things and make profit, then like the video and comment. If you have any doubt, I will give you a solution. If you are new to the channel, subscribe.

"Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains, and the Future of the Internet","5 years after his first documentary on the topic, award-winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann revisits the big brains and big egos behind Bitcoin and Blockchains in this thought-provoking and entertaining crash course about the controversial technology.","(audience applauds) - Right, finally, we have Torsten Hoffmann, who's the producer of the Cryptopia Film. (audience applauds) - Thanks, Peter. Five years ago, I made a film about the history of money, banking, and Bitcoin. Buckle up, we said, it's gonna be a bumpy ride. And now, some of the big brains and big egos who championed cryptocurrency claim they're building a crypto-utopia. - Magical things will happen. - [Torsten] With something called blockchain technology, and it just might change your life. - And they really could compete with, if not take down the Facebooks and the Googles, and the Amazons. - My name is Torsten Hoffmann, and I'm going to put some of these claims to the test. Some critics say you kind of hurt the community. What's your response to that? This innovation has enabled lots of criminals and scammers. But basically looking at it now, you lied to us. Forget all the hype. We'll explore the true potential of this new invention. See who's already using it. - Making it really easy and simple for people to own a piece of a solar farm or wind farm. (soft music) - [Torsten] And go deep into a secret bunker that holds billions in Bitcoin. - [Christoph] We cannot talk too much about it because it's pretty secret what is down there, right. (soft music) - And if Bitcoin succeeds, it'll be at least $1 million per coin. (soft music) - [Torsten] We'll learn lessons from the past and meet those building the future. But there are those who want to kill it. - Join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency so that we nip this in the bud. - [Torsten] Control it. - Next year, people are going to start seeing that we have hundreds of patents and everything changes. - [Torsten] Or change the world with it. Welcome to ground zero in the battle for the future of the Internet: Web 3.0. - They wanted a science fiction dream, what they actually did was build forthcoming disaster. - A lot of people were not willing to learn and were not willing to admit they were wrong. - They're idiots. - Why is this fraud allowed to speak at this conference? - Stop telling me that I have no clue. - That's just bullshit. - If you don't support free speech, you don't support Bitcoin. You're an enemy of Bitcoin. - [Tim Draper] This is bigger than the internet, the Iron Age, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world. (electronic music) - For years and years, I've been researching blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, the market booms and busts, and many have asked me to explain Bitcoin to them, but I think this is why it's so difficult. - Cryptocurrencies, everything you don't understand about money combine with everything you don't understand about computers. - [Torsten] Okay, let's start slowly with the basics of money and it's creation. - [Narrator] The total value of all the world's money is about $120 trillion. What you probably didn't know is that each new dollar is created by governments and banks as debt, which needs to be paid back by someone in the future with interest. That's why there isn't enough money in the world to repay all that debt. And there never will be. Oh, and almost all of the world's money is already digital, just entries in the ledger, usually managed by a bank. Only a small portion exists as physical currency like cash or coins. Think of it this way, your employer deposits $1,000 into your bank account. Then you pay $200 in taxes, $500 for rent, $200 for bills and shopping and so forth. Whether you use credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, or bank transfers, they're all just pluses and minuses in different digital ledgers. That's why there's almost no need for physical money in our daily lives. - During the financial crisis in 2008, a mysterious figure called Satoshi Nakamoto published this nine page white paper. It said with Bitcoin's open source software, we can create our own money without banks or Governments. (electronic music) This new nerd money, called cryptocurrency, is created and stored in computers. And before long, there was a growing fan club, mostly guys like Roger Ver. Today, he's a polarizing figure, but back then, he gave away thousands of coins to kickstart the movement, and they all called him Bitcoin Jesus. - I think that for may years, he brought more people to Bitcoin than anyone else. And we will forever be grateful to him for doing that. - When I was a kid, I was reading all these science fiction books. They were talking about how the world is gonna be when we have this like anonymous digital cash that people can use on the internet that's not controllable by anybody. And then when Bitcoin came along, it was like: Wow, this science fiction money idea that I'd been reading about as a kid is finally here. So I got so excited about it. I heard about it at about 10 in the morning. And I was planning to go to work that day, but I didn't. I stayed home the entire day reading about it. Didn't leave, I stayed up all night that night reading about it. Stayed up all night the next night reading about it. - [Torsten] He went deep down that rabbit hole to the point of physical exhaustion. - So I called up a friend of mine, said please help me, I'm so sick. Can you bring me to the hospital? - [Torsten] Yeah, Roger got bit bad by the Bitcoin bug. - Cause it's truly one of the most exciting inventions ever in the entire history of human kind. - [Torsten] But how does it work? When my friends ask me to explain, well I often start with this analogy. - [Narrator] Imagine a bank vault where you have a safety deposit box. Your key opens one of the boxes where you can securely store physical valuables, like gold coins. In Bitcoin, there are digital keys. Think of them as very long passwords. Your private key gives you access to a wallet, which unlocks billions of unique Bitcoin addresses. Each one is a virtual safety deposit box that only you can open with your key. And there are more addresses in this virtual vault than atoms in the universe. The doors to these boxes are transparent. You can see inside them. Here's one with digital money, 0.21 Bitcoins. Sending them from one box to another is what's called a Bitcoin transaction. We'll explain that later. But for now, just remember that these digital coins can only exist inside these transparent address boxes, can't be copied, and can't ever leave the vault. And this vault is owned by no single entity. You don't need permission from a government, a bank, or a corporation to use it. (electronic music) - [Torsten] For most early adopters of Bitcoin, it was all about global peer to peer electronic cash. Room 77 in Berlin was one of the very first businesses to accept Bitcoins as payment for physical things, beers and burgers. - Back in 2011, there were no mobile wallets, right. So you had to go there, bring your laptop, type in this long address, risk losing the money if you didn't type it correctly. So the first guy who built a mobile wallet was some guy in Berlin who built it in order to buy his beer with his phone instead of his computer. - [Narrator] Credit cards are an old technology, and actually pretty complex. And you payment details are shared with many middlemen. Each of these parties are also taking a cut of the action, which is built into the price of nearly everything you buy. If you purchase something internationally, double the number of middlemen and triple the fees. Credit cards handle almost $20 trillion of transactions per year. (upbeat music) - [Torsten] Early Bitcoin adopters, like Room 77, avoided paying credit card fees. But Joerg's real beef was with the bankers who collect them. - [Torsten] Collapsing economies, murder, I didn't sign up for this. Let me get a drink. Well, actually, I need to buy my German crew some Gluwein and explain why they won't get paid until after Christmas. You see, transferring money from Australia, where I live, to Germany can take several days, and it will cost $30 plus exchange fees just for updating numbers in digital ledgers. After all, it's just moving data. I can send a picture or video to anyone on the planet almost instantly, for free. We live in the age of the Internet, but the banks won't send the data after 5:00 p.m., or on a weekend? That doesn't make any sense. So what if those slow and expensive middlemen with their multiple ledgers could be replaced with a giant database synchronised over the Internet? That's the big idea behind Bitcoin. And it's run by a decentralised global network of powerful mining computers and regular laptops. Here's how it works. When I pay my cameraman, what's really happening is that I use my key to open my wallet, and then instruct the network to send Bitcoins to his address. Most Bitcoin apps use QR codes to identify and address. You scan it, then swipe to use your key, and approve the transaction. - [Narrator] This information is shared throughout the global network within seconds. Every 10 minutes or so, one miner using a tremendous amount of energy beats all the others in a contest to solve a very difficult math problem. That miner is authorised to arrange the most recent transactions into a structured block, and is rewarded in Bitcoins for this work. All the data contained inside each block is represented by a check sum. The miner now adds the new block to the previous one. That's why it's called the blockchain. Now the ledger will be updated globally. The check sums of the previous block match the beginning of the new one, which are baked together forever. It's impossible to tanker with the data inside the block without changing the check sums and breaking the chain. (soft music) - [Torsten] This immutability is the first rule of Bitcoin. It means one one can ever change what was once recorded in the blockchain, or spend the same coin twice. That's also called censorship resistance, and it's critical to Bitcoin being used as real money. Awarded winning journalist Laura Shin tells me a story about women bloggers in Afghanistan being paid in Bitcoin. - One of the women had an abusive husband, and saved up here Bitcoins and eventually was able to divorce him because she was able to control her money when she earned the Bitcoins. - [Torsten] In my first film, the early adopters said that this kind of financial freedom for everyone was just around the corner. - The world's most populous network is adopting Bitcoin, that's the Internet. The world's largest economy is adopting Bitcoin. That's the internet. We have transcended borders. - It's totally failed as electronic cash. - [Torsten] David Gerard says it has unbanked the banked more than it has banked the unbanked. He's an outspoken critic of this technology. - It's not very good as a payment system. There a small payment in this case if you want to trade in things the Government doesn't want you to trade in. - [Torsten] That's David's polite way of saying illegal stuff. - In 2011, most of my partner colleagues were saying three things. It was either drugs, pornography, or arm sales. - [Torsten] The Silk Road was a black market on the dark web where the buyers and sellers used Bitcoins to fly under the radar of the authorities. It had one million users until the FBI showed up and shut it down. They caught this guy for running it, and confiscated the coins held in escrow by snatching his computer. And then they locked him away for life. Seems like a pretty straight forward case of law enforcement doing their job, but in crypto, not everybody sees it that way. - People have an absolute right to put whatever they want in their own bodies because their bodies belong to them. That makes Ross Ulbricht and the users of the Silk Road heroes, not criminal law breakers in a bad sense. They are criminal law breakers in a good sense the same way that Harriet Tubman or Rosa Parks, or you know, Thomas Jefferson, or George Washington were. - [Torsten] No doubt cryptocurrencies can be a tool for criminal activity. But so are dollar bills or the banking system. And let's not forget the blockchain is a public ledger. - It's actually been quite useful for uncovering crimes. A former federal prosecutor named Kathryn Haun, she was the one who discovered that there were a couple federal agents that were pilfering the Bitcoins that the Government had obtained from the Silk Road case for their own gain. And what was interesting was she got a tip that there might be one, one agent that was doing this. But from looking at the movements on the blockchain itself, she realised that there were two people. - [Torsten] The prosecutor could see those Bitcoins being moved. And when the dirty cops tried to sell them for dollars, they got busted. (soft music) But what makes Bitcoins worth stealing? Why do they have value at all? - [Narrator] Let's go back to where Bitcoins are stored in transparent digital deposit boxes, protected by strong cryptography. They can never be copied or leave the vault because any transaction of any Bitcoin, down to a 100 millionth fraction is recorded in the blockchain for eternity. This synchronised global ledger is shared among thousands of computers worldwide. That's why it can't be compromised or altered. Think about that. We can make an infinite number of perfect digital copies of a movie, a song, any file, but for the first time in history, this distributed record keeping allows us to have a truly unique and fungible digital object that is also scarce. If you could count all of these virtual coins, you'd find about 18 million of them today. The mining reward is the only way new coins are created. (soft music) In the first years of Bitcoin, miners competed for 50 Bitcoins every 10 minutes. Then their reward for processing transactions dropped to 25 Bitcoins, then 12.5, and then half again and again every four years. It's good old fashioned supply and demand. If investors or users of Bitcoin create a higher demand than this decreasing supply, the price will go up. When the cap of 21 million is reached, the protocol stops the network from creating any more. It's the opposite of our traditional money supply, which keeps growing and growing. (soft music) - Hmm, and unlimited amount of dollars versus a very limited supply of Bitcoins. You do the math! If you use Euros or dollars, you might not care about a little inflation per year. But if your currency isn't stable, you might be a trillionaire on paper, and be dead broke. (slow suspenseful music) - I grew up in Patagonia in the southern part of Argentina. My parents are sheep ranchers there. And I remember growing up in my childhood, I saw my parents loose everything three times. First because of a huge devaluation, then because of hyperinflation, and the last time because the Government confiscated all our bank deposits. I think that today, there are billions of people, at least four billion people who would be a lot better off by having access to a form of money that is non-political and more democratic. (soft music) (muffled speech) - We think of finance. We think of banking. We think of money. In terms of the experience and perspective of Western European or developed nation person, and that is really just a billion and a half people who have a very privileged financial life. What about the other six billion? Every single country that is free has essentially a legal status for cryptocurrencies that is very open and permissive. And every single country that is unfree has restrictive or banned cryptocurrency status. (soft music) - This is the Berlin Wall, still a powerful symbol of a Government trying to control its citizens. But this is what happens when people want to be free. The very first open crypto-war is playing out in Venezuela where the local currency loses value every hour due to hyperinflation. - A lot of people in Venezuela are trying to mine cryptocurrencies. And the government views this as a threat obviously because they're trying to keep the Bolivar propped up. The government actually provided electricity to a lot of people, and if they perceive that your electricity usage has gone up, they will come and check if you have mining equipment in your house, and they will confiscate it if they find it. - [Torsten] And that brings us to the big question, can Governments or banks ban Bitcoin? - So the title is ""Jamie Dimon"", ""Here's why you're wrong about Bitcoin"". - [Torsten] Dimon runs JP Morgan Chase, one of the largest banks in the world that moves $6 trillion every single day. - Oh, you said of Bitcoin eventually it will be closed. And then I said to anyone who knows anything about the technology, this is an incredibly absurd statement. I even said it was a little bit hilarious because I find it kind of funny the idea that you thought you could close Bitcoin. But you'd have to shut down the Internet, which also doesn't make sense. I could understand if you wanted Bitcoin shut down, or hoped it was a fraud. I mean if I were you, and if I really understood the disruption that crypto assets could bring to financial services, I'd be very scared. - And I think whatever Jamie Dimon says or thinks about Bitcoin is as relevant as whatever the Postmaster General thought or said about email: Who cares? - Then I wrote sincerely, Laura Shin. - [Torsten] But some politicians still think they can stop open source software. - I look for colleagues to join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans so that we nip this in the bud in part because an awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions clearing through the New York Fed is critical for major oil and other transactions. And it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us. - Cryptocurrency represents a litmus test for Governments. It reveals how much your Government believes in, in the fundamental freedoms and Human Rights because if they don't trust their own citizens to have control over their own money, that says a lot about the government and says very little about cryptocurrency. - [Torsten] You see, the reason why some Governments and most banks are threatened by this technology is simple, your private key and your wallet can replace your bank account. The network is run by software and its currency is made and maintained by computing power and electricity. It can't be manipulated by central bankers, Wall Street lobbyists or politicians. But with new freedom comes new responsibility. - Simple rule, if you control the keys, it's your Bitcoin. If you don't control the keys, it's not your Bitcoin. Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. - [Torsten] Got that? If you lose your key, you will never be able to access your coins again. And if someone hacks your computer where you store those passwords, your coins will be stolen in a second. And remember how Wences's family had their money stolen by their own government? Well, maybe that's why he built the Fort Knox of Bitcoin security, Xapo. - Most of our seven million customers are in emerging markets. In countries where there is problems with the currency, we have explosions in activity like Venezuela right now or Turkey. And we develop this system of vault where we have five private keys for each one of our Bitcoin addresses. We keep those private keys in an offline server that has never been online, will never be online. It's inside the vault. The vault is inside a bunker, usually deep underground. Our main one is in Switzerland in a decommissioned military bunker. - [Torsten] I just had to see it for myself even though it took months for us to get cleared for a tour. (soft music) We were met by Christoph Oschwald, a former military commander who runs the place, and a representative from Xapo. Christoph said the guards would rather shoot us than show us around. I hope he was kidding. - They need to bring in the material to the other side of the personal lock. - [Torsten] First up, one more check of our IDs, a pat down for weapons or any other monkey business, and gear inspection. Even the boss was searched. It took nearly an hour to get my team through security, but it was worth it. No other film crew has been allowed access. - We are the largest custodian of Bitcoin in the world because a lot of the largest holders in the world use us for security. - [Torsten] Rumour has it that 10% of all Bitcoins are stored here and in their four other secret locations. (soft music) - Unfortunately, I can't confirm any of those numbers. - From the mountain, we are getting a lot of benefits, right? Earthquake proof, flooding proof, but on the other side, you're facing a lot of additional costs. - [Torsten] Like maintaining seven independent backup power supplies. The labyrinth of tunnels deep into the mountain is interrupted by nuclear grade doors. (soft music) It's a level of security applied to all of the data Christoph protects here, not just for Xapo. - We cannot talk too much about it because it's pretty secret what is down there. - Are we allowed to film there? - No. - [Torsten] There were doors that remained shut and security measures we weren't allowed to see. - And some of those checks may be biometric including the eye and the finger print scan and the fingerprint scanner also makes sure that you are alive so that you didn't cut someone's finger and you're just using it to open the gate. - So you must have a pulse. (soft music) - Don't touch the racks. - [Torsten] These aren't Xapo's actual servers, but if you've ever wondered what cryptocurrency thieves dream about, it's sitting somewhere down here unplugged from the Internet. - There is absolutely no way, zero way to attack the data on the cold storage site. - [Torsten] But here's my question, why do I need the cold offline servers to be inside a mountain? Why can't it be in my basement? - While the server is in the basement, it still can be stolen, right? So this is like money. It is data, yes, it's bits and bytes, but it is money at the end, and a lot of money. This is why this data centre here is more a bank than a data centre. (soft music) - [Torsten] Okay, let's do a quick recap. We now have billions of dollars worth of data secured in digital banks deep inside secret military bunkers. If you don't think Bitcoin is already changing the world's concept of money, you haven't been paying attention. Remember Mervyn? He used to be a senior executive at Deutsche Bank. His colleagues once said Bitcoin was for law breakers and troublemakers. He now runs $100 million crypto fund out of Malta. - Our research shows that the crypto markets are gonna probably be worth about $8.7 trillion in 2027. - Which is 50x from today. - Exactly. - [Torsten] Most financial analysts say you better stick to your shares and bonds and dollars. Bitcoin is dangerous nonsense, far too risky as investment. To others, Bitcoin is an escape hatch that will take them away from risk, an insurance against financial doomsday, a way out of the debt crisis, negative interest rates, trade wars, and economic downturn. They say it's an anti-fragile asset uncorrelated to financial markets. So who's right here? Well, every time I turn on the television, it gets even more confusing. - Bitcoin is worth about a bit under $200 billion today. All the gold in the world is worth eight trillion, and it could become the next gold. - In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending. - But if Bitcoin is out there, and gold is out there, it can be a participant in bringing down the dollar. - I say it's the mother of all bubbles, and it's also the biggest bubble in human history. - Do you think this is a currency? A currency that's really gonna work eventually? - Well, I think it is working. And there will be other currencies like it that may be even better. - Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed. It doesn't serve any social useful function. - [Torsten] This film isn't investment advice, but it strikes me that most of these TV shows just want to stir controversy. They don't understand what's going on, but they know that filling airtime with a controversial topic will get them higher ratings. So how about the general public? In America, the younger generation already starts to trust this new asset class and Wences says Bitcoin may reach a million dollars per coin. - I would say the biggest financial mistake you can make right now is to own an amount of Bitcoin that you cannot afford to lose because it's super risky and you may lose it. The second biggest financial mistake you can make is not to own any. Because you put 1% of your net worth in Bitcoin. Most people can afford to lose 1% of their net worth. And if I am right, it's gonna be more than 100% of your net worth, so with a non-material exposure, you change your life. Now what you would spend on a romantic weekend with your wife, say sorry, we're not gonna do that this weekend. I'm gonna just buy Bitcoin. Consider it spent. It disappears, and check in seven years. I either give you bad advice, and cost you a weekend, or I want a grandkid called Wencito. (laughs) - But what you fail to mention is that the currency, the micro transaction. - All of that is irrelevant, right? Meaning all of the cryptocurrencies are way too volatile for anyone to take them seriously. - Hold on, let's go back to where we started. Bitcoin was created as peer to peer electronic cash. That was the killer app, a payment directly from you to me, from me to the coffee shop. - I have bought a bag of coffee for two Bitcoin in 2012, which today costs me $12,000 in today's money. That is a deflationary effect. As long as Bitcoin keeps doing sudden increases in prices, that's gonna stop retail use in it's tracks. - With Bitcoin, you can send $1 or $1 million worth of value anywhere in the world. You can do it for free. - [Torsten] But basically, looking at it now, you lied to us. Yeah, that's what they all used to tell me, cheap, easy, fast, global, unstoppable. I'm not done with you, pal. But I need to explain what happened here. Every block contains about one megabyte of data, much smaller than a photo you post on Instagram. That means only a limited number of transactions can fit into each block. If you want your payment to jump the line, you can choose to pay a premium fee or sit and wait. At one point, the blocks became so full that the transaction time went to several hundred hours. That's days! And it was more expensive than international wire services. It got so bad that a Bitcoin conference wouldn't take payment in Bitcoins! And he's the guy who promised me moving money fast and for free. What went wrong? - That's a direct intentional result of Bitcoin Core's policies of intentionally making it slow, expensive and unreliable. - [Torsten] And Roger blames this guy for Bitcoin not becoming a mainstream global currency. - There are no shortage of conspiracy theories. - Blockstream was founded in 2014. The original co-founders are a lot of core developers. - [Torsten] Those are the software coders who continue building Bitcoin after Satoshi vanished. Roger thinks those guys sabotaged the scaling of the network so Blockstream could promote its own software solutions. Sampson says come on, the blockchain is already 200 Gigabytes large and growing. - Every transaction made has to go out to the whole network. And every block that contains that transaction that is mined has also to go out to the whole network. And it has to be stored for eternity. - [Torsten] The argument, more independent miners will continue running Bitcoin and ensure decentralisation if the blockchain is kept small. In his view, this decentralisation is what makes Bitcoin valuable, a store of value! - So holding Bitcoin is also a use case. - And that store money hypothesis, I cannot get my head around. It's the most, like, nutty thing I've ever heard. - One philosophy could be described as Bitcoin as digital gold, and the other philosophy could be described as Bitcoin as digital cash. - [Torsten] The other team said you guys have it the wrong way around. First, Bitcoin needs to be usable as a currency, a medium of exchange. Then, maybe, it will become stable and a store of value. The solution is easy, just increase the size of the blocks from one to two, four, eight megabytes so that more transactions fit into them. This will lower the fees, and people will start using Bitcoin as cash again. - The original title of the Bitcoin white paper is Bitcoin, an electronic peer to peer electronic cash system. - [Torsten] But you know, Satoshi's white paper isn't the Bible. It's not a religion. Stuff changes, we evolve, we might find out new things. So why this fixation on that white paper created 10 years ago. - There isn't any fixation. It's not the version of Bitcoin that I got involved with, and it's not the version of Bitcoin that I want to support. - [Torsten] So Roger joined forces with a controversial online gambling billionaire, Bitmain, a Chinese crypto mining company and this guy. - I'll do whatever the fuck I want with my money. - [Torsten] Okay?! Anyway, they forced a software fork, which is a split into two separate blockchains. Every holder of Bitcoin now also owned the same amount of Bitcoin cash. - Roger had nothing to do with the creation of Bitcoin cash. Roger didn't know about it until a few weeks before it actually happened. - [Torsten] But still, Bitcoin Jesus had become Bitcoin Judas. - Every revolution is followed by the counter-revolution, which is usually a purge of the original revolutionaries. - People are very passionate about Bitcoin. And that's why they show a lot of emotion. - When you're part of a tribe, you get very religious about your tribe, making the other tribe almost your enemy. - It's very hard to debate Roger because a lot of what he's saying is just his opinions and his emotions. You cannot debate someone's emotions. - And then they basically diverted entire Bitcoin project into something that wasn't usable as peer to peer cash. - When he gave his talk, I kinda knew that that whole debate slash panel, I kind of expected it to go off the rails, but I didn't expect killing babies. - So that means more babies are dying in countries around the world because they have less economic freedom. More people are starving to death because they have less economic freedom. People are literally dying because of this. I'm not exaggerating. This is a life and death matter. - [Torsten] And remember that list of promises that early Bitcoiners championed? Cheap, easy, fast, unstoppable. I forgot one. - If you don't support free speech, you don't support Bitcoin. You're an enemy of Bitcoin. - [Torsten] Censorship shall not be abided. - In fact, I myself have tried posting just a direct quote from Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. - I think Roger complains a lot about censorship on Reddit, but Reddit is just one of many platforms. - Word for word quote from Satoshi, without any additional commentary from myself at all, and I've had that post deleted. - Even though I may not agree with a lot of things that Roger Ver is doing now, I do sympathise with him and his frustration with being censored. - They're literally censoring the words of the creator of Bitcoin. - Ultimately, it's just a forum that these guys set up to talk about Bitcoin, and they can do whatever they want with it, right? - [Torsten] When I first started covering this space, everyone was united in their struggle against the establishment. Now the industry has grown so much that they are competing parties, propaganda machines, conspiracy theories. Looks a lot like politics. - The biggest fight within the Bitcoin ecosystem is over at the moment is who has the right to the name Bitcoin? But at the end of the day, I think the version of Bitcoin described in the Bitcoin white paper has the strongest claim to the name Bitcoin than anything else. And that's Bitcoin Cash. - [Torsten] Roger owns Bitcoin.com and he has every intention of bringing Bitcoin Cash to the masses, even if it means that some people coming to his website think that they're buying Bitcoin but they're getting Bitcoin Cash. - I think it's fraudulent to say that in causing people to buy Bitcoin Cash when they actually want to buy Bitcoin. - [Torsten] So Bitcoin core fans say Roger is hijacking the brand name, and Bitcoin Cash supports claim that Blockstream is hijacking Bitcoin's development. - I mean yeah, it is a conflict of interest because they're developing this open source protocol in a way where their company can benefit from it. - Everything we're doing is open source, so it's not like there's some secrecy or anything. You can see all the code that's committed, and it does go through this vetting process. - They have had influence. I wouldn't say it's not true. But I don't think they have enough influence to actually corrupt Bitcoin. - We no longer have anyone maintaining the project just because we don't want that potential conflict of interest. - But in a way, now they've won the battle anyways. - [Torsten] So who won Bitcoin's first war? Well, both parties got their way. After the split, the market valued Bitcoins much higher. And Bitcoin Cash transaction fees were much lower. - The benefit of the scaling debate or civil war was Bitcoin was battle tested. Like a lot of companies and a lot of powerful people tried very hard to try to change Bitcoin, and they failed. - This thing that Satoshi Nakamoto launched is much more resilient than anyone even hoped. - I know, I know, you want to find out what any of this has to do with this new crytopia, a revolutionary internet. We'll get there, I promise. But first, we need to go from Bitcoins original blockchain to hundreds of blockchains. Back in 2011, when Charlie Lee was a Google engineer, he wanted a faster and lighter version of Satoshi's cryptocurrency, and was one of the first to experiment with the open source software. - The actual coding in terms of the code differences between Bitcoin and Litecoin was actually pretty trivial. - And what does that mean in time? - I would say like four, four or five hours. - Litecoin was positioned as silver to Bitcoin's gold. And it's network value grew to billions of dollars. Some critics say: Well, you sold at the highest point, and you kind of hurt the community. What's your response to that? - When I sold, no one knew it was at the highest point. I didn't know it was gonna be the highest point. Everyone thought it was gonna keep going up. In hindsight, it was good timing, selling it at that high. But I'm still focused full-time on Litecoin adoption, and working on Litecoin, Litecoin development. So it's not like I sold it and just quit. Nobody gets to kind of dictate how Bitcoin improves or grows. Whereas with Litecoin, I have a strong influence on the growth of Litecoin, which is good and bad. It's kinda like difference between the benevolent dictator versus a democracy. The benevolent dictator is more efficient, but you have to assume that the benevolent dictator stays benevolent. - Let's put a pin in that. Litecoin was one of the first alternative cryptocurrencies, or alt-coins. Some of the early adopters, like Charlie, made fortunes. Soon, there were hundreds of coins made by cryptographers, copycats, and con-men. There's a coin for bloggers, a currency for online gamers, one with anonymity, and even one for banks. But can this invention unleash something even more powerful than digital currencies? (dog barks) Back in 2014, I met the kid who knew how to do it. - Hi, I'm Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, founder of Ethereum, and just general Bitcoin and crypto currency advocate. - [Torsten] Just 19 years old, Vitalik was on a mission to make money programmable. - Vitalik is a very very smart guy. The thing about Vitalik is he was pushed away of Bitcoin because he had gone to to Bitcoin Core developers and tried to build Ethereum on top of Bitcoin. - [Torsten] And they basically said nope, not interested. So he built a separate blockchain called Ethereum, with its own currency called Ether. - A comparison might be Bitcoin is like a spreadsheet, and Ethereum is like a spreadsheet with macros. - [Torsten] Using our analogy, Ethereum allows you to store cryptocurrency and computer code in the same secure box. Here's how a smart contract might work. Let's say I bet Charlie that a Litecoin will be worth $200 on January 1st of next year. We each put an ether into a box along with a smart contract, a simple programme that automatically checks the price of Litecoins on that future date. If I'm right, the money goes to me. If I'm wrong, it's sent to Charlie. - A smart contract is neither smart nor a contract. It's a dumb program. And once you understand that all it is a dumb program, that clarifies a lot of stuff. And the word contract there is in the meaning of finance. - [Narrator] Most financial arrangements are pretty simple and clear cut. A bet with Charlie, your home loan, and insurance policy, just two parties and some form of exchange of value based on a set of rules called a contract. The same is true for global financial markets. Think bonds, futures, derivatives, credit default swaps. They're all just contracts, and the world economy runs on them using middlemen who all charge high fees. Proponents say that if we used smart contracts, we could tell the bankers, lawyers, escrow agents, and Wall Street finance guys to take a hike. - A soda machine is a smart contract machine, right. You stick in a dollar, you get a soda. It's very, very simple. The soda machine does take statistics, and it has to make sure that you can't scam it by stealing the soda, but Ethereum and the people that are trying to decentralise this will tell you that that transaction, that smart contract between you and the soda machine is so critical that it needs to be globally processed and saved at 100,000 decentralised computers because it is so sensitive. And in reality, 99% of all of these contracts, they don't need this kind of censorship resistance. - [Torsten] You know, in two years time when people will see this film, or in four years time, I think will be an interesting historic moment. - What we're doing is we're saying, we have this Ethereum network, inside the Ethereum network there's this asset called Ether, and we're actually going to be selling Ether. We're going to be selling Ether at a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 Ether for one Bitcoin. And that's how we're gonna raise all the money. - [Torsten] It worked. Vitalik figured out a way to fun the Ethereum project. And it made his investors very rich. This new model for fundraising soon had a name, and initial coin offering, or ICO. - IPOs and ICOs sound similar, but they have, they're nothing similar. The only thing similar about them is they both help you raise money. IPOs, you don't do until you have a company, until you have revenue, until you have users, until you can actually prove to the public investors that this is a valuable company that's worth investing in, and it's worth buying their stock. ICOs, it's pre-product. You have maybe a couple of people on the team. It's just a white paper. And so people are just buying into, trust into faith that this is something that will exist. - [Torsten] And this is the guy who opened the floodgates. He crated a standard called ERC-20, enabling you or me or anyone to create an ICO. - So on the one hand, you have these smart contracts, these little programmes that can talk to each other, but you have to define how do they talk to each other. And because everybody now agrees to that same standard. - [Torsten] Smart contracts can interact within the entire Ethereum network and the ERC-20 standard allow the creation of tokens. - The goal here is like, ultimately, I'd like to see eight year olds building their own financial systems. - [Torsten] Yeah, but what if some of these eight year olds are also scammers? - So let's say I'm trying to do a ICO, and I create a smart contract where I create a million coins, and one of the transactions is that if you send me $100, I will send you that many worth of coins. - [Torsten] It was a mad gold rush. - People realised wow, if, if I can just pull up, pull together a project and a white paper, I can raise money. - Like a lot of money. (soft music) Some people hawking new coins didn't actually exist. This handsome chap is the graphic designer of a Bulgarian ICO. Actually, they just posted a photo of Ryan Gosling. Another project raised millions in Ether, and then vanished, leaving investors with this website. Look closer, that's nice. Most of the scam coins were built on Vitalik's smart contract platform Ethereum using Fabian's token standard. This innovation has enabled a lot of criminals and scammers. - So I would say the amount of scams in that system are rather low. It sometimes looks bigger than it is. I would assume that the actual scams, purposeful scams, in that system maybe were like two or three percent. I would say actually most ICOs were not scams. - I would say about two to five percent of the thousands of ICOs that are happening are actually legit. - [Torsten] And the rest is? - Pretty scammy, or just not gonna work. - Can you define for me what a shitcoin is? (laughs) - I think it's just a derogatory term people use on coins that they don't like for Bitcoin maximalists, people who only care about Bitcoin, everything else is a shitcoin. In my point of view, I think a coin that is kind of a scam is a shitcoin. So people create coins just to get rich from it, print a lot of tokens out of thin air, trying to pump the price up and make a lot of money from it. And it's not really providing a lot of value to the world. - [Torsten] No value for the world, but they did add value for their creators. If you can print billions of tokens out of thin air like a central bank, well, that's why this guy was one of the wealthiest men on earth for a brief moment. Here's how that happened. - [Narrator] There will only every be 21 million Bitcoins, and it's inventor had to earn them by mining with his computers just like everyone else. There are more Litecoins, and even more Ether in circulation. Vitalik kept some portion to fund the development team. And then there's Ripple. They created 100 billion XRP but kept 80% for themselves and their clients. And the other 20%, they gave as a bonus to the founders. That's how you get to be one of the richest men on earth. - [Torsten] Okay, maybe I was a bit too harsh on ICOs democratising start up finance can be a good thing. There were many legit companies raising capital too. Over the years, I've met many founders who have real offices with real people trying to solve real problems. But to Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is the be all end all of cryptocurrency. Other blockchains, ICOs, smart contracts, that's all a waste of time. - There is no such thing as blockchains, that revolutionise the healthcare industry, and the automotive production... - Of course there is. - Huh? - Of course there is. What you're saying is a maximalist point of view. You are speaking about from a perspective of, of a cult or a sect. My problem is that you are hijacking a movement of a technology that is far greater and has far more potential than just these individuals. - There's all of these different things that you could use blockchain for, right. And so people have, they're almost like different ecosystems. And then what you see is almost like an evolutionary process right, where the blockchains fork and they have the same ancestries, but they adapt to different environments and we see this like every increasing level of diversity in number of blockchains. So I think the idea that here's like one blockchain, gonna be one blockchain and it's gonna be fit for everything, it's almost like disregarding the nature of evolution. - Meanwhile, the big corporations have been studying cryptocurrency. And they think that Bitcoin's underlying database is where the magic is. The motto in the boardrooms, Blockchain, not Bitcoin! Back in Germany, my friend Oliver keeps tabs on the men in suits. He used to be one of them. - [Torsten] BMW is looking at using the blockchain for their future fleet of electric cars to interact with public transport. Lufthansa wants to see if the blockchain can better track parts and maintenance. And Deutsche Telekom is using smart contracts to negotiate tariffs for roaming costs with other telecoms. (soft music) if we can store trade certificates and shipping documents on the blockchain, you can check to see where those organic avocados really came from, who grew them, who packed them, and who shipped them. Besides, the Internet of things needs a ledger of all those things. Well, that's the idea behind private centralised blockchains, maintained and controlled by corporations. A famous example, the Walmart supply chain trial, which they're working with IBM. That's a completely centralised. They use a blockchain derived product Hyperledger, but all the nodes reside on the IBM cloud, and they're all administered by Walmart, and the supplier is used because Walmart told them to. It's a centralised database system! But they marketed it Blockchain. So that means one, they wouldn't have got a New York Times headline if they just said database. - [Torsten] You might wonder what's the point of a blockchain if it's controlled by a company? Well, I compare it to the open Internet versus company owned Intranets. They both exist. Meanwhile, Facebook announced a cryptocurrency for their two billion users. Such a system might be more efficient than a public blockchain, but there's a downside. Some Governments banned it within weeks. - Right now, the ways, pieces of paper, that's being shifted around, that doesn't make any sense. That infrastructure needs to be replaced. - [Torsten] Why occupy Wall Street when we can build a new one on the blockchain instead? In the future of decentralised finance, stock certificate, corporate bonds, insurance policies, property deeds, mortgages, all can be turned into crypto tokens and made tradable 24/7. (electronic music) - What's much more exciting than tokenized securities of traditional businesses where it's just equity that you pass around is totally novel digital securities that you couldn't do before, right. Novel use cases where you could kick back cash flow on a continual basis. I think some examples of this that we're seeing now are MakerDao, Binance which has Binance Coin, that's actually much bigger of an opportunity because it represents something totally new. (soft music) - My name is Dr. Jemma Green, and I'm a co-founder and the chairman of PowerLedger. And we use the blockchain to enable electricity trading, energy asset financing, and carbon markets. - [Torsten] This award winning Australian company wants to take us to a carbon-free economy faster. Jemma has identified a problem. - Apartment buildings, often the buildings are tenanted. And it means that if there is solar panels, the owner of the apartment isn't really incentivize to put in solar panels or batteries because the tenant benefits. But using our platform, the tenant will pay their electricity bill to the body corporate. - [Torsten] Using PowerLedger, the tenant pays the owner, not the power company for their electricity. And if the tenant isn't at home, the unused energy will be sold to a neighbour, lowering their power bill and making a profit for the owner. - So it actually crates the mechanism to justify investing the capital in the first place. - This system could speed up investment in sustainable energy projects by making it easy to own a piece of a solar or wind farm. (soft music) Why do I need a blockchain for this? Can't I invest in a solar farm without this new fancy tech? - The blockchain acts as a kind of asset register and income register, and in tokenizing the asset, it becomes tradable on an exchange. You might own two or three solar panels of a thousand, you know, in a solar farm, and you would receive the income associated with that amount of ownership. - Now bankers don't very much like being cut out of the cashflow loop, so they took another look at Mr. Nakamoto's curious little white paper. And they've recently been spending a billion dollars a year in blockchain research. Isn't it ironic, Satoshi's anti-bank invention is now being used by the banks to move money faster. And by big business to track supply chains. Cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, public blockchains, private blockchains, where is the killer app? Well, adoption of new technology often follows old trends. - My name is Marc Ventresca. I'm here at Oxford, the University of Oxford on the faculty. I'm an economics sociologist by training, interested in how large-scale infrastructure changes. - So great so see you after nine years. - [Marc] I know. - [Torsten] Marc teaches a class on innovation and system building. He tells me what must align for a new technology to become fruitful. - All technologies start out as interesting ideas. Some of them begin to develop into innovations and we know that arc from invention to innovation takes a lot of time, takes a lot of work. Some of those innovations eventually become commercially viable. - [Torsten] Case in point, the automobile. In the early days, cars looked like a pretty lousy idea, and poorly executed. - Early on, there were electric cars, there were battery operated cars. The combustion engine was a relative late comer. - [Torsten] It took Henry Ford's mass production to create the standards, what a car looked like, what parts it needed, how it operated. That's when complementary assets and infrastructure emerged. - So you have a paved roads and petrol stations. Then you have secondary things like motels and restaurants, and places to eat while you're on the highway and buy food. Then you have interesting questions like what side of the road should we drive on. - [Torsten] An entire ecosystem had been built, but it wasn't a smooth transition by any means. - The imagery here is there are maybe a couple of hundred, three or four hundred companies that tried to get into this space. But they're not car companies. They're bicycle manufacturers or steam engine manufacturers. At some point, in this account, all that period of ferment settles around a dominant design, and then you have what, again, what innovation economist would call a shakeout. They would say you go from 300 or 400 producers, all of them vying to shape this emerging space, this emerging thing called the automobile. You may then drop to 20 or 30 manufacturers. And then you may drop to five or six. - [Torsten] It took 50 years for cars to go from curious invention to finally tuned, mass market product. 50 years to change the world as we knew it. ‚ô™ Bitcoin is Gold theme song ‚ô™ - [GPS] Your destination is on the left. - [Torsten] But our story isn't about cars or roads. I want to learn about dominate designs of digital technology. That's why I came to the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley. - So you're looking at the console for SAGE, which was probably the first computer network. There were 23 centres around North America to warn against Soviet bombers. And they were waiting for World War III. - [Torsten] The US military and some American universities asked this guy to create a new kind of network to connect their separate networks. - And this young girl got up and she had a bunch of questions, but her first one was how did I manage to convince all the governments of the world to let us build the Internet. And I said well, except for the handful of us that were actually working on the Internet, nobody else really thought it was a very good idea, and they didn't think it was gonna lead anywhere. And you know, we pretty much had free running room. - [Torsten] Yes, that's the man who co-invented TCP/IP about 50 years ago. That's their original academic paper. You can think of TCP as the backbone of the Internet. But back then, there were many competing technologies. - There was a very big battle over the protocols. TCP/IP didn't just win by default. It won through attrition by basically being better, simpler, easier to deploy than all of the other proposals. - And more scalable. And it had a lot of competition from phone companies that tried to make the Internet a closed, metered, controlled system. They tried to do what people are trying to do today with blockchains, which is take the open decentralised network and turn it into this sterile, closed corporate system where they can charge by the minute and be in control. - [Torsten] The Internet's ultimate victory has a dirty little secret. The men in charge of promoting it were employees of the military with the muscle and the cash to beat the competition. - And then there's email. - Email? I heard that's really neat. - [Torsten] Email was perhaps the Internet's first killer app. Then in the early 90s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web as a 20 page proposal. Soon, there were browsers that made it more accessible and user-friendly for the general public. (electronic music) - I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of Government. The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash. - [Torsten] Still, few understood the potential of this new tech. - From people who thought it would just be the world's greatest library, to some of the early cypherpunks, who are the direct forefathers of crypto, and certainly blockchain-type ideas, who thought much as today, that it would create kind of a Commons that was outside of the direct control and normal laws of Governments. - [Torsten] That's ironic because the US Government funded it in the first place. The spiritual forefathers of crypto who built the early Internet thought it was a new technology for global freedom of expression and a blank canvas upon which they could build their dreams. Boy, that sounds familiar! And the media? They didn't quite know what to make of this new thing either. But sure enough, they found juicy stories about the dark side of it. - Which was the Internet is full of criminals, and paedophiles, and pornographers. And it's too dangerous to use your credit card on it. It's full of scams. We're seeing the exact same story now. - We envision technology as if it were autonomous, as if it were simply outside of human and social experience. But we see our technologies that become shaped by commercial interests, by political an regulatory infrastructure, by actors who are acting for many reasons, right? - Where do you want me? - [Torsten] Remember Bob? The big telecoms wanted his thoughts on a little idea they were kicking around. - They had a meeting where they trying to figure out how they could buy the Internet. If they couldn't kill it, well why not own it? - I got asked that myself by an executive at a large information company. It was probably in 1990 if they could buy the Internet. (scoffs) - I remember asking them well, why don't you buy the world economy, then you can own everything. Why don't you buy the weather, then you can control that too. - [Torsten] As the Internet's momentum and hype grew, investors threw money at entrepreneurs and shady characters. (soft music) - The joke in the Dotcom era was that you put a dotcom behind your company even if it had nothing to do with the Internet. And the venture capitalist just throw money at you. - [Torsten] It took a few decades and hype cycles, but the wild Internet was eventually domesticated, co-opted by trillion dollar companies and then fundamentally transformed how we shop, work, and communicate. (soft music) Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park. For 150 years, this has been a safe place to stand on a soapbox to sell your ideas, preach the Gospel, badmouth the king, or promote communism. Today, with the World Wide Web, we can stand on giant, digital soapboxes using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. We can share our ideas, or start a fight, with anyone on the planet. - Well, almost anyone. Of 65 countries studied, China has the least free Internet, worse than Iran, Cuba or Syria. A police force of more than two million cybercops and the world's most sophisticated Artificial Intelligence system keep China's web content clean and users in check. So sorry to break it to you, but there's no longer a World Wide Web. Welcome to the Splinternet. No, it's not just in China. - [Narrator] In Russia, Wikipedia is illegal. Facebook is outlawed in Bangladesh. There's no WhatsApp in Dubai. Twitter was banned in Turkey after news about Government corruption spread. And Saudi Arabia shut down the region's largest news services, Al Jazeera and the BBC. Meanwhile, in India, the entire web was turned off 100 times last year. - [Torsten] To be fair, some of the censorship is to prevent terrorist recruitment, or to stop violent mobs from hurting people. But I think Government's control over the Internet has gone just a little too far... - Hello, I'm from the Australian Government. Do you have something to hide? We've taken the UK's fascist spying law and made it even more fascist. To test this shit fuckery, we chose Australia, the weakest of the Five Eyes alliance, thanks to our lack of a Bill of Rights. So international data requests will now be funnelled through us, compromising not just Aussies, but all of you fuckers too. You're welcome! (soft music) - Hold on, Satoshi turned money into code, code is just letters and numbers, which is speech, right? So money, now is speech, which is a pretty powerful idea if you think about it. But if Bitcoin is this uncontrollable, uncensorable technology. Can the blockchain also enable global free speech? - [Narrator] In some places, it already does. One Chinese student tried to report a sexual assault, and was silenced by her college. But she knew that she can attach a message into the metadata of an Ethereum transaction. So she spent 15 cents and now her letter outlining her story and the threats she received is on the public Ethereum blockchain where it will remain unchangeable forever. (soft music) - [Torsten] The early cryptopioneers wanted to democratised money. Finance 2.0, if you will. But now, the believers in the blockchains have their eyes on a bigger prize: They want to decentralise everything. Web 3.0. Facebook without the propaganda. Twitter without the terms of service. Reddit without the censorship. Online identity without the hacks. Internet browsing without tracking software. Websites without the advertising. - We pay with either attention or privacy. So we either have advertising thrown at us, our attention is monetized, or we pay with micro violations of our privacy. - [Torsten] And that is why the internet today is the ultimate surveillance economy. One privacy tool is the Brave browser. It doesn't store data and pays users and content publishers in their basic attention tokens. (electronic music) - What most people in the crypto space are probably most excited about is this notion that we can create these kinds of user-owned decentralised networks. You can, for instance, offer file storage in the way that an Amazon does, or that you could offer search, you know, the way Google does, but do it in a peer-to-peer fashion without this behemoth at the centre extracting rents. And do it in a way where all the people that are users of it can benefit. - Blockstack is the next evolution in computing. We've seen three main eras of computing before. We had mainframes that were these large computers that everyone depended on. Then we got desktops where users were in control, and they owned their own computers, and their data and information. And then we saw cloud computing where we're dependent on these large companies running services for us. And we're about to embark on this major shift in computing called decentralised computing where users are getting back in control. (soft music) - And they really could some day compete with, if not take down some of the big tech giants, like the Facebooks and the Googles and the Amazons that we know. - [Torsten] That's a tall, tall order. - It is, it is, but I mean who would've thought at the beginning of the Internet that Wikipedia would beat out Encarta. - [Torsten] These Web3 promises sound good, but my professional network is on Linkedln. My personal photos are on Instagram. If I deleted my accounts, I'd lose everything! These services aren't just walled gardens, they are digital prisons. - Data is locked up in several companies. And we don't own it. The companies own it. But they use the data to mine it, to advertise to us, to sell us things, to manipulate us, to change our behaviour, and Ocean Protocol is the answer to freeing up the data and giving the power back to individuals. - [Torsten] So how do you plan to do that? - It's essentially an operating system on top of Ethereum that allows for people to share data, storage, algorithms, and computation in a way that preserves privacy. - [Torsten] It's too early to tell whether projects like these can succeed. But I do like the ideal of digital property rights. Wouldn't it be nice if companies paid us in cryptocurrency when they use our data? And if we control who has access to it instead of our digital overlords. And then there is the question of our most precious information, our very identity. - If you take the history of mankind, a lot of blood has been shed getting to democracy, right? The idea that every man has a vote in the world. And you know, I take it kind of personally because I was born in South Africa during apartheid, you know, a child of Indian immigrants. And we were not allowed to vote. - [Torsten] Vinny tells me that in the United States alone there are 14,000 different paper forms of birth certificates issued by local authorities. There are mistakes on them and even identity theft starting from birth. - All your information is already out there. There's five hacks a day happening, so how do you prove that you are who you say you are? (soft music) - [Torsten] Our crypto celebrity Andreas has 10 imposters on Instagram. Ryan Gosling's alter ego is committing financial fraud in Bulgaria. And who knows what's happening with your compromised information? Blockchain-based services like Civic's identity.com, or Microsoft's lon say they can give us control of our identity and protect it. - Currently, we are having our reputation, our history with different systems and different companies, like Facebook and Twitter. With the blockchain, the core of important information sits on that trusted system which we control, and we can take from wherever we want to go to something else. - [Torsten] Meanwhile, Vitalik has inspired thousands of software developers to build his vision of decentralized finance, but early in Ethereum's history, something went wrong with one of the first smart contracts called the DAO. - The DAO went like this, they wanted a completely ""the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation"". They wanted a science fiction dream of an independent computer program that was immune to human influence. So what they actually did was build a forthcoming disaster. - [Torsten] The problem? Some sloppy code left their safety deposit box wide open, and somebody just helped themselves. - It allowed them to pilfer $50 million from this smart contract. And that's why when I say it's not even clear whether or not it was a hack, this smart contract allowed them to do that. What happened was the majority of the community did decide to roll back the blockchain and to pretend like the DAO never happened. - [Torsten] Yep, you heard that correctly. The top decision makers forked Ethereum into two separate networks, one where the money was gone, and a new one where the money was restored to it's original owners breaking the first rule of cryptocurrency, never alter the blockchain. - Immutability last only as long as the big boys haven't lost money. - [Torsten] Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum also experienced scaling problems. When a decentralised app called Crypto Kitties, I'm not kidding, went viral, and the kitties bred like rabbits in it's blockchain, the system ground to a halt. The network is now being upgraded. But there are many competitors who claim that their blockchains are faster, fairer, and more scalable. The next shakeout will sure be interesting to watch. - It's never easy to admit that, that you've been fooled. Maybe I've been fooled. Maybe? - [Torsten] The crypto community doesn't agree on much of anything, except when it comes to this guy. - Hello, my name is Dr. Craig Wright. I'm the chief scientist of nChain Limited. - On the balance of the evidence, Craig Wright almost certainly is not Satoshi Nakamoto. - The proofs that he gave were not real proofs. In the end, he either chickened out or didn't actually have the proof. - Craig Wright obviously seems to be a scammer. - I'm happy to say that Craig Wright is a fraud. - I know he's controversial. No one really changes the world without being bold, without disrupting peoples' ideas, an without drawing a little controversy around the way. - [Torsten] But the majority of industry says Craig is crazy or a conman. - So Craig, kindly join us on stage. - [Torsten] And that giving him screen time is irresponsible. - And I'll say this quite frankly because I've got more money than your country. - [Torsten] But I was in the area and just couldn't resist. (doorbell rings) (soft music) A few quick facts, Craig is the person who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto on the BBC. But his cryptographic proof didn't check out, and since then, many just see him as an imposter. - I'm the guy with a law degree that used to work for federal police and military intelligence. - You would actually be the perfect supervillain for us because everybody kind of doesn't believe you, hates you. What do you say to your critics? - Do I start with a muahuahua? Many people are hated early on because they're not understood. If it doesn't have a use, it shouldn't have a value. Right now, practically everything is a Ponzi. I don't particularly like Ethereum. It's a dead end. They can say whatever they want about ERC-20 except practically everything they're doing that they want to solve, I solved years ago. Decentralisation was never the point of Bitcoin, ever. I was called a fool then, and I'll be called a fool again. And every single time I'll be right. I picked up ""Mastering Bitcoin"" the other day, and I opened page one. And I went this is wrong. Silkroad was the worst thing to ever happen to Bitcoin. - You seem to think that nobody else has anything interesting to say. You've already solved the problems many years ago. That's kind of the vibe that I'm getting here. - Fairly much, yes. - [Torsten] Okay. Turns out, Craig's playbook is patents. Some say he's a patent troll. - Well, I've got a bucket list bit which is to beat Edison, which as silly as it sounds came from a Simpsons episode. To beat Mr. Edison, I need to get 1,085 (patents). And right at the moment, I'm on white paper 1,074. - [Torsten] For each white paper, he claims to file about 1.1 patents. - The first 163 will be very shortly public. Next year, people are gonna start seeing that we have hundreds of patents, and everything changes. We file PCT and keep them secret as long as we can. - There's a huge philosophical disagreement between myself and Craig. So I think patents are Government granted monopoly. - [Torsten] The big brains and big egos who broke away from Bitcoin couldn't hash out their differences. So there was another split. Craig's new coin also claims to be the 'real' Bitcoin. And he wants to enable blocks a million times larger, updating and storing this giant blockchain will be impossible for normal computers. I just can't figure this guy out. Is he a genius, a madman, a fraud? Maybe all three? - And a lot of the things he says are very, are just wrong technically. - However, I did calculate that nChain spent tens of millions of dollars to develop and file these patents. And some have been granted. What's the point of having a war chest full of IP if they aren't going to enforce it? So basically what I'm looking at is stuff that nobody's ever really seen in the community. - [Craig] That's correct. Yes. - As soon as the price of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies went higher, what did most people do? All they did was start adopting all the worst behaviours of bankers, scamming the market, centralising wealth in a few hands. - [Torsten] Hmm, I think that's called human nature. - So everyone wants to change the world simply because they're not in the position of power. As soon as they get into that position, they do exactly the same thing. - [Torsten] So guys like you will build a better future and we can trust you guys better than the bankers? - You don't have to trust us. That's the beauty. We're building a trustless, decentralised system that gives power to people. (soft music) - Trustless sounds like there's no trust. But actually it means we don't need to trust you. I think the better word should be trust-free.. About one third, or maybe half of all the cost of all the transactions are paid to establish trust between trading parties. Like we're paying for lawyers. We're paying auditors. We're paying even police, even regulators, Government to build trust, to ensure everything will be enforced. So trust is quite expensive. Blockchain is the first time that we saw some technology that can eliminate the cost or reduce the cost of trust dramatically. Magical things will happen. - [Torsten] Trust may be expensive, but it's also in short supply. All around the globe, people have been losing faith in the media, institutions, and Governments. So what if this new technology could fix one of society's biggest issues? But the question remains: What if you are cheated? What if your password is stolen, and the money, the contracts, your identity is gone? If code is law, who administers justice? Aren't you worried that the promise of decentralizing power is kind of in jeopardy with you and Charlie and Vitalik and Craig as such central figureheads? - Yeah, I really wish there weren't public figures or leaders. I want everyone to lead themselves, but sadly that's not the world we live in. If you're gonna look to a leader, you know, choose your leader wisely. - But just how different are they from our current political, financial, and business leaders? Are their systems really resistant to corruption, immune to manipulation, and worthy of our trust? Maybe that's why the best bet is on the only project without a figurehead: Bitcoin doesn't care about human drama, bad press, or what anyone thinks. Yeah, sure, it hasn't succeeded as a global currency yet, but in the past decade, it has been the world's best performing financial asset. So we're back to where we started: The genius who vanished. - With Satoshi being gone from Bitcoin, Bitcoin is really a very decentralised network and currency. - He was intelligent enough to know that a system without a father was gonna be much more robust than a system with a father. - No father maybe, but without leaving a will, the kids are now fighting over the meaning of his invention, and the inheritance, projecting their fears and fantasies onto his legacy. (soft music) For some, it's money for the Internet that can replace middlemen and bank the unbanked. And maybe a tool for illicit trade, or is it digital gold? A totally new asset class. A bet against the bankers. And insurance against inflation. Protection from corrupt politicians. And a weapon against the state. Maybe the end of money as we know it. For some entrepreneurs, it represents a shortcut to fund their dreams. A platform for fairer finance. Which is why incumbents fight it. Some say public blockchains are just slow and useless databases. While big business is busy building private blockchains to boost efficiency. Or maybe this decentralised technology is a new protocol layer for the Internet upon which we can build a better web to dethrone the tech giants, reclaim free speech, protect online identities, and facilitate free trade in a borderless, digital economy. Oh, and a tool to rebuild trust in our societies, and yes, maybe even save the planet. That's a never ending list of cryptopian ideas. (soft music) Isn't this a bit too much to ask of a nine page document? (soft music) Yeah sure, the Internet and the Web started out as white papers too. But it took decades before it's infrastructure was built, became user friendly, and ready to scale globally. - We kind of domesticate the wild potential of technologies into what's familiar. And we dramatically underestimate, or under imagine what that technology may eventually do. - [Torsten] It'll be the users, maybe billions of them, who will adopt this technology without even knowing what a blockchain is or how it works. Because here's the thing: The average users don't care about the wires that move their money quicker, don't know about the software that moves this movie or that picture, what will move them are services that'll make their days a little brighter, their chores a little lighter, and their lives a little richer. ‚ô™ Dude's got suits ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Dude's got a tie and a big smile ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And he's pitching me some blockchain ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Supply chains are broken ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Do we need his token ‚ô™ ‚ô™ There's a pain in my brain ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And I'm going insane ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I don't want no blockchain ‚ô™ ‚ô™ That one plays chess at his desk ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Poses for the press ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The price of his coin just tripled ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I just stare into the Ether, take a breather ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Cause I don't wanna cause a Ripple ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Don't wanna cause a Ripple ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I won't trust him with my money ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Will never trust him with my life ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Well I have been told ‚ô™ ‚ô™ That my life is controlled ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But Bitcoin ain't Gold ‚ô™ (rock music) ‚ô™ That guy speaks code ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Runs a full node ‚ô™ ‚ô™ This is new money production ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Talks Bretton Woods ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Of illicit goods ‚ô™ ‚ô™ This is a weapon of math destruction ‚ô™ ‚ô™ This is a weapon of math destruction ‚ô™ ‚ô™ That lady's quick on her feet ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Lit in her a tweets ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Says she takes on the haters ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And nothing can break her ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The Web could be much safer ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And our Freedom quite greater ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And it's all in this white paper ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All in this white paper ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I don't trust them ‚ô™ ‚ô™ With my money ‚ô™",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfqPj7PpVc,"['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'XRP', 'Litecoin', 'Flow', 'Core', 'Safe', 'JUST', 'Tribe', 'Solar', 'Secret', 'Status', 'Symbol', 'WHY', 'insurance', 'Save', 'ARC', 'MAD', 'MATH', 'SIX', 'PAID']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lSfqPj7PpVc/hqdefault.jpg,2023-07-04T19:13:49Z

#crypto","yes those meme coins get stranger and stranger names we had fcoin we had coino now tits are up yes have a look at this chart the wheel of tits token went up by 44% in the last 24 hours which is mainly due to a buyer overhang of 71% the buying volume versus selling volume is 52 versus 48% it's mainly a lot of small buyers on chain that are getting into the token now in this video we want to look at more onchain data we want to figure out how much longer this really can last and at what point in time it might make sense to take profit now the long-term chart of tits looks pretty smooth right it looks like it was smooth sailing some kind of dorcy at the beginning and now we are taking off but this is actually not what happened once we see the logarithmic chart we see an absolute roller coaster ride from top to bottom tits went down by 92% temporarily and so are we going to see another 92% crash or will this really last for a bit longer let's have a look I say it time and time again but probably I don't have to say it here the website of course does not provide any valuable information to figure out where the highs and lows of this token might be it's an interesting distraction but that's about it let's compare social metrics so over here we've got 5,000 Twitter followers roughly in telegram we've got 3,000 300 members and on chain we've got 14,000 holders of tits now let's get into the details right let's have a look at what the adoption metrics actually are on the left side we see the number of new users versus recurring users on the right side we see the number of token transactions per day and yes we do see how the number of first-time Traders tends to somewhat rise but the number of recurring Traders also is pretty high this is not necessarily that great because what we want to see is something like here at the beginning right you want to see an overhang of first-time Traders we want to see a growing investor base now here's what's impressive on a logarithmic scale we had our nice pump and dump already now we are pumping way further on a linear scale we see how different the magnitude here was this is the trading volume in the early days this is the trading volume today and with that second wave we now see that the larger wallets tend to get into the token as well now large wallets is everything between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of the token most trading volume now happens with wallets between $1,000 and $10,000 worth and so the whales they pocketed a lot of the tokens already early on and they kept on holding the small retail investors they are now jumping in much more so this time we do the thresholds not based on US dollars but based on the number of tokens so on the left side it's a minimum holding of 3,000 tokens in order to be counted in this chart so that's what I consider a small retail that's roughly $11,000 worth of the token for the chart in the middle it's another 10x so that's a minimum holding of $110,000 and on the right side another 10x so $100,000 worth of the token at current prices again so small retail didn't buy that much at the the beginning but the big whales they did buy the real explosion of small retail accounts happened just recently and yes there are still whales that are buying in the number of Wales is going up but the whales are smart right they buy when the token is just a few cents they buy less when the token is way larger and so there's a real shift in ownership happening the percent of tokens that are held by the people that have at least $10,000 worth of the token continues to grow very quickly so at least 10,000 is large retail Wales is at least 100,000 95% of tokens are now held by those large wallets this is not how it used to be the big whale wallets now hold more than 200 million worth of the token while the small retail investors that have less than $1,000 worth of the token only hold 1.8 million worth and so the Wales are pushing up tits the Wales are pushing up that price and that's of course because the crypto Market as a whole is expanding so this is the stable coin market cap over time and when this tends to go up then crypto prices also tend to increase and when it tends to go down then crypto prices tend to do not that well what we see over here this turn around this was the collapse of Tera Luna of the anchor protocol this is when us dep packed during this downtrend we also had the collapse of FTX and then we saw the turn around in October of 2023 so this is when I closed all of my short positions I was shorting a lot of alt coins around this time I was betting on falling prices and since October of last year I am buying a lot now the the big question is always how can we get those kinds of tokens when they are still cheap for example how can we buy something like Z bro before it doubles within a week because I made a video on seral bro and nobody watched it right it underperformed your average video so the average video is in Gray and that the REO video is in blue but at the time the price was at 7 cents and now it's at 45 cents and so that's the dilemma with YouTube right when you make a video about a token with a lot of upside potential that's not yet that well known then nobody will watch it and the YouTube algorithm won't spread the video If a token however has already a large investor base and the upside potential might not be that high anymore that's then the time when YouTube shows it to everyone so if you don't want to miss the next video on a small token feel free to subscribe over here and especially hit the notifications because again the YouTube algorithm probably won't show you the small videos now here is how I found out about Z real bro at 7 cents I Got a notification in our wallet tracking Kyle Chessie bought the token for 7 cents and again since then we went up by roughly 500% and so here is Kyle chesse he's got 136,000 subscribers and through onchain analytics we found 12 of his wallets and so I believe this is an approach that in general works pretty well it's trying to find wallets of other influencers it's trying to find wallets of insiders it's trying to find wallets of top traders that tended to make good trades in the past and then just em them right get signals whenever they buy and sell and then take that as inspiration here have a look at this channel this is Crypt bter they've got more than 1 million subscribers when they talk about a token of course this generates a lot of attention and that attention at least partially transfers into purchases we have got 33 of Crypt bent's wallets now check this out this is Alex Becker 1.5 million subscribers and we've got 12 of his wallets and so I really like this approach I like it much more than just picking a random token in list I think it's better to look at the people that already make money and then emulate their performance that's why I made a dedicated tutorial section just on this topic so how can we find various influencer wallets how can we then get alerts for those wallets and how can we finally also interpret the alerts that we get from the wallet tracking it's all part of the premium membership of this channel that's down below the Bitcoin trade.com is not just about wallet tracking right it's also about onchain analytics so the charts that we looked at today it's also about risk mitigation it's about portfolio speci ification it's about indicator back testing there's all kinds of topics it's more than 100 tutorial videos in total so once we've got a wallet signal we of course also have to discuss when should we buy when should we sell we have to compare our onch analytics that's why we've got dedicated Chats on the individual all coins as well so feel free to check it out it's currently $125 per month there's also a onewe money back guarantee so in case you don't like premium in case you don't make money in case you don't learn anything just message me within the first 7 days and I'll refund you 100% there's really zero risk for for you so could tits go higher yes it could definitely go higher but it probably won't go beyond 3x from here because there is somewhat of a limit at roughly 1 billion market cap very few pump. fun ecosystem tokens go beyond that if you got some value on this video feel free to subscribe I youly a like would be very much appreciated as well it helps the channel grow see you in the next video or see you in premium cheers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAljNqcr800,"['Bitcoin', 'JUST',
