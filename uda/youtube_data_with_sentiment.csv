Why is Market Cap IMPORTANT In Crypto? (BEST Explanation in 3 minutes),"In general, market cap refers to market capitalization, which is the total value of a specific cryptocurrency in circulation, but wait...there's more you need to know about market cap. Besides being a crypto valuation tool, market cap offers much more value than you think!  In this video, let's dive into everything you need to know about market cap and how you can minimize your risk of investing by understanding the idea behind it and why it's important in cryptocurrency.

subscribe button check the description for links you can use to connect with me in the bit squad all right guys no more waiting here we go on the adventure to discover the secrecy of cryptocharts so hop on the bus as you guys may know if you follow this series reading charts is a basic technique of technical analysis in which traders will rely on historic statistics and metrics to analyze market movements looking at all these confusing lines and shapes seems daunting at first but don't worry it's not that difficult to digest if you know where to start and i'm here to show you every tip that works cryptocharts can be displayed with various time frames depending on your intention you can choose to sort out a graph for 15 minutes one hour 24 hours the whole week or all the existence of a project it also reflects your trading style day traders often concentrate on short periods so they can extract the best shots within the same day swing traders may want to look at a longer duration for example a couple of days or a week to detect price moves while long-term investors may look at periods of months or years there are different ways to visualize cryptocharts so you should get familiar with that price can be displayed in a simple line which merely describes price changes during the selected time line charts are divided into two types logarithmic scale and linear or aka a rhythmic scale the linear scale represents price changes in absolute values while the log scale draws the reversal in percentages sometimes these two lines look a lot alike the only difference is the vertical scale price in linear charts is chopped off equally while in log charts the price scale is divided by percentage changes you should be able to tell which one you're looking at log charts often set the default view as it better reflects the trend and amplitude of the total price you can also look at below these charts for the volume indicator which presents how much crypto has been traded in that period combined with a price chart volume indicators can help build the most vivid picture over the market if you notice both the price and the volume are increasing it may simply imply people are rushing to buy and the rally is possibly continuing on the other hand if the price goes up but cannot accelerate the purchasing power means traders are still skeptical of a bubble another chart that you might have heard quite often is candlestick pattern sound familiar we've already talked about it at least a dozen times in these previous videos now let's do a recap in case you weren't paying attention candlestick charts provide much more informative data not only price moves and volumes but also include the opening and closing price the highest and lowest level in one session it's so popular to see candlestick dashboards with subsequent columns full in green and red that may remind you green illustrates an uptrend while red is for a downtrend there are different types of candlesticks but in this video i'm going to re-emphasize the most common patterns you will see while trading the bull market has two typical candlesticks which are the hammer and the reverse hammer they are specified by green color whereas in the hammer the thick column lines on the top the tail below resembling an uptrend following after a downtrend the reverse hammer has the thick column hung at the bottom indicating a more stable uptrend throughout the session conversely there are hanging mans and shooting star candlestick patterns which symbol the bearish market the hanging man with the red thick column on the top of the line giving a signal about a recession after a bull while the shooting star has the red at the bottom warning about a mainstream downtrend movement you can look at a market depth chart to get a picture of the supply and demand of the current market in this chart the green area indicates the number of coins and buy orders at that moment while the red area shows the sell amount at that current price the connecting point between the two sides is the current market price you can move your mouse anywhere to take a closer look at the specified price and sold or bought amount you cannot merely view the line chart or candlestick chart in a single day so i'm going to present you some extra techniques and indicators to help you capture the trend over a set period two basic indicators you might hear often are support and resistance the support line is used to point out the bottom of a downtrend in which the plunge is expected to bounce back and push the price back up on the other hand the resistance line refers to a level on the top where an uptrend may defer technically the support line indicates the lowest price so traders can buy the dip and resistance is the highest price in a bull market for doing that after that an inverted trend will take place making the market balanced again next we will have moving averages while the simple moving averages are pretty appropriate for showing the trending lines by connecting different averages in market price i'll give you an advanced variant of that which is called moving averages convergence divergence the macd main line is generated from the subtraction of two of the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages or emas plus there is a signal line from a 9 day ema each macd creates a historiogram based on the difference between the two emas i have to admit it sounds quite complex but hang on you just need to understand that a positive macd line above the zero lines refers to an uptrend otherwise it's in a downside and when the macd line is above the signal line it often indicates the entry point the opposite situation might suggest the time to exit guys are you still with me where did everybody go the lecture is not over yet oh you're still here thank you you've already completed about 99 of this journey don't give up as you have with all the other objectives you've ever set for yourself just finish the last 10 this next indicator also uses the simple moving average and it's called bollinger bands just as the name suggests the bollinger bands add an upper and lower band factoring by the standard deviations around the moving average the moving average line moves closer to the upper band it typifies an overbought market state the other situation indicates an oversold state the wider the bands the more volatile the coins and the wider their of swing now for the last indicator i want to mention the relative strength index or rsi this specifies market momentum via overbought and oversold states which are illustrated by two lines across the chart usually assigned from default values 70 percent were overbought and 30 oversold in theory when rsi line crosses the upper or lower line it blows a whistle does the market buying or selling orders are too much then the trend is probably going to rebound and push the price back to the balance level hence when you see the market is in an overbought state the rsi goes below 70. it is the signal to sell on the opposite when the market is oversold the rsi exceeds 30 it's time to buy as i promised i've made this video truly informative don't grumble or resent me as i know this was a lot of information take your time and digest all the tips you'll be amazed at just how helpful they are when you truly begin to make the best out of these charts but now it's your turn which indicators do you find most efficient for analyzing crypto prices what other types of charts do you find useful when trading let

Brad Garlinghouse: RIPPLE BULL RUN CONFIRMED! XRP PRICE PREDICTION,"Ripple (XRP) Price Breaks Above the Multi-Year Consolidation: Here is What it Means for the Crypto Space  The XRP price has maintained a steep ascending trend ever since the token rebounded from the March 2020 lows. The price further went up by more than 1000% and also encountered a drastic bear market, losing over 80% of its gains. Regardless of the bullish or bearish trend prevailing within the market, the XRP price held the lower ascending trend line, which has been acting as a strong support since then. Now that the price has soared beyond its bearish reach, the token is believed to mark a dollar milestone anytime from now.  The XRP price jumps by over 20% in just a few hours, aiming to reach levels above $0.8, which may occur anytime from now. With this, the optimism around XRP has surged as the token lands up as one of the top performers compared to the last several days, largely driven by memecoins. After remaining behind the crypto market trends for a long time, the XRP price has finally triggered a bullish trend.  #ripple #xrp #sec",Transcript not available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uOg1vPr4Vg,['XRP'],https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uOg1vPr4Vg/hqdefault_live.jpg,2024-12-04T05:00:27Z,"{'XRP': {'positive': 0, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 0}}",{}

standpoint that are really interesting right now very interesting times to be looking at these cryptos and you know we'll be talking about cardano xrp uh some of the meme coins Bitcoin salana so stay through to the end of the video I put some pressure on him towards the end give me one that you think will outperform everything else uh within reason right so we'll be going through those also if you want to trade crypto there's a link underneath the video to btcc you can start trading there in just a few seconds and with the link underneath the video you get 10% bonus on first-time deposits and all users that use that link will get lower trading fees so definitely check that out if you want to leverage trade I've been doing this and you can make a ton of money from it of course make sure that you understand the risks and all that but check it out underneath the video now let's get over to Tyler I'll have his link underneath as well Tyler thanks so much for coming back on the channel as I said your links are going to be underneath the video what are you seeing in the market right now man things are getting insane I mean obviously you know we have Bitcoin pushing up to 100K right now um is it going to hit it honestly don't know I've always said that when we get to 100K it's just gonna be it might be on edge for a while just because everyone's expecting it to get there and because they're expecting it to get there it very well might not get there just in the shorter term time frames but you know what I'm looking at personally right now is the fact that where we're at right now is kind of just extra like everybody wants it to hit 100K just because they want to see 100K but do you remember whenever I came on your channel this was about a month and a half ago and I can go find the link we were talking about the fact that we saw this thing building up and you were like so what if we're going to look at a bitcoin price prediction where do you think that we could go I was like well if things get absolutely ridiculously bullish out of nowhere I think we would do something called a 1.618 Fibonacci extension which puts us around $95,000 that was my ultra bullish guess as to where we went and you can see that's where we are now and so interestingly enough like even though Bitcoin is pushing up right now and it feels great it's already completed the ultra bullish move that we needed to see on the midterm right so even if it starts to pull back now it's not a big deal it made that move that will open up the door for it to push up towards 130 140 150k already getting up to 100K right now is just extra it's just a cherry on top we don't need it because if you look back at say 2021 for example right you can see what happened here although 2021 was a little bit more bullish right things were a little bit more uh just yeah just bullish in terms of whenever we got up to the same level you can see what happened here once we were able to surpass this 1.618 Fibonacci extension Zone we saw a big old pull we went a little higher but we saw a big old pullback and we cooled down for about a month there but then it didn't matter because bitcoin's price was able to continue up higher towards that more overextended all-time high which is what I'm looking for here and so in A Moment Like This A's not a I was talking about a in a video just now but bitcoin's already done the move it's already broke that door that's going to open up for us to get up to 130 so I don't I don't even particularly care if we don't get to 100K right now so this is ultra bullish this is like the most bullish scenario that it possibly could have been for Bitcoin in the short term so whatever happens next hey man I'm just I'm I'm kind of just chilling with it I'm all good yeah yeah awesome and obviously like bitcoin's doing really well who knows if someone just smashes the buy button just so that they can be the person to make it go over 100,000 um there's much purchasing out there but obviously Al starting to move too xrp made a massive move salana made a nice move cardano um maybe we can go through some of those you can say If you think maybe they're a good price to buy or what do you think the price action is on those sure so let's start with salana because salana is in a bit of a different situation than most cryptos because it is in price Discovery already at this point and maybe not fully right we are still kind of interacting with that previous all-time high but we have seen split moments where we've broken it and I'll dive a bit into Ada and xrp because they're making very similar moves so with salana right now for example it's just going to show that okay whenever you think about the liquidity Cycles in crypto we all know that when Bitcoin moves the most likely ones to move in tandem with Bitcoin are going to be the ones that are the closest to Bitcoin in in the like the terms of safety right so if Bitcoin goes up you can expect your ethereums to go up your salonas to go up the ones that have stuck around been around people trust the the ones everyone right and so in A Moment Like This salana quite simply is going up just because Bitcoin is you know just pushing liquidity down into the market and people are funneling that liquidity in people are starting to expect now that bitcoin's price is hit 100K that it's going to begin you know altcoin seasion to start sometime pretty soon if you look at something like Bitcoin dominance we have it here you can see that it is creating a bearish structure this is a sort of structure that will usually break to the downside so I think people are starting to try to front run this move they're expecting altcoins to start outperforming B coin soon so they're going to those next ones they're going to the ones that they think are going to perform well such as the salana now salana itself I personally don't think it's in a great Zone to buy right now and the only reason that I say that is because it's making an insane decision the decision it's making is am I going to break my all-time high or not right we can see here of course it's had that moment where it's gone above it but realistically you just you delete all this and you just look at it for what it is Salam is trying to decide right now whether or not we're going to break this zone or not and so trying to buy a crypto while at all-time high resistance is never a good idea in my opinion you could literally buy it $10 higher than it is right now and it'd be a better time than buying it right now quite simply because it has now broken down this barrier that stopped the bull market last time because people forget that this is the area that stopped sana's bull market it's not just a weak little measly point of resistance it's a major point of resistance and so for salana right now the only thing that even remotely matters is whether or not it's capable of breaking it if it doesn't we might see it come back down and start retesting these previous points of resistance possibly back as low as $200 but if we do break it hey the door is now wide open I've said $350 salana has been on the way for a while now and that might be the opportunity that we might need for it to get up there so for salana at this moment it's moving as a result of the liquidity being front run I think and as a result of that a decision is being made for salana now if we move into something like Ada and xrp the picture is a little different and the picture is a lot more exciting in my opinion um which is I never ever thought I would say that the picture for aen and xrp is more exciting than salana right now but what we can see is that they've not gotten that traction yet salana obviously front run all this thing salana was the first mem coin choice of the people right so this year salana was obviously the one smashing it but a and xrp are now coming into their own it's kind of like their moment right now and what you can see is that although things have been bullish recently and good they're really just getting started because if you look at the macro structure of both aah cardano I'll this out obviously we have this macro structure here when macro just means in the grand scheme of things really and then you look at xrp we're getting very similar pictures and these pictures are a picture of two and a half years worth of building one of the biggest bullish structures that I've ever seen in crypto before I have not seen this before I've never seen an entire bare Market form one structure to push into the bull market in my life and so because of that whenever I look at something like xrp that's broken out of that structure broken at 618 to 786 zone is aiming for that all-time high and a cardano that just today is breaking out of that structure aiming at an all-time high with a breakout Target of Target of $3 for Ada and one of about $3 and roughly 50 to3 $335 to $3.50 for xrp I'm looking at these things saying oh they might just be getting started they like sure in the short term they might pull back they might cool down we might see them have to relax indicators reset it happens we're around the holidays people are it's Black Friday coming up people are going to want to spend some money they might pull some profits but in the grand scheme of things both Ada and xrp as a result of that liquidity starting to drain into the altcoin markets have finally now started to break out of structures that could push them up another two three fourx from here over the long term so the picture is insane for those ones maybe even a little bit crazier for salana which again I quite frankly never ever thought I would hear myself say out loud so yeah so those are your bull market price predictions somewhat conservative but not like not like super sandbagged but um that's kind of your thoughts on kind of the top of the market or just like in the next couple months while we play out this so so I always lean in favor of being conservative because if I'm wrong great you know what I mean if I'm wrong and it goes further than that fantastic I think that there's a decent sized chance that we see the total market cap of altcoins hit roughly around $45 trillion dollar I think that that makes sense that would put the total market cap somewhere of crypto though 9 trillion 10 trillion if bitcoin's still in control if bitcoin's not in control a little bit lower maybe we see altcoin total market cap go to n or five trillion roughly right if that is the case and we do see a similar order of altcoins which things will change some will pop up and do better than others whatever that's going to put Adas xrps Salas 3 Xing 4 Xing four and a half Xing from here which is good people oftentimes look at salana and they think salana is going to $3,000 a cycle no it's not I like I don't mean to be the bear of news but salana is not going to be worth over a trillion dollar or2 trillion dollars just in the next couple months maybe if this is a continue thing over three four years maybe so but do I think it's going that high no and trust me I'm not a salon bear I bought this thing at 10 bucks when everybody was leaving but we just have to be realistic here a 4X in the top 10 right now is very good because the risk now for something like salana or ethereum is incredibly low like the risk of ethereum just disappearing right now very low and so as the risk goes down the reward will diminish it's just the natural way that this flows and so for me yeah I think if we're looking at the top 10 3x 4X something around there makes sense to me maybe a little bit closer to a 3X or something like salana makes sense for me yeah I think people have to understand too as the price gets higher the price risk goes up like the chance that we can get pullback but the underlying crypto is probably stronger than ever like when Bitcoin goes up to 200,000 there are more people that hold it than ever the people have more power it's more decentralized uh or there the bitcoin's in stronger hand so it's better but you could also see a pullback easier than you could at I don't know 30,000 or something like that um how about meme coins obviously meme coins are some of the best performers this year and I know you have to go so I love kind of your quick takes on some of the top performing meme coins too yeah so meme coins are giving me good signs right now I'm actually really liking what I'm seeing there and you know I haven't talked about meme coins on my own channel in a like outside of the the biggest ones in a while because you know micro caps smaller ones DJ meme coins they're not doing that good we have peanut the squirrel doing good we have chill guy coming out but those are they they pale in comparison to like whenever Pepe released last year when we saw bunk go off earlier this year or even you know some of the avac meme coins that popped off in like December of last year right they're not really doing the same things and so it does feel like we're still kind of early on the meme coin scene I don't quite think we're seeing that momentum really hit them yet and you're starting to recognize that especially if you look at the charts for example you look at something like Sheba enu shibba enu is really just starting to gain momentum we of course have seen these bullish structures it did create a da a daily inverse Head and Shoulders back here it has a breakout Target that it's not even hit yet right like it it broke out of that that inverse Head and Shoulders came back down it's building a foundation it's not even hit that point yet now the question then becomes are we building a cup and handle pattern that's an interesting thought to have because of so things could get much crazier but at the end of the day in general you look at sh sh's not really gotten there yet it's not really caught that momentum like you would expect it to yet because it's not time yet you look at something like Pepe Pepe is moving a little bit better but Pepe substantially smaller whenever we're talking about you know market caps I mean sure Pepe is getting up there but when we consider how big Pepe could get Pepe has a rather small market cap so when I look at Pepe sure it might be creating an all-time high fantastic but at the end of the day I still think this thing could go substantially higher from here if we enter into a parabolic bull run a Pepe Pepe hitting the same similar market cap range that something like Doge or Shiva enu did in 2021 isn't difficult especially something like Shiva enu I can see that happening Pepe is probably one of the most notable meme coins that there is now with one of the strongest and most Psychopathic communities and I am in that community so I'm also a psychopath don't get me wrong and so with that in mind I look at Pepe Pepe is just getting started you look at something like Bon yes sure Bonk might be putting in an all-time high right now and you know yeah it's doing a good job of it it's broke above these previous highs trying to build a foundation as we speak but this is just the beginning I feel like we're just putting some of the earlier layers on the cake right now because if you truly know how mein's opera this isn't what a top of a mcoin cycle looks like it doesn't look like this it it surely doesn't look like that and it really for sure does by no means look like this and so for me with mean coins still feels very early I still feel like liquidity is kind of going their way because retail is getting excited but when we see liquidity really hit mean coins people will know you you'll just kind of no like oh snap this is the top of the cycle so for meme coins man they're all starting to break out they're all starting to make some decent moves to the upside and maybe even set some all-time Highs but from a grand scheme of things these ones I mean we're still talking Pro possible 10 x's on some of them and that's crazy because some of them are already in the billions so I think we're still rather early into this portion of the cycle last question gonna kind of put you on the spot here obviously like a rising tide lift all boats so everything's looking bullish bitcoin's looking bullish what do you see outperforming the rest of the market so maybe you know everything is going to 3x but this might go 8X or 10x or something like that and I know this is you not Financial advice and stuff like that but obviously like Bitcoin dominance has moved up a lot over the last two years is there something that can do that so something or like a specific crypto or a specific Niche what are we thinking either or I would say I would say if I was going to go somewhere in the middle if I was going to aim somewhere in the middle I would personally say that your more legendary status meme coins are probably going to outperform the majority of everything in the best way of risk versus reward so obviously salana might 2x or 3x cool not to say no one cares but no one cares Bitcoin might 2x or 3x no one cares this is crypto we're all degenerates we all want more than that right but if you want 100x you're going to be playing with fire you're going to get rug pulled over and over and over again it's just what's it has to happen of course there are private sales but Private Sales are a little bit hard to get into maybe you know if you're a KO it's easy but if you're not it's kind of difficult right and so those can be a little bit off boundary so I don't want to go that far but also I don't want to go down to like New Meme coins because quite frankly the mem coins that are going to perform the best haven't even launched yet they're not even here yet there's going to be the one that comes out and then sends it to 5 billion for no reason at all it's not come out yet so knowing that it's not come out yet if I had to go a step higher I'll go to Your Meme coins and I'm talking your bretts I'm talking your Pepe your bon your whs those ones I think those ones that are legendary from like 2022 2023 but they've not seen a real bull market yet look for those to do the best because obviously does Sheba cool I think they'll do great but they're big they're already big but when I look at something like a Brett that has so much of a community and momentum behind it but has not seen a real bull market yet I think that's where if you want some good gain still a 10x 15x possible 20x with less risk that's where I would be aiming for so let's go with that let's go with that for a change yeah I think that makes sense and obviously like we're investing in meme coins and so Approach at your own risk but Brett right now is a$ 1.5 billion market cap I think Sheba hit 40 billion last cycle so if it hits something similar you're looking at a 25x or something like that dogecoins at a 58 billion dollar market cap right now so yeah when you just compare it it's not even close Tyler thanks so much for coming on I'll leave a link to your channel underneath the video uh yeah we'll have to do this again because the price action is super interesting recently sure no absolutely and again hey you know I I've said it every time I've come on this channel and one thing that I always say when I like to go is just keep sticking to your strategies everyone it's it's gonna right now things are kind of chill they actually feel good to me like the moment everything kind of cooled down a little bit calmed down it's like yeah bitcoin's creeping up to 99 but it's not moving 10K in a day I like moments like this and so in A Moment Like This take advantage of it go back look at what happened last week did you freak out did you buy and sell for no reason did you start making crazy moves figure out the mistakes that were made last week to make sure that when that crazy time comes again which it will come again you're a little bit better prepared so keep developing keep reving the strategies sticking to them and we'll be here to you know do our best to keep guiding everybody as much as possible yeah definitely you don't want to be the person that keeps on shifting to the flashiest crypto and then end up not making anything when you're in the entire full Market Tyler thanks so much see you in the next one see

Introduction","hey guys and welcome to another episode right now we're seeing one of the biggest crypto bull runs as Bitcoin has exceeded its alltime high just a month before the crypto having this means we might see some projects increase in value by 10 100 or even 1,000 times in the upcoming months however investing in crypto isn't always easy some projects end up worth nothing causing investors to lose all their money just like any other Market the crypto Market has both opportunities and risks so making a profit depends on finding the right coins to invest in so in this video we're going to give you a brief explanation of the crypto Market Basics and what you need to think about when you're looking to trade and invest in coins we'll give you a step-by-step guide on how to trade crypto coins and the platforms you can use plus a few tips that can boost your returns finally we'll provide a rules-based trading setup to help you find the best positions to enter the market based onch technical situations so guys if that's something you're interested in hit the like button to show your support and subscribe to our Channel if you're new since we share Advanced trading knowledge see you after the intro and [Music] disclaimer as I mentioned earlier Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time high just just a month before the Bitcoin having but what exactly is Bitcoin having and why is it important every 4 years the block reward for Bitcoin miners is haved in an event called Bitcoin having this will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins are issued but will it impact the price of Bitcoin and cause it to rise let's answer this question by examining the Bitcoin price during the previous 12 July 2016 and may 2020 if we look at the short-term price chart immediately after the 2 to 3 weeks following the Bitcoin having events we can see that not much usually happens typically it only brings volatility but what about a longer term period like 3 to 6 months after the having event in the 2012 having we experienced a major rally and by April the Bitcoin price had significantly increased up to 10 times within 6 months in the 2016 having a very similar pattern emerged the price began a one-year-long major bull market driving the Bitcoin price from $600 to $118,000 then in 2020 we saw a six-month ranging market for Bitcoin before it started to take off so what can we conclude from all this data overall we can conclude that the market Direction tends to be bullish and eventually the cycle does take off however the exact timing of when the rout R can begin is very hard to predict we may still witness a sideways Market even a couple of months after the having event when bitcoin's price Rises it can create a positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency Market leading to increased investor confidence and investment flows into other cryptocurrencies as well this can result in a general uptrend across many cryptocurrencies however it doesn't necessarily guarantee that all other coins will rise simultaneously despite this fact investors often prefer to invest in smaller cap coins instead of Bitcoin for several reasons these smaller cap coins have the potential for significant price appreciation over a short period which can lead to substantial returns for investors this potential for large gains attracts investors seeking high- risk High reward opportunities but what does smaller cap coin mean this term refers to cryptocurrency coins that have relatively smaller market capitalization compared to the top coins crypto market cap refers to the market capitalization which is the total value of a certain cryptocurrency in circulation it's calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin for example the market cap for Bitcoin was $357 billion as of September 22nd 2022 this means that if you multiplied all the Bitcoins in circulation by the current price of Bitcoin you would get a total market value of $357 billion now when discussing smaller cap coins two terms come to mind altcoins and meme coins altcoin is a general term used to describe any cryptocurrency that serves as an alternative to bitcoin these coins cover a wide range of projects and can vary greatly in terms of their technology uses and Market values altcoins include cryptocurrencies like ethereum Ripple Litecoin and others they often aim to tackle specific limitations of Bitcoin such as scalability privacy or functionality and may offer unique features or applications meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency that is primarily influenced by internet memes social media trends and Community involvement rather than fundamental technological or financial principles meme coins often have a light-hearted or satirical nature and may be created as a joke or parody of traditional cryptocurrencies the value and popularity of meme coins are usually driven by viral internet friends social media influencers and online communities rather than underlying technology or utility examples of meme coins include Dogecoin Sheba enu Pepe and other cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or cultural references in summary while altcoins cover a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies with diverse features and purposes mem coins specifically refer to cryptocurrencies characterized by their Reliance on memes internet culture and and community-driven narratives trading meme coins carries an exceptionally high level of risk they tend to either Skyrocket by thousands of times or plummet to zero with very little middle ground smaller market cap cryptocurrencies inherently come with high risk but also offer the potential for higher rewards conversely large cap cryptos are lower risk but may not yield as significant returns midcaps fall somewhere in between it's important to note that mem coins typically fall at the extreme end of the small market caps Spectrum their micromarket caps pose an extremely high risk but also offer potentially High rewards it's prudent to maintain a balanced crypto portfolio comprising large caps midcaps and small caps if you examine the chart of nearly every meme coin you'll notice a similar pattern it usually begins with a big jump in value because people are speculating followed by a crash a few recovery waves and then a period of range this pattern often occurs because many Bots invest in meme coins they find on decentralized Exchange aggregators like Dex tools hoping for quick gains which rarely materialize once meme coins Flatline there are two possibilities either they Fade Into Obscurity or experience a recovery however it usually takes a significant Catalyst to awaken a meme coin from its Slumber unfortunately for most meme coins this Catalyst never materializes in theory it's impossible to predict if and when this revival Catalyst will occur how however in practice there are several factors to consider that could increase the likelihood of such an event which we will cover in the next videos now we come to the question of how to buy and sell crypto coins many platforms enable you to do so but the crucial Point here is that before you begin trading on any platform you must have a well-defined crypto trading and risk management strategy one of the platforms for trading and investing in cryptocurrencies is bybit bybit is among the highest rated cryptocurrency exchanges globally and according to coin gecko it ranks as the second largest cryptocurrency exchange after binance if you don't have a buybit account yet you can sign up using the link provided in the description once you've created your account navigate to the market overview on the homepage here you can access the list of cryptocurrencies available on buybit along with a wealth of useful information here you can also select any category to view related cryptocurrencies clicking on the details will open a page you can find information related to that coin such as market cap trading volume and a brief explanation of the coin itself if you click on trade a page opens that allows you to access the price chart and trading tools to analyze the current technical situation of the market you can also Place buy and sell orders directly from this page and search for any crypto currency you want from the top left corner now we've reached the part of technical analysis and in the trading setup to enter the market it's important to note that technical analysis remains relevant across different platforms so if you have a trading strategy that works well for you in Forex the same strategy will likely work in the crypto Market as well however we recommend a trading strategy that relies on Market Direction higher timef frame key levels and optimal retracement levels to enter the crypto Market in this part of the video we'll present a step-by-step guide to a trading strategy that integrates all of these Concepts but before we continue if you've enjoyed this video so far make sure to hit the like button to show your support and comment below to tell us what topics you want us to cover next the first step of this trading plan is to identify Market Direction you can use any time frame to start with depending on whether you're seeking a short-term or long-term trade however we recommend using higher time frames such as 4 hours and 1 hour to determine the current market Direction since lower time frames can contain a lot of noise it could be frustrating to identify the market sentiment as we start our analysis on the 1hour chart our first step is to draw the market structure schematic to understand the market Direction and structure this schematic is outlined from the lowest point to the highest points of visible swings for example here this could show the swings of Market structure for this chart Additionally you can draw some internal structures onto the chart as well however the main goal of drawing a schematic is to see the recent movements of bulls and bears in the line chart to get a clearer idea of who is in control so try to make it as simple as possible in a bullish Market we simply want the price to respect the demand areas and continue making higher highs and higher lows if the price breaks and closes below a demand area it shows that the buyers are losing control if it continues to make one two and three moves to the downside then we will potentially witness a new bearish trend on the other hand if it breaks the high to the upside it indicates that the buyers are still in control and we can look for long opportunities the same concept is applied to the bearish scenario now after identifying the direction we would zoom out to higher time frames to find higher time frame key levels the main reason for identifying higher time frame key levels is to see how much space we have before reaching the next important level in front of the price and to determine where to set our long-term targets for this top- down analysis we use three time frames weekly daily and 4H hour when identifying key levels we mainly focus on some of the most important criteria first more touches are better more touches indicate that more people are paying attention to that area and when the price reaches that level they are more likely to react second long Wicks indicate that the price has been immediately rejected increasing the like Ood of rejection again third a drastic move away with imbalance suggests that many participants and a significant amount of money have taken action in that area now after identifying higher time frame key levels it's time to search for a trading setup and execute the trade as mentioned earlier you can use any trading setup that works for you however it's crucial to conduct your own back testing before placing any trades with real money back testing helps you build the necessary confidence and assess the performance of your trading setup unfortunately back testing can be timec consuming that's why we use trade regge to save time and keep track of all our back testing once you have completed the back testing Trader Edge will provide a detailed Matrix with Vital Information including win rate maximum draw down profit gains and more if you'd like to try a 7-Day free trial check the link in the description now the trading setup we recommend for entering the position is is based on simple retracement and Fibonacci levels essentially when trading crypto coins you want to buy low and sell high once we've identified the latest impulsive movement aligned with the direction we will apply the Fibonacci retracement tool from the start of the move to the end anywhere between the 61.8% and 78.6% levels is an excellent area to place a long position in the bullish scenario the same principle applies to the bearish scenario our stop loss Will will be placed below the swing low to protect our position and we can Target the first level in front of the price now let's apply all of the concept step by step on the chart here on the sa 1hour time frame we can see that the market has recently shifted to a bullish Market by breaking above these Supply zones this is our latest Market schematic and it's clearly making higher highs and higher lows now let's zoom out to the higher time frame to see the bigger picture here on the daily time frame we can identify two key levels near the current price so we draw them in now let's zoom into the 4 hours in the 4 hours first we adjust the daily levels based on the 4our candles and then draw 4our levels if visible we can see that this level has acted as both support and resistance multiple times so we draw it in the 4-Hour price action shows that the price has recently rejected the daily level and we still have room before reaching the next key level so let's return to the 1hour chart and execute the trade on the 1our chart we can see that our latest impulsive move started somewhere around here and extended all the way up to here we will apply the Fibonacci retracement tool and mark the area between the 61.8% and 78.6% levels this is our optimal demand zone for trade you can either set a buy position in the middle of this range put your stop below the swing low and Target the next level in front of the price price alternatively you can wait for a pullback and zoom into lower time frames to find more confirmation this confirmation could be a double bottom inside this range now this is a perfect example of a price action trading plan where we have combined the market Direction higher time frame key levels and retracement levels to enter the market the crypto Market has the potential to yield massive profits but it also carries significant risks that's why you need to have a solid risk management plan when placing trades so guys that's it for this video I hope this video provided value to you if it did please go ahead and smash the like

period of time meaning over the next 12 to 14 months not tomorrow not next week not next month over the next year it may or may not happen nothing may happen everything may go to zero however if the altcoin season cycle that has been happening since around 2017 after the 2016 Bitcoin having event plays out as it has historically we could see some insane upward price action before crashing back down to where we have been over the past few years or even lower the most common question I receive is what cryptocurrencies to buy and as we've been discussing if we look at the price charts of 90% of all the cryptocurrencies in previous Cycles they all experience similar price action unless a project is a blatant scam experiences a rogue pool encounters a glitch hack or similar literally everything goes up around the same time and C cashes down at the same time so let's go over the cryptocurrencies I'm considering rolling the dys on willing and able to lose it all lose every scent of whatever I throw in trying to buy low now to hopefully potentially sell High later in this crazy crypto Casino hello I'm crypto Casey in this video we are going to explore the cryptocurrencies I'm thinking about gambling on this potentially last big crypto Bull Run let's hit it please be sure to check out our sponsors Ledger tangum and go baby trade as crypto investors we need to diversify technological risk with different wallets that serve different purposes Ledger offers premium crypto wallets with extra security layers like Ledger stacks and flex devices think of them as a safe or

we've been getting a lot of great feedback over the past few months Join one of their free weekly webinars to learn more so scroll down and use links below to redeem any special offers they have for us all right before jumping in here are six things to keep in mind throughout this video one this is Absolut not Financial advice these are cryptocurrencies I'm watching as potential Casino picks that I am fully prepared to lose every single sent on two I am not affiliated with any of these projects the channel is not sponsored by any of these projects I have no contact with anybody that works with these projects I have no Insight or knowledge about these projects whatever anyone can find on the internet about these projects is all I have access to three I have no idea if we are actually going to experience a huge altcoin bull run the market could be be manipulated upwards or downwards some unforeseen Black Swan event could cause it all to come crashing down a glitch or huge hack could send us spiraling into Oblivion World War III could break out and kill us all a pandemic could break out and kill us all at the end of the day no one really knows how the crypto markets are going to behave throughout the rest of this year and through 2025 four we all need to assess our own personal unique Financial situations as well as our risk tolerance some people are living paycheck to paycheck some people have spouses kids and pets that rely on them financially some people have a ton of money to throw around with no dependence some people are risk averse and wouldn't be able to get any sleep at night or relax because watching this insane Market terrifies them While others don't feel anything when their portfolios drop 90% or to zero some people are young and have time on their side While others are older no longer working and maybe have a fixed amount of money they need to protect in order to live out the rest of their lives so assess yourself remember the number one rule of gambling crypto never ever gamble more than you can afford to lose five no one can have all the cryptocurrencies there are tens of thousands of them and if you overd diversify into too many of them you are not going to experience as much upside potential so if you're working with $1100 stick to one or two plays if you're working with $11,000 stick to three to six plays $10,000 6 to 12 plays Etc nice and six the most important thing to keep in mind mind is If you experience gains along the way take profits taking profits in the crypto markets is when you are up in a cryptocurrency position and you sell some of it and either convert it into Bitcoin to hold for the long term or you sell some of it for stable coin or cash to diversify into other Investments like stocks real estate or similar or you use the cash to pay off debt or maybe you buy something nice for yourself or use the cash for an experience like a vacation one profit taking strategy may be that once you double your Investments you decide to take out the initial investment for example if you bought $100 worth of a cryptocurrency and the value doubles to 200 then you sell the initial 100 you invested for Bitcoin a stable coin cash or whatever and let the $100 worth of gain stay in the market longer and hopes that it continues to increase another strategy could be that for every 50% increase you sell 25% of it for example if you bought $100 worth of a cryptocurrency and the value increases to $150 then you sell $25 worth basically a profit taking strategy is something everyone needs to decide based on our own unique Financial situations as well as our risk profiles do not be that person that watches a couple hundred bucks turn into a quar million bucks on their coinbase app on their cell phone screen who never sells anything and watches it go to zero I have been that person do not be that person brilliant now that we are all on the same page let's take a look at what alt coins I've got my eye on and I'm considering rolling the Dyson in no particular order note these are all in the gaming and AI space because as we've discussed on the channel these are narratives I'm betting will potentially perform well and just FYI when referencing the video I posted about things to consider to give us an edge in this market when choosing altcoins almost all of these are new to this cycle so not a lot of sell pressure to overcome as the prices hopefully potentially increase in this potential Bull Run they are a part of narratives that I'm betting will potentially perform well which includes gaming and AI I'm using the Morales money tool to decide when to buy and sell positions I choose to take and a lot of these cryptos have been mentioned by big channels in the space with large audiences which give the projects more exposure and potentially helps them perform better all right let's go 0x0 zx0 is an all-in-one privacy exchange featuring a variety of AI based safety tools that redistributes 100% Revenue to zx0 Holders it's currently at 13 cents and in a bearish trend on the weekly using the Morales money line tool once it closes above 23 C it will flip into a bullish Trend at which point may or may not be a decent time to consider getting into a position again with the Moralis money line tool the strategy is when a trend flips from bearish to bullish it may signal a bottom so a good time to buy and when the trend flips from bullish to bearish it may signal a top so a good time to sell cool next pal AI pal is a powerful AI ecosystem that allows us to create and integrate a Advanced crypto and AI Bots with telegram Discord or anywhere else to provide insights and analytics it's currently at 21 cents and in a bearish trend once it closes above 35 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend Destra network dsync is the first onchain One-Stop solution for cloud Ai and dpin or decentralized physical infrastructure needs as we can see from the chart this is a very new project not a lot of pricing data to analyze for Trends yet so definitely something to keep an eye on right now next artificial superintelligence Alliance or fet fetch.ai allows us to develop deploy and manage multi-agent systems in an open AI agent Marketplace it's currently at $138 and in a bearish trend once it closes above $164 it will flip into a bullish Trend node AI or GPU this service allows us to

analyze for Trends yet so keep an eye on it next aoz network aiio is decentralized physical infrastructure for AI Computing fast reliable web 3 data storage web 3 video streaming and more it's currently at 49 cents and in a bearish trend once it closes above 65 cents it will flip into a bullish Trend amazing so those were the projects I'm watching within the AI narrative this potential altcoin Bull Run next up are the gaming plays first we need to make sure our crypto is secure throughout this bull market in ways that make implementing our altcoin strategies safer and more convenient with different Hardware wallets to diversify technological risk tangum wallet is a set of three cards that work just like a set of three house keys that function as backups it's by far the

eye on right now all right last but not least this isn't an AI or gaming play it's a straight up SL BL pull on what I am gambling maybe one of the most popular meme coins this cycle Pepe Pepe does
