Aximetria, you know the Swiss Crypto exchange that was bought by a Russian investment bank? I decided to try some arbitrage trading on their platform.

Here‚Äôs where the scam kicks in. My $105, now in USDT, was suddenly *flagged* as potentially funding terrorist activities. To ""verify the source"" and withdraw the funds, they asked me to deposit an additional 250 USDT into my account. Odd, but the system assured me that the funds would go straight into my wallet, and everything seemed to match up. So, despite my better judgment, I sent the 250 USDT. I received a message stating, ""We are processing the transfer. If your funds are not released within 2 hours, contact customer support."" Two hours later, nothing. I contacted support, and guess what? They now demand 532 USDT to unlock my funds‚Äî but they did say that there is no expiration window on the transfer (so that's good, I guess). For now, I can trade the funds within the exchange but can‚Äôt withdraw them. **Here‚Äôs my question:** What‚Äôs a coin that‚Äôs likely to fail miserably‚Äîsomething I can buy using these trapped funds‚Äîso that at least I don‚Äôt inadvertently end up funding a warzone? **TL;DR:** Aximetria has effectively locked my funds, demanding I deposit 532 USDT to withdraw.",[],{},{},,,,

So, for fun I‚Äôve created the following site that gauges if we are in an alt season or not using the typical indicators. It utilizes the CoinGecko API and TradingView charts. I wanted to share it with you all to see if you had any feedback or caught anything I had missed. The first issue you will notice is the values on the card do not match the charts. This is because CoinGecko returns the values and TradingView does the charts. The only fix is to create my own charts but that means I need to purchase CoinGeckos Pro API which costs a lot of money lol. However, the values are off by only a few percent and should still be dependable. Please feel free to give me feedback on the site!

Arthur\_0x highlights how this rebirth is driven by a resurgence in metrics like TVL, with platforms like Aave surpassing their 2021 highs. This revitalization is shaping the future of DeFi, with platforms like YieldNest leading the charge. YieldNest‚Äôs MAX LRTs, such as ynETHx, are perfectly suited to this new era. By simplifying complex restaking strategies, they offer both safety and yield in a single token, helping users navigate the evolving DeFi landscape with consistency and risk-adjusted returns. This comes at a time when macro shifts, like lower interest rates, make borrowing cheaper and yields more attractive, further boosting DeFi‚Äôs potential. While sectors like NFTs and gaming are still refining their product-market fit, DeFi is thriving with innovations such as restaking and basis trading. YieldNest's ynETHx, along with upcoming MAX LRTs like ynBNB, are positioned to capture this momentum, laying the groundwork for the next generation of financial products. With a focus on efficiency, accessibility, and better user experience, DeFi is becoming increasingly available to both retail and institutional players. YieldNest is at the forefront of this shift, making it an exciting time to be part of the DeFi revolution.",['Aave'],"{'Aave': {'positive': 1, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 0}}",{'aave': 1.0},Aave,1.0,Aave,1.0

CEX's have made purchasing and hodl'ing crypto extremely easy. They have simply mirrored what we are used to, banking and brokerage websites. Easy to use with all your fiat and crypto in one place, no need to worry about backing up wallet files, keys, paper wallets etc... BTC ETF's have piled on by offering simple BTC exposure. As we have seen over the years, there are quite a few drawbacks as well. We simply do not know what is going on behind the scenes of a CEX. Are they front running with insider accounts and manipulating the market with stable coins? Are they planning an exit scam? Will the local government simply shut them down? What if a blockchain becomes labeled a security, will it become non transferable/worthless? DEX's on the other hand solve many trust issues however none have made it simple for the general public to utilize. Where a CEX manages all custodial aspects, a DEX requires users to learn each blockchains wallet and how to securely store each crypto. This is a never ending learning curve with how many blockchains are available and frequently updated wallets. Being able to convert from one crypto to another quickly will become inevitable IF crypto becomes more widely accepted as a form of currency. Even one of the oldest DEX's, BitShares, is still difficult to use with low liquidity. Other's have tried to combine the CEX with DEX by utilizing multiple internal CEX accounts and offering a external DEX style appearance, however this creates another layer of trust issues. Will 2025 become the year you self custody crypto and utilize a DEX to exchange or will history repeat itself and big data will always hold us hostage?",[],{},{},,,,

I‚Äôm part of a project called **Phoenix Pass**, and we‚Äôre doing something a little different in the NFT space.

For example, this past month, our yield target was **8 USDT per NFT**, but we ended up delivering **13.62 USDT per NFT (13.62 % in a month)**!

Making CTR mode commiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h2v850/making_ctr_mode_commiting/,,9,0.85,3,cryptoam1,1732912641.0,"JUST, Mode","CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple. I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode.

My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305. PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.","['JUST', 'Mode']","{'JUST': {'positive': 0, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 4}, 'Mode': {'positive': 1, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 9}}","{'just': 0.5, 'mode': 0.5}",Mode,2.75,JUST,1.0

In particular, according to a **report** by Business Research Insights, the global GameFi market was worth $18.49 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $126.17 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 27.13% over the forecast period. Among the main factors that contributed to this growth are the development of the blockchain industry and the popularity of cryptocurrencies. GameFi continues to evolve, and new trends in Web3 game development are shaping the future of this intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. In particular, in 2024, the following trends influenced the development of the market: *Expansion of the Metaverse* The metaverse concept gained a lot of popularity in 2024, and GameFi was at the epicenter of this expansion. More and more platforms are integrating metaverse elements into their ecosystems, offering gamers the opportunity to immerse themselves in a virtual world where they can be rewarded for their participation. In 2024, several GameFi projects launched meta-platforms, offering players a wide range of activities, from virtual real estate development and commerce to social events. Many of these platforms support asset interoperability, which allows the use of NFTs and other digital objects in different games and on different platforms. For example, Decentraland and The Sandbox create realistic virtual worlds where users can interact, play, and trade assets. *The Rise of Tap-to-Earn Models* The launch of mini-apps on the TON blockchain has certainly revolutionized the GameFi industry. DApps on the TON blockchain, running on platforms such as Telegram, provide users with a gaming experience without the need to download or install software. In particular, such applications have popularised the Tap-to-Earn gaming model. Such games are accessible and easy to play, in which users are rewarded for simply touching the screen. A prime example is Notcoin, one of the first T2E games that has soared to the second position among the leading gaming tokens by market capitalization, with a market cap of over $1.6 billion.

Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation): x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s); return x & 1; In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.: \- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version, \- related key attacks, \- timing attacks, \- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread). Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby). Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key: #include <bitset> #include<iostream> //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; }; struct xws initializer(__uint128_t x_init, __uint128_t weyl_init, const __uint128_t s_init) { __uint128_t x = 0; __uint128_t weyl = 0; __uint128_t s = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) { x_init = (-(x_init & 1) & (x_init + ((x_init + 1) >> 1)) | ~- (x_init & 1) & (x_init >> 1)) ^ (weyl_init += s_init); x += (x_init & 1) << i; } for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) { x_init = (-(x_init & 1) & (x_init + ((x_init + 1) >> 1)) | ~- (x_init & 1) & (x_init >> 1)) ^ (weyl_init += s_init); weyl += (x_init & 1) << i; } for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) { x_init = (-(x_init & 1) & (x_init + ((x_init + 1) >> 1)) | ~- (x_init & 1) & (x_init >> 1)) ^ (weyl_init += s_init); s += (x_init & 1) << i; } return xws{x, weyl, s | 1 }; } struct xw { __uint128_t x, weyl; }; //skip is to avoid correlated bitstream results for consecutive s, given the same x and weyl or for example for consecutive weyl, given the same s and x, etc. struct xw skip(__uint128_t x, __uint128_t weyl, const __uint128_t s) { for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) { x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~- (x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s); } return xw{ x, weyl }; } __uint128_t next(__uint128_t& x, __uint128_t& weyl, const __uint128_t& s) { __uint128_t v = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++) { x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s); v += (x & 1) << i; // here we build 128-bit numbers from a single bit returned sequentially by the generator } return v; } int main() { const __uint128_t key = 12345678910111213; //the key must be odd const __uint128_t x_init = key, weyl_init = key, s_init = key; //all these variables must be secret, s_init must be odd xws initialization = initializer(x_init, weyl_init, s_init); __uint128_t x = initialization.x; __uint128_t weyl = initialization.weyl; __uint128_t s = initialization.s; xw skipping = skip(x, weyl, s); x = skipping.x; weyl = skipping.weyl; __uint128_t result = 0; for(int i=0; i<100; i++) { result = next(x, weyl, s); std::cout << std::bitset<64>(result >> 64) << ""\n""; std::cout << std::bitset<64>(result) << ""\n""; } return 0; } An additional feature is backtracking resistance, since it is not based on a bijective function, you must guess at least one bit in each iteration to reverse it, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05079.

The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

The behavior is as follows. \- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically. \- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt(). \- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.) \- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password. \- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future. \- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password.

Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gjbmz8/mlkem_encapsulate_nonrandom_bytes/,,5,0.86,6,justforfunnin,1730718206.0,"Safe, JUST, Secret, Save","I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward. I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well. I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials.

This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N). If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them.

I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme. I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel): 1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key. 2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext. 3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC. However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme. Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?","['Secret', 'WHY']","{'Secret': {'positive': 0, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 5}, 'WHY': {'positive': 0, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 1}}","{'secret': 0.5, 'why': 0.5}",Secret,1.25,WHY,0.25

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Œ®**‚ÇÅ** to Œ®‚Ñì as part of the computation of **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**. # Introducing Œ≥ and Œ¥ : To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars Œ≥ and Œ¥ to force Œ®‚Ñì+1 to Œ®*m* to be separate from Œ®**‚ÇÅ** to Œ®‚Ñì. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**) by Œ≥ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]‚ÇÅ**, the sum the verifier computes) by Œ¥.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e' ---- Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. - s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r) - So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' = Hash(M || sG + eP) ----------------- (Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments > That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ.

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG. I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",[],{},{},,,,

It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We‚Äôve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use. The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support. One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there‚Äôs no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I‚Äôve jumped in to try to fix this. I‚Äôm basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets. Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has ‚Äúmathematical properties‚Äù. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes. And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust: Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I‚Äôll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room. Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We‚Äôre not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I‚Äôm trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints.
